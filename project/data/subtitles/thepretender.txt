Previous scene on The Pretender
Who the hell are you?
I'm your brother.
Jarod, go and find our parents.
Kyle..
You and The FBI killed my brother.
What've I ever done to you?
You exist.
Someone tried to kill Raines,
But the bullet distracked on the oxygen tank.
They can't tell which gun it's fired from.
No, No, Noooooooooooooo!
Well, my father didn't just vanish
I am not his secretary
You're supposed to know where he is.
I hate attitude.
Problem at The Centre?
Well, my father's been at his desk
in The Tower at 7 am for the last thirty-five years.
Two weeks in a row he's been a no show.
That's weird.
There's a great deal of peculiar activity in The Tower of late
and now it's trickling down to us.
Tell me about it.
They've even jacked up the prices in all of the vending machines.
A bag of Funyans sets me back a buck now.
Well it's true.
Let's face it.
The place has been different ever since
Go ahead Broots, say it.
Ever since Raines was shot.
Well don't look at me.
I'm no marksman.
Hey, I didn't even want to take a gun, remember?
Well, if I'd shot sterno head
he would be snoring through dirt now
instead of filling bed-pans in The Centre's burn unit.
Excuse me.
I have met thousands of men
from all walks of life who've sought retreat here
but I've never met anyone like Brother Jarod.
He spent all of his time in his cell.
Barely ate.
Never slept.
But given the severity of his nightmares
I suppose it is understandable.
He had such sadness in his soul.
Not exactly Home and Garden.
Dia De Los Muertos.
The Day of the Dead.
A Mexican Festival
similar to your Halloween
in which cemeteries are prepared to welcome back the departed.
These morbid images may explain
Jarod's long silence.
Indication of some sort of preoccupation with death?
Speaking of death.
Look at this.
A hand carved coffin.
Jarod made it himself.
It was always with him.
The same type of notebook that his brother Kyle used.
Jarod's grieving.
Searching for closure in the loss of his brother.
Then, ah, who's this coffin for?
What's it mean, Freud?
Someone's going to die.
There are pretends among us. Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be.
In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.
Then one day, the pretender ran away...
THE PRETENDER
Season 2
Episode 1
Back From The Dead Again
Who wants to touch?
You're sick!
Ah don't be spooked Chloe.
We're going to be dissecting them all year.
Joel, you shouldn't touch the cadaver until the prof get's here.
Fernando, I have been waiting all year to get into this class.
Besides I don't think this one's gonna mind.
Think again.
Who the hell are you?
Jarod Howard, your new professor.
Oh that's oh that's not funny, man.
And mocking the dead is?
I want each of you to understand
that there's only one unforgivable sin in my class.
I will not under any circumstances
tolerate any disrespect for these cadavers.
Underneath each of these plastic sheets
lies a human being.
Many of these bodies they come to us unknown and unclaimed
which means that they died alone and afraid.
No friends.
No homes.
Forgotten by their families
and thrown away by society.
Therefore they will not be disrespected in this classroom.
Take those words to heart.
Halloween's coming up
and if I hear of a student
taking a head or an arm to a party
I will personally expel them from the program.
Dr Fein.
Will there be enough cadavers for each group this term?
Who's being sick now?
Well if there aren't enough,
there are several pre-dissected bodies from last semester that will be available.
I plan on being a surgeon.
I need to get a feel for what I'm going to do.
I can't learn if it's just pick and point.
As a matter of fact there are more cadavers being delivered after class.
So I will need a couple of volunteers?
I believe that these two
will be just fine.
Finally. Thank God you're back Daddy.
Good news!
We found Jarod's last lair.
Yeck! I'll have it analysed.
But only God knows what he's up to this time.
Who the hell are you?
Nein. Nein.
Warum bist zu.
Ich grosse die vohne der griese.
Wiedersehen.
You must be Miss Parker.
You look just like your mother.
Where's my father?
He's away as I understand it.
-Mr Lyle, your 10:30 is here.
-Send her in.
And, what, Mr Lyle, are you doing in my father's office?
Oh, I'm just filling in.
Bridget. Good morning.
Have you met Miss Parker? Bridget is the new cleaner.
The new cleaner?
I've had the dearama analysed.
A preliminary report on my findings.
How did she get a report on Jarod's last lair
when Sydney and I just returned?
To be honest,
Bridget actually beat you there.
Only by a couple of days.
Ha! Okay.
What am I, in the twilight zone?
We thought it would be a good idea
to have Bridget provide assistance in the capture of Jarod.
I don't need assistance.
And who exactly, is we?
I am.
The powers are tired of the way things have been run;
tired of the inefficiency,
angry that Jarod is still out there.
I don't understand why it's so hard to capture one man.
Jarod's not just a man.
He's a pretender.
A human chameleon.
A genius who can literally become anyone he wants to be.
And he almost found his family, Miss Parker.
-Imagine the ramifications.
-I know.
But we have made progress.
Yes, we.
Is this Sydney, an impediment?
Or should he be removed?
Sydney raised Jarod.
There is an emotional umbilical between them.
Sever it and you'll never see Jarod again.
The Centre is tired of Jarod's actions.
If he's really as smart as you say he is,
and you're really as smart as I hear you are,
I'd think you'd welcome any help you can get
since that'd be the wise thing to do.
We're going to be late.
If you hear from your father, let me know.
Well Jarod.
Your CV is quite impressive.
Undergrad from Vanderbilt,
Masters in anatomy from Duke,
graduated with distinction from University of London.
Great accomplishments for a young man.
Well, I'm a quick study.
I must admit that I'm a little surprised
that you'd be willing to teach gross anatomy to first year med students.
Well actually, I'm here to work with you.
I've been following your progress as a research fellow.
I understand you've made some great strides
with the cardiac resuscitation drug.
My guess, from your history,
it's a blend between class four setacholines
and some sort of generic digitalis.
It's supposed to be a secret.
A pharmaceutical research race with the Brits.
You can't keep that sort of thing quiet.
You're a smart man Jarod.
You should have been an MD instead of a PHD.
Either way they still call me Doctor.
Dr Howard, Dr Fein, Dr Howard!
Yo oh!
See what I mean?
Joel, Fernando.
Take the cadavers to the cold room
and give them a local and formaldehyde wrap.
I've already done it.
Joel works part time at the mortuary.
Sheldon Fein.
Jarod Howard, faculty.
Fein and Fein?
Sheldon and I are brothers.
Christopher became a doctor trying to put the family business out of business.
Fernando. There's Detective Keys.
Maybe you should go talk to her.
Maybe she's found something.
I need to get out of here.
Joel, The vouchers for the cadavers are on my desk.
Get them for ah Sheldon will you?
-Oh, sure.
-Just send them over.
Fernando seems sad.
Yeah, he should.
His brother disappeared last Halloween.
I'll take this body to the lab.
MEDICAL STUDENT ENRIQUE RAMOS VANISHES
MAN SEARCHES FOR LOST BROTHER
Who the hell is Mr Lyle?
All I know is that he is barking a lot of orders
and all the smart people seem to be following them.
Maybe he's part of the Triumvirate.
The Triumvirate?
What the hell would they be doing here?
Assuming power?
Their appearance would certainly explain your father's disappearance.
Not to mention the price of Funyans.
Why would they make my father disappear?
Because someone shot Raines.
Hmm! And they're not going to stop
until they find out who did it.
Well, I'm not going to stop
until I find out who Mr Lyle is.
Yo. Don't tell me you're moving into this dump.
They say it's haunted.
The house?
No. The fence.
This house is a prime Halloween target.
I'm talking eggings, toilet paper, smashed pumpkins.
Tell you what.
For fifty bucks I'll make sure nobody trashes it.
I've heard about this Halloween,
a ritual where people bring body parts to celebrations?
Ain't been invited to one of those.
Around here it's mostly teens
raising hell or kids doing trick or treat things.
Trick or Treat?
What are you?
From Bosnia?
Trick or treat.
Where kids dressed up like goons,
come knock on people's doors and people give them candy.
Oh.
Why?
Because they know you're coming
and if they don't you might trash their house.
So it's extortion.
Now you're catching on, Bosnia boy.
Remember fifty bucks is money well spent.
My name's Bruno.
You need enforcement around here
I'm your man.
I'll remember.
Now take your rib spreader.
Crack open the sternum allowing access to the heart.
Oh man!
It is amazing to think that
once pumped blood through this body.
Now in order to remove the cadaver's heart,
carefully dissect through the pericardial sack.
Now remove the attachments of the aorta
and the pulmonary veins and arteries.
There shouldn't be much fluid.
Excuse me.
Ha ha.
-I'll go make sure he doesn't get it on his shoes!
-Hmm.
The Ancient Greeks believed that
the brain was the home of the consciousness.
And the heart was the home of the soul.
That's an interesting crucifix.
I spent some time in Cuernavaca.
The artisans there they make one very similar.
They made this one.
My grandmother's from Cuernavaca.
She raised us after my parents were killed.
She gave my brother Enrique and me identical ones
before we came here to go to school,
for good luck.
I heard about your brother's disappearance.
I'm sorry.
They say in some cultures
that the bond between brothers
can be so strong that they can feel each other's pain.
Can you feel his?
You have a brother?
Yes.
Do you feel his pain?
Every day.
I feel my brother in my heart
but he can't feel me any more.
Enrique's luck ran out.
I just hope that when his heart stopped
he didn't feel any pain.
Where AM I?
Where am I?
Where am I?
Where am I?
Sydney.
Jarod! It's been so long.
Part of my life is missing.
You sound troubled.
Exhausted.
I can't sleep.
This could be your processing of your emotions
regarding the loss of family.
Your brother?
No I understand that pain.
This is different.
Every time I close my eyes
I go somewhere somewhere terrible.
I get to the same point in this living nightmare but I
I can't finish it I . I can't go on.
Perhaps your subconscious doesn't want to face what lies ahead.
Let me help you.
Tell me where you are.
You tell me where I was.
Where you were?
My entire life is on these DSAs.
From the moment you people stole me to the moment I escaped.
Every breath I took,
every sim I did,
every morsel of food I ate.
Except for the last three weeks in October the year before I escaped.
There must be a mistake.
There is no mistake.
Three weeks of my life is missing.
Now I don't know how I know,
but it has something to do with my fear
and my nightmare.
I need to know what happened.
I need to know what you did to me.
I need to know.
Can I help you?
Just getting my bearings.
Well keep them out of my office.
Right!
Okay. I've checked the summer house,
the estate in Scotland and in Bimamy
and no one knows where your father is.
Larron.
Yes Miss Parker?
If she's ever in my office again I'll kill you.
Yes Miss Parker.
What's he doing out of his hole?
We found something we thought .
Outside.
I don't want to talk in there.
I searched through my old records.
I was in Europe during the missing time that Jarod was talking about.
The precise dates.
So?
It was a pointless symposium but I was ordered to attend by Mr. Raines.
I tell you that all the weirdness around here
is courtesy of Mr. Skin Grafts himself.
Mr Lyle shows up.
Your father disappears.
It's too coincidental to be just a coincidence.
Syd, how is it that half the time you bumble around without a clue
and the other half you're a sage that knows everything?
What's that about?
Survival
Oh. Ah. I'm going to go back to my hole.
First you're going to help me
find out exactly who Mr Lyle is.
And how do you expect me to do that?
Who knows all the dirty secrets around here?
Mr Raines.
Score one for Captain Kangaroo.
While Raines is in the Infirmary
you hack into his archives
and search for any references to Mr Lyle.
Are you crazy?
And while you're rifling through his archives
find out what Raines was doing here while I was in Europe.
Oh God!
Oh come on!
Where are your study partners?
Joel is trying to hold down lunch.
And, ah, Chloe went to get some.
A Day of the Dead Cadaver.
I guess you did spend some time in Cuernavaca.
Yes. A little hobby I picked up when I was there.
Were you teaching?
No, I was a monk.
But I did learn a lot about the Day of the Dead,
and about respecting and remembering those who came before.
Every year when we were little
our grandmother would take us to the our parents' graves,
We would clean and decorate them with the cadavers that we would make.
She would tell us stories about them
and connect us to our roots.
Do you do that at the graves of your relatives?
No. I don't know where they are.
I want to find Enrique
so that I can bury him properly.
You seem sure that he's not alive.
The night he ah disappeared
he decided to skip the Halloween party
and help me study for my pre-med exam.
He never made it home.
Part of me died last Halloween.
It was the part that was connected to my brother.
Some brothers don't have that connection.
Nice place, if you're trying to raise the dead.
I didn't hear you knock.
It's funny!
Neither did I.
You know, most adults aren't into Halloween quite this much.
It's research.
Hey! I downloaded all the back issues of the newspapers like you asked.
Now where's MY paper? .
I know that it's none of my business
but ...
why did you want only the obituaries
for the last few years?
You're right.
It's none of your business.
Here's some trick or treat candy.
I'm particularly fond of the black and orange kind.
Very tasty!
The black and orange kind?
You are from Bosnia.
And I'm way too old for trick or treat.
What do you do on Halloween?
Well, my favourite thing is dried dog poop and some newspaper,
throw it on some old fart's porch,
set it on fire and run.
Why?
Because they come out and stamp on it.
Well, doesn't that mess his shoes?
Oh. Oh!
That's good.
Good evening.
I'm glad I caught you at work.
I missed you in class today.
I'm a little worried about your study.
I'm not sure you're going to make it.
Nah! Don't worry Professor Howard.
I'm not going to let them down.
It's not about you.
It's about Fernando.
His brother couldn't handle it.
I'm not sure that he can.
I knew Enrique and I know Fernando.
He's a rock.
So it's true.
Enrique couldn't take the pressure.
I saw him crack up myself.
I was helping Enrique recruit homeless men
for one of Dr Fein's research projects.
We had to search for this particular fellow called Broad Street Bill.
But when I came in around 11 o'clock for the night shift
Enrique started acting really strange.
He called Dr Fein.
And after work, he went home?
He went out to do a burial first.
At eleven o'clock at night?
We do late burials here all the time.
Saves money or something.
Well Marissa.
If you're dead in my lab,
who's buried in your grave?
Oh my God!
Enrique!
They buried you alive.
You had the nightmare again?
So what was it?
Some kind of narcotics experiment?
Nerve gas test?
Or just the MRI from hell?
Whatever it was, Jarod,
it was done without my knowledge.
I'd been sent to Europe during the missing time.
I'm doing everything I can to get you answers.
Do you ever think about death Sydney?
Not a day goes by
where I don't wonder if it could be my last.
Are you ill?
I work at The Centre.
There are unsettling changes here.
Then walk away.
My work here isn't finished.
Until you are out of jeopardy.
You and
Jacob.
We can't forget our brothers Sydney.
In life or in death.
Oh. Ah. Ha ha ha.
You were so quiet I I
You must get a lot of that around here.
Oh yeah. Funny!
I was waiting for you.
Your brother asked me to give you these vouchers for the cadavers.
Oh. Okay. Thanks.
While I was waiting Detective Keys came by looking for you.
-Detective Keys?
-Hm Hmm.
You know the one.
She's helping Fernando find his brother, Enrique.
Oh, she asked me to give you this.
It's an exhumation order for a woman named Hall.
Marissa Hall.
It's very interesting Detective Keys came by my lab today
and she was fingerprinting cadavers.
There was this pre-dissected cadaver from last year on my slab
and I'll be damned if it isn't the very same Marissa Hall.
Who are you?
Someone who wants to know
how many more of your customers
Detective Keys is going to find in my lab
and someone who wants to know
why Enrique Ramos was buried alive in the grave that he dug.
Oh no.
Yes.
Oh no.
I dug him up myself.
And unless you want to dig your own grave any deeper
I suggest that you tell me what he was doing there.
Last Halloween my brother brought in the body of a homeless man
and told me to cremate it.
Enrique was working later that night
and when he saw the body he got really upset
ah He called my brother
and the next thing I know
my brother shows up looking for him
and I told him Enrique was digging the plot for the Hall woman.
I just assumed that he paid him to leave town.
He wasn't quite that lucky.
Can you believe they've raised the price of snack food.
Oh .. no.
No bother.
It's my job to clean up around here anyway.
Names Bridget.
Cat got your tongue luv?
Oh no.
It's just that I I thought I
I was the only one who ate those things around here.
You've got company now, Mr Broots.
Ha Ha! Thank You
By the way
Mr Raines isn't in his office today.
I really shouldn't be doing this.
Dr Fein doesn't let anybody into this lab.
He gets real paranoid someone's going to poach his data.
Even when I brought him test subjects
they could only come in one at a time.
Like the homeless man you were telling me about?
Broad Street Bill? Yeah. Yeah.
In fact Dr Fein did several tests on him.
And you haven't seen him for a year, have you?
No I haven't.
And you never will.
No one will.
Raines had nothing on Mr Lyle in his archives.
It's like he doesn't exist.
Then why are you wetting your pants?
Why?
Because of that Bridget.
Rumour is she's an assassin.
I know she saw me coming out of Raine's office.
And she called me mister.
What do you think she means by that?
Let's forget Princess Night
and start the damned disk.
This disk is from Raines' private archives.
My God, it's Jarod.
It's from the time you were in Europe
See Nothing special.
Nothing at all.
Let's go.
What's in there?
I don't know.
He never let me go further than here.
We really shouldn't be doing this.
What the hell is that?
Who's that with Mr Raines?
Cardio Benzine. What?
It's used to slow a patient's heart rate.
In large enough doses, to stop it.
Show me the gauges Broots.
My God!
Below freezing.
There! Stop it.
Okay.
Who Who is that?
Mr Lyle.
This freak gets around more than Ed McMahon.
Who is this guy?
I don't know.
And that's what scares me.
Adrenal cortozene.
Dr Fine's experimental blood pressure drug?
Experimental, yes.
Blood pressure, no.
He was using it to revive heart response.
What did he need
what did he need these for?
For when it didn't work.
Jarod's flat-lined.
They were killing him.
That's what they did to me.
Do you think Dr Fein was trying to kill his subjects?
He killed them all.
For a minute or two anyway.
And then he'd revive them.
Broad Street Bill?
The one who didn't come back.
Trick or Treat?
Who wants Pez?
Trick or Treat?
There you go.
Dr Fein?
It's Jarod.
I'm sorry to disturb you
but Sheldon was looking for you.
Something about an exhumation order.
Exhumation?
Did he say who?
Some woman named Hall.
You want me to go down there?
A mix up with the cadavers,
well that could be very bad for the school.
No. No.
Ah, I'll handle it.
Whatever you say boss.
Trick or treat?
You scared the hell out of me.
Well it is after all what this holiday is all about,
isn't it?
Oh you're too late.
He's gone.
Who's gone?
Enrique.
You know.
The other man you killed.
What kind of sick prank are you trying to play?
It isn't a prank.
It's a life lesson.
You know, in some cultures
they believe that the spirit of a man killed in anger
returns to exact revenge on its perpetrators.
Spooky huh?
I'm getting out of here.
Oh no, you can't leave Dr Fein.
This is the Day of the Dead.
And you sir are the special guest.
Let me out of here Jarod.
This isn't funny.
Oh I know.
It would be awful to be buried alive
especially with that on your shoe.
Owww. Jarod.
Sh sh shs sh sh.
There's no reason to wake the dead.
You're going to be joining them soon enough.
Jarod please.
Did Enrique discover that you had killed
one of the research subjects that he had recruited for you?
You're crazy.
Ah ah ahhhh.
That's not a very nice thing to say
to a man with a shovel, is it?
Let me out.
Let me out of here, Jarod, please.
You took an innocent, homeless man
and you turned him into your guinea pig.
Someone to test your heart drug on.
Someone that you didn't think would be missed if it didn't work.
Well it didn't work, did it?
Someone did miss him.
Enrique.
So you buried him alive to save your research.
Didn't you? Didn't you?
Didn't you? Didn't you?
Yes! Yes! Now, let me out of here.
Screaming isn't going to help you conserve your oxygen.
And believe me you're going to need all that you can get.
-No. No. NO! Jarod.
-Happy Halloween.
No Jarod. No Jarod.
Wait fifteen minutes, then call Detective Keys.
Does he have enough air in there?
More than enough.
But he doesn't need to know that.
You know Bosnia boy,
this is the best Halloween I've ever had.
Whoa. A C-.
Will you stop. I didn't get a C-.
Oh yes you did. C-.
-I did not. You got a C- is what I think.
-Very bad.
Oh you, my friend!
You were expecting Florence Nightingale?
What do you want?
Answers.
The kind that only you can give me.
The skin grafts are healing nicely.
Hmm
let's not have another blow up shall we?
Nobody's going to hear us.
Nobody can see us.
And nobody's going to come to save you.
It's just you and me.
Now I want to know where my father is?
Where is my father?
I don't know.
Is he dead?
I don't know.
Who is Mr Lyle?
Who is he?
He's the boogeyman.
They stopped my heart. Why?
I don't know.
Why does Mr Raines do anything he does?
He wasn't alone.
The other man.
Mr Lyle.
He's here at The Centre now.
I won't let this go.
I promise you that.
Well, neither will I.
Will you be alright?
I'll survive.
Even if it is the Day of the Dead.
Halloween.
Which I happen to be late for.
Trick or treating you know.
Dressed as what?
The scariest creature I can think of.
Trick or Treat?
Previous scene on the pretender
Problem of the center?
Well, My father been at his desk in The Tower at 7 am for the last thirty-five years.
-Two weeks in a row he has a no show.
-That's weird.
Thank god. You are Back, Daddy.
Who the hell are you?
Mr. Lyle.
And Bridget is the new cleaner.
What am I, in the twilight zone?
We thought It would be a good idea to have Bridget
provide assistance in the capture of Jarod.
All I know is that he is barking a lot of orders
and all the smart people seem to be following them.
Maybe he's part of the Triumvirate.
The Triumvirate?
What the hell would they be doing here?
Seizing power?
Their appearance certainly would explain your father's disappearance.
Why would they make my father disappear?
Because someone shot Raines.
They are not going to stop until they find out who did.
Who is Mr. Lyle?
He's the boogeyman.
The money was removed from the Center offices on the home through electronicly
We're double checking the transfer records.
We're hoping its an
accounting mistake.
Jarod stole fifteen million dollars of Centre funds and donated it
to charity.
The only mistake is rubbing our noses in it.
ˇ°Your welcome and surprisingly generous donation
will help the organisation for years to come.ˇ±
ˇ°The million dollars will bring
much hope and joy to the children.
God Bless.ˇ±
ˇ°Prayers be with you.
Have a nice day.ˇ±
I'll get him.
Please do.
Jarod's a lot more dangerous than I thought.
I like ice cream.
I really like ice cream.
-There you go Jarod.
-Thank you Phil.
Very interesting device.
It's a Wheelo.
And it's purpose is?
Nothing. It just goes round and round and round.
So it chases itself in a circle?
Yep!
Would you be interested in selling that for ten dollars.
Sorry!
Fifteen?
I couldn't. My grandpa gave it to me for my birthday.
-Twenty?
-Twenty-five!
Sold!
Thank you!
Wow!
Hey Kiddo!
Got you a burger, some fries.
Gonna set you up nice
here. Okay sir. Hey!
I'll be right back. Okay?
How are you doing Scooter?
Dewey! You, you shouldn't come around here.
How else are we supposed to get an ice cream cone.
Freaky weather.
Must be a hundred degrees in the shade.
You look good Scott.
What do you want Nick?
It's not what I want.
It's what I need . . . you.
Oh no. Not this time.
Opportunity knocks.
Oh really?
Because you know your last opportunity cost me seven years of my life.
Jeez! Come on.
Ten months I've been out of prison.
I've just got my son back. Okay?
I'm not interested.
Get interested.
Dad?
Sean, go wait out front. I'll be right there.
Go on Sean. You do as your daddy says now, okay?
-But . . .
-Just go, please.
I see your dilemma.
The deal is one job and you and I are history.
Why don't you get Martinez?
Dead. He said no.
Crew?
The three of us plus one.
Who opens the safe?
Trinnie's sending some guy in from Brooklyn.
One, um, R.H. Cross.
Cross. I don't know him.
I don't know him either.
Trinnie swears by him even though he's only got one good arm.
A one armed safe cracker. That's . . .
I'm picking him up at three o'clock at the train station.
We start tonight.
Scottie, don't be late.
-Hey! Okay.
-What's that?
No. No. It's nothing.
These guys come back and give me a hard
time.
Hey nothing's wrong. Hey! Come here.
The train station.
Leaving town?
Business meeting.
Yeah? What do you do?
I'm a one armed safe cracker.
Yeah? Which
arm?
It's a good question.
There are pretends among us. Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be.
In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.
Then one day, the pretender run away...
THE PRETENDER
Season 2
Episode 2
Scott Free
Jarod is at something.
I can feel it coming on like the flu'.
After his recent brush with death
perhaps he's just enjoying life for a bit.
Maybe he decided to take a vacation.
Did you eat the whole onion for breakfast?
-Broots.
-What?
Sorry you missed the party in Omaha.
Jarod. What about Omaha?
Whoops! I guess the Centre cut you out of the loop this time.
Good thing they sent a replacement.
What are you talking about Jarod?
I'm talking about the blonde.
Five ¨C seven, hundred and twenty
pounds, killer legs.
You're not giving up on me, are you Miss Parker?
You wish.
Your attention please.
-Announcing the immediate arrival of the Brooklyn Express at platform sixteen.
-That's my train. Gotta go.
What was that all about?
That's what I'd like to know.
R.H. Right hand.
Avani?
Don't look around. We're being watched.
Cops?
Listen up. I'm only going to say this once.
The location's changed. The new score is in Indianapolis.
I'm from Flatbush. I don't know anything about Iowa.
Indiana.
Same thing.
I wrote down the locations, the security codes, the whole deal.
Hey this ain't kosher.
I need to call Trinnie.
You do that and you lose this.
You get another package just like it when the job is finished.
Target?
That's my business.
I'm gonna meet you in four days at the Hotel Argyle in New York.
I've reserved a room in your name.
What's to keep me from walking away with the whole thing?
You do that and I'm gonna hunt you down like I did Martinez.
Then they'll be calling you ˇ°No Handsˇ±.
That's cold.
Your attention please.
-Announcing the immediate departure of the Indiana Star.
-That's your ride.
I want you to leave this at the job.
What is it?
It's a Hallmark card.
Always send the very best.
Leave it.
My tools are in there.
Buy new ones.
Because every cop along the line is looking for a man
with a bum arm carrying a black leather bag.
I'll take the bag and the heat.
How are you going to do that?
See you in New York.
See you in New York. See you in New York.
Your attention please.
Will Mr Paul Johnson, please meet your party . . .
Mr Cross.
Call me R.H.
Why wasn't I informed about Omaha?
No, no, no. Switch those masks, please.
With due respect Miss Parker,
it's not my job to inform you of Jarod's whereabouts.
It's your job to inform me.
-According to your file . . .
-My file?
Correct.
According to your file you've had Jarod trapped
in Las Vegas, Chicago, Washington and Florida.
It seems you've had ample opportunity to bring him back.
How would you like me to feed you my file.
There's no reason to be defensive about your shortcomings Miss Parker.
Moving in?
Possession is nine-tenths.
Now if you'll excuse us we have a meeting to attend.
Oh, any progress locating your missing father?
Who says he's missing?
A man packs his belongings and vanishes it's a logical assumption.
You gave that paper weight to your father when you were a little girl.
I thought he threw it away.
I'm sure he's fine.
He would never just leave without saying goodbye, would he?
You're dead and the rest of us are in handcuffs.
Twenty minutes.
That's all the time we got before security guard makes his run.
You're going to have to work faster to bypass that second alarm.
I'm working as fast as I can.
There was a day when you could have done it in your sleep.
Remember those days Dewey?
Scooter was the best I ever saw.
Sixteen years old, picking combination locks down at the YMCA ¨C
stealing wallets and jock straps.
What did you do with all those jock straps?
You know, it was a long time ago, Nick.
I took you off the streets.
I treated you like you were my own son.
Yeah! And when the heat was on
you hang me out to spend seven years in a federal prison.
Forgive me if I don't shed a tear about how things used to be.
I think we should cut him loose.
This job is going to be difficult enough in a perfect world.
I don't need a guy with his head half in the game.
I know him.
You on the other hand are a question mark.
Should I call Trinnie and get another locksmith?
Nah!
Let's try it again.
Long night huh?
Yeah!
Let's pick this up tomorrow night at my place.
-You got a pen. I'll write down the address.
-Yeah.
Oh thanks.
Oh here. Eight one six Highland.
Eight one six Highland.
ˇ°To Dad, Love Seanˇ±. Is that your son?
My life.
He gave me this for father's day.
Come along Jarod.
Miss Parker just gave that man a present Sydney? Why?
It's father's day Jarod.
She gave her father a gift to show how much she loves him.
You want me to put this out on the net for you?
Oh yeah. I want to know who he is and where he comes from.
I bet my pension there's someone out there looking for this guy.
The part is still going to be the rent-a-cops
Oh I never thought I'd need this again.
What? Can't open a door you blow it off its hinges?
You never know what you might run into.
Sometimes looking dangerous is enough.
Sean, what are you doing here?
I live here.
No. No. You know what I mean.
You're supposed to be at Mrs Albertson's.
I went to the shop.
They said that you didn't show up today.
No I didn't.
Actually that was my fault.
I saw some of the furniture your father built
and I suggested we meet right away.
My name is Cross. RH Cross.
RH stands for Right Hand.
What's that stuff?
Oh well you never mind that stuff.
If your probation officer catches you skipping work
you're going to be in big trouble.
I don't want anything to happen to us.
Who's . . . . who's the father here.
Now I want you to go back to Mrs Albertson's house
and you stay there ˇ®til I pick you up.
-But . . .
-Just do what I say . . .
Wait, wait, wait. Sean. Hey. Listen.
I just . . . I just need you to cut me a little slack here.
Hey! I love you.
I love you too.
See you Right Hand.
Nice to meet you Sean.
So why are you doing this?
What?
Why are you doing this job?
You don't want to be doing it.
Which means that Avani is holding some sort of big hammer over your head.
Oh I never knew my parents.
Sean's mother passed away after he was born
and I was sent up a year later, you know.
They passed Sean around from family to family like I was.
But you got him back.
And I intend to keep him.
Sean needs his father forever.
Jarod.
You need to finish the last simulation.
I made this for you Sydney.
For me?
Do you like it?
No Jarod, I don't like it
and I don't want to ever see anything like it again.
Let's get to work.
We just received these from our satellite office in Indianapolis.
His name's RH Cross.
He's a safe cracker from New York.
And we should be interested because . . ?
According to the office Cross's take was nearly a quarter million dollars.
He also left this behind.
According to the red notebook
Cross was going to rendezvous with Jarod
at the Argyle Hotel in New York City.
Jarod would never leave such an obvious trail.
Cross screwed up and left that behind.
That's quite a reach.
According to the security on the ground in Indianapolis
Cross was nearly caught.
Bridget go to New York. Find Cross.
I still don't understand the significance of this.
Jarod's sending you two a message.
Which is?
You're going nowhere fast.
We got eighteen minutes until the security guard makes his round.
I don't like this.
That van followed us ever since we left the warehouse.
-The cop's have made us.
-If they have...
...then they're still following Dewey all over the city.
I've got every contingency covered.
Let's just do it.
How long?
Five minutes.
You've got three.
What the hell is that?
He's early.
Twenty minutes huh?
What is it?
The guard.
How long before you're in?
Two minutes.
Oh. What are you going to do?
I'm covering contingencies.
I'm in.
You stole an electronic key card?
It opens the federal diamond depository in Wilmington.
What are you talking about?
He's saying there is no money.
Just another job.
That's what this has been about since the very beginning. Right?
Twenty million dollars in raw uncut diamonds.
My source says that the stones will spend thirty-six hours in the vault before distribution.
We move on Monday before the offices open up
and anyone realises the access card is missing.
Our deal was one job.
I'm out.
I'm sorry to hear that Scottie.
Change your mind the door's always open.
Best laid plans huh?
I'll see you tomorrow.
Dewey, this is Nick.
Hey! You okay?
Oh, I'm fine. Good.
I guess this sort of thing happens when you deal with a piece of work like Avani.
What's wrong?
This is too easy.
-What is?
-This.
Nick would never let me walk out with this much on the line,
not unless . . .
You got a car?
Yeah, come on.
Sean. Sean.
Sean. Answer me.
The house is empty.
I'm really sorry Scottie
but there's no way I can let this opportunity slip away.
I need you.
Your Sean is safe.
How safe he stays is up to you.
Research five took it off the National Police Net.
Why would Jarod's picture be on a law enforcement scan?
Well according to the background data
he's suspected of being part of a robbery group here in the North East.
What did you say?
The initial scan was sent
by a detective Harold Evans of the Middletown PD
Middletown?
That's less than a hundred miles from here.
The question now is what is Jarod doing
associating with a group of street criminals.
Well actually this crew is slicker than that.
They have an MO of targeting high profile, high tech takedowns.
Such as?
Such as, um, payroll companies, security houses, mostly diamonds.
Run profiles on all the potential targets
within a five hundred mile radius of The Centre.
Everything this crew might be interested in
and I want everything you can find on this Detective Evans.
If he stole a Baby Ruth when he was six
I want to know how many nuts it had.
I've been going over the layout of the vault room.
I'm thinking we've got a better chance of blowing the inner doors.
Sounds right.
What do you think Scottie?
I want him back.
I'm here right?
That's what you wanted.
Now you give me back my boy.
Focus, for the kid's sake.
These doors are only reinforced steel so we should. . .
Where my son is. And I want to know right now.
You pull the trigger on me, you pull the trigger on Sean.
Scottie let him go.
Where's Sean? Where's my boy?
We finish this job you and Sean'll be back together again, I promise.
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun!
Anything happens to my boy,
you'll wish I'd killed you.
Never underestimate the father-son relationship.
Jarod, I told you, I can't accept this.
But I made it for you.
I'm not your father.
This card is meant for someone else.
Don't you love me Sydney?
We have work to do.
It smells like gin in here.
What the hell is this?
I don't have the time or inclination to banter with you detective
so I will get right to the point.
You got a name?
Let's just say that I'm the person who holds your pitiful little life in her hands.
Is that so?
You tell me.
Go ahead, open it.
Where'd you get these?
That's not important.
What is, is that multiple copies are in my possession.
Good.
You put this picture out on the police net.
So?
I want him.
Can't help you.
I want him!
Harold.
I'm sorry for both our sakes.
I think I know where they're gonna hit next.
Relax your prostate boys.
We've got Jarod nailed to the wall.
The blonde's gonna bust a G-String when she . . .
What?
Please continue.
And while you're at it, maybe you can explain this.
I spoke to RH Cross in New York.
He was sent to rob the Centre's office in Indianapolis
by a man matching Jarod's description.
We did try to warn you about that.
And how was Detective Evans?
You had me followed?
Yes I did.
And I want to know everything you know
and I want to know now.
Jarod's become part of a robbery crew.
Evans thinks their next target will be the Federal Diamond Depository in Wilmington.
I think we should blanket the area
and grab the whole bunch on the way in.
I disagree.
Oh what a surprise.
You have a better plan?
You've tried the open snare approach before.
Jarod's too smart to let us grab him on the outside.
You let him inside the vault,
lull him into a false sense of security and get him . . . clean.
Why don't we just mail him the diamonds and call it a day.
I know Jarod, the way he thinks.
Yet you still can't catch him.
Ladies! We follow Bridget's plan.
Mr Broots you'll be given complete control of the security system at the diamond depository.
You can do that?
suggest you visit the building
and begin implementing a total lockdown of the facility.
I don't believe this will work.
I think it's time to end this pursuit of Jarod once and for all.
You can do that?
Dewey got these photos of the Depository this morning
and the keycard will allow us to penetrate the outside security system.
Bodies on the ground?
Minimal.
I made the lock system this morning.
It's hard wired infra-red.
Can you beat it?
Yeah! I can beat it.
We have no problem then.
Oh no. Not now.
What did you say?
Ah Nothing.
You look a little shook up.
No. No I'm fine.
We're all set then.
Oh no.
The coloured areas represent access points at the depository.
When the grid is red the building is locked down.
When it's green obviously it's not.
My guess is that Jarod and his crew will disarm the video monitoring system as soon as they gain entry
but it won't matter though because I'm the only one with the password to the system.
Very impressive Mr Broots.
I'm confident that Mr Broots has covered all contingencies.
Are you confident Mr Broots?
Here we go!
Alright. They're inside.
Let's end this.
Not yet.
Not yet?
He's sitting there waiting for us . . .
And knowing that gives us the upper hand.
The advantage of surprise.
Your point?
We have him Mr Lyle.
Let's not make another mistake.
What is that? What're are you doing?
I could stop and could explain it to you
or I could just do it and get the hell out of here.
The choice is yours.
Jarod would never have walked in here without a plan to walk out.
We stay the course.
Look, you want to sit on your collective thumbs, fine.
I'm going to do my job.
I won't allow you to compromise this situation.
You're going to shoot me?
Done.
What happened?
Drill bit cracked.
-You got another one?
-Yeah in my bag.
-I'll get it.
-No. No No. I'll get it.
I know where it is.
Pull out the broken bit.
Make it fast.
Scottie, give me a hand over here will you?
Just one second. I'm nearly done.
Now.
Yeah! Sure.
Hey!
You open these doors.
I want Scottie's son brought back to him.
Open the doors.
What are you doing?
Maybe you don't understand English.
I want Sean released.
I know Dewey's got him so you call him
and you tell him to cut him loose.
You open the door or you die.
Go ahead.
Tell him Scottie.
Nick don't.
Shoot.
You see, sometimes looking dangerous is enough
and sometimes it's not.
Now call him!
Dial!
This is Nick.
Let the kid go.
Yes! Right now!
The phone?
Hm, hm, hm. You should have called Trinnie.
Scottie, you let me out of here.
You know, every night for ah, seven years
I thought about, you know, what you were doing.
And then when I get out,
finally get my life back,
you take my son?
Scottie that was business.
This is personal.
Let's get out of here.
Don't leave me here.
Scottie!
Scottie! Don't leave me here! Scottie!
Hey! I've got two on the move.
Jarod.
Give me my gun.
If you want Jarod, give me my gun.
Tell the sweeper teams to move.
Wait. What the hell is this?
All the access points in the building are unlocking.
One area's still secured? What's that?
Sean!
Sean. Sean!
Sean. Sean!
Scottie!
Sean.
Oh! Oh! Oh my God!
Like I was so scared, you know.
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
You're fine? You're fine?
Dad, don't make a big deal.
Oh! Oh!
Look, I hate to break this up
but don't you think you two should be hitting the road?
Here, take this with you.
Don't worry, it's money that was owed to me.
Ah, you know, I don't understand.
Consider it an early father's day present.
Good luck huh?
Thanks.
Good luck.
Sydney.
Hope your stay at the depository wasn't too unpleasant?
You made quite an impression on the new regime.
I hope this doesn't end up making things harder for you.
Well, I appreciate your concern but that's not why I called.
I've been thinking,
and I was wondering if you ever thought about
what it would have been like to have been my father?
That was never an option Jarod,
so I never allowed myself to even entertain such a notion.
Well thank you Sydney,
for your honesty anyway.
Previous scene on the pretender:
I tell you that all the weirdness around here is courtesy of Mr Skin Grafts himself.
- The place has been different ever sinceˇ­
- Since Raines was shot.
- I'm no marksman.
- I didn't even want to take a gun, remember?
If I'd shot sterno head he would be snoring through dirt right now
instead of filling bed-pans in The Centre's burn unit.
The Centre cut you out of the loop this time.
Good thing they sent a replacement.
-What are you talking about Jarod?
- I'm talking about the blonde.
Any progress locating your missing father?
Who says he's missing?
It's time to come home Jarod.
Take my hand.
I can't reach you Mum.
Try.
You can do it.
Mum!
Mum, don't go.
Mum, Mum
Don't go.
This is where Jarod spent most of his time
while he stayed with us.
In a tepee?
Yeah. But no, this is a sensory deprivation tank.
I'm surprised he'd get near one of these things again.
But Jarod enjoyed floating in the tank.
It gave him a taste of the freedom he so desperately craved.
Most people go in the tank for an hour at a time.
Jarod, Jarod would stay in for days at a time.
And then he'd come out and go around hugging everyone he saw.
I never experienced such a connection to another human being in my entire life.
Maybe if you showered once in a while the experience wouldn't be quite so unique.
Did Jarod leave anything behind?
He said to give you this.
Thank you.
I have a gun and I'll use it.
Cool!
Let's go find the wonder boy.
Living in a tepee, somebody help me.
Help! Someone please help me.
Help me, please.
Ah...
I'm coming.
Just hang on.
Jarod. Wait for the basket.
There's no time. This rope's not going to hold.
Roger, call the chopper now.
Ah...
Just hang on. More line.
Jarod what the hell are you doing? I said wait for the basket.
Sit tight. I've got you.
It's a great day to be alive.
There are pretends among us. Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be.
In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.
Then one day, the pretender ran away...
THE PRETENDER
Season 2
Episode 3
Over The Edge
The word from the hospital is your victim is going to be fine.
Well that's great news.
And the word around here is that you're a player.
You should have seen him.
Instant legend, man.
You'd better watch out Bobby. Looks like there's a new Spiderman in town.
Yeah well we'll see who has the web.
-Spider man?
- Yeah! Like in the comics.
Hey, guys. Look, interstate brochures from Denver. Looks like he's serious.
Are you thinking of transferring out?
Retiring. Denver is where my grandson is.
Come on you guys. This is a good thing.
Makes room for the young guys moving up.
Okay. Pack and stack. We're due at the tower in thirty.
Oh man.
This is the third drill this week.
Get used to it. When Bobby makes captain he'll drill us 24/7.
You've got that right.
Jarod, everybody kicks in.
It's SOP.
It's sort of a ritual.
Every time we come back safe from a run
we drop in a fiver for Chris.
- He's the guy who fell from the drill tower?
- Just come out of coma.
I thought the department insurance plan covered accidents.
It does cover accidents. But, ah...
Chris tried to kill himself.
Where have you guys been?
We've been to our own little corner of heaven.
Got you something.
Thanks.
You wouldn't believe what's going on around here.
I rarely do.
Any word on my father?
No. Noone knows where he is.
There's Princess Tryhard now.
We don't want to make accusations you can't prove.
Oh, Please. Sydney you know what do yourself a favour.
Take some steroids.
Ever since she and Mr Lyle showed up this whole place has gotten strange.
Well it's just about to get stranger. There he is?
That's the guy.
Oh God! They're coming this way.
Oh, Miss Parker. Sydney. Mr. Broots.
This is Dr Curtis.
He's consulting for Mr Lyle and me.
Nice to meet you.
I'm sure.
If he needs to speak with you
We'd appreciate it if you made yourself available.
Certainly.
Cheers. Shall we?
Dortor.
- Who is he?
- That's what I've been trying tell you.
He's some kind of criminal behaviourist.
They brought him here to find who shot Mr Raines.
Oh God this is bad, this is really, really bad.
Relax Broots.
They're looking for a shooter not a whiner.
Yeah well they're going to pin the shooting on someone
And the way I figure we're the ones walking around with the biggest targets on our backs.
If you're innocent you have nothing to worry about.
Sydney this is the Centre.
Maybe no one will miss you but I have a little daughter who loves her daddy.
We don't even know if he will want to talk to us.
Fat chance.
I hear Mr Raines is going to force everyone who was at the shooting to interview with this guy.
And I mean everyone.
Peachie.
Move it! Come on Jarod! Your victim's had time to take in a double feature.
Go, go, go, go...
-Move it!
-Two minutes...
-2'1'', 2'2'', 2'3'', 2'4'', 2'5'', 2'6''
-Move it, here now, hold the way
2'7'', not bad.
Not good either not for a simple up and over.
Hey, Keep it down over there.
I'm trying to think over here.
Oh God we woke up the monster.
Who's that?
He likes to be called Spenser.
All he does is complain about the noise and write poetry.
Don't get him going. You'll have to buy him something.
- Is this where Chris tried to kill himself?
Roger found him right here.
You know I thought Chris and I could tell each other everything.
I knew he was depressed but he never said anything about suicide.
Maybe it wasn't?
He left a note on his computer.
You know I saw this happen in Chicago.
This guy, he got really depressed about the job
All the pressure.
Nah! It wasn't the job. Chris loved Rescue.
Well if it wasn't the job maybe it was his family.
His mother left when he was really little. She just walked out.
After his dad died a couple of years ago Chris started looking for her.
-He didn't find her?
-No.
But he felt she was close by.
He ran personal ads in the paper, searched the net, did everything he could think of.
He probably thought he would never find her,
That he would always have that feeling of empty
I can't imagine what it would be like never knowing your mother.
"USAR Member Attempts Suicide at Training Facility"
"Mom, Please call me, Chris (509) 555-0154"
"Grace Welman Where are you? Call Chris (509) 555-0154"
Chris, Chris, You need to be calm.
Chris, Chris, You need to calm down.
Calm now. Please.
Calm now, Please! Chris
I'm sorry
This is a really bad time for visitors.
Chris, No. Come on, it's okay.
Chris, Chris. Calm down.
- Please could you come back later?
- It's not unusual
For a post coma to lose sense of time and location.
He's afraid.
He needs human contact. He needs to know that he's loved.
Are you a therapist?
I know what it's like to be isolated from people.
Jo-Ellen, come here.
Hold him.
Go ahead. He's still your friend. Hold him.
Chris, Chris, It's Jo-Ellen. Sh, Sh, it's alright.
It's okay, it's alright.
Let's go over this again
Because I want to get it straight.
He was a spider and a man.
No.
He was a high school student bitten by a radioactive spider.
That must hurt.
Then he developed spider powers.
He could climb up walls, shoot webs
And he had spider sense.
Which is?
I don't know. His head would tingle and stuff.
Oh well I wasn't aware that arachnids had heads that tingled.
I don't know from arachnids but Spiderman's did.
This is fascinating.
I'll read them all.
GRACE WELMAN WHERE ARE YOU? CALL CHRIS (509) 555-0154
Mrs Welman.
My name is Jarod.
I'm a friend of Chris.
Hi, You have the wrong person. My name's Carter.
I know it was before you were married.
- What do you want?
- It's not what I want
But what Chris wants.
He's been trying to find you.
Mrs. Welman, your son needs you.
I didn't ask to be needed
And I sure as well didn't ask to be found.
Mum. I love you.
I love you, Mum.
Mum, I love you.
Don't leave me mum.
Mum.
Mum, don't go!
Mum. mum, don't go!
Sydney.
Did your mother ever hug you?
Jarod.
It's important that you get in the tank.
What was it like to be hugged by your mother?
How does it feel?
That's not relevant.
Jarod the tank relaxes you. You can focus on the simulation.
I want to know what it's like to be hugged.
I've forgotten what it feels like.
Jarod, listen to me.
You will never have that experience.
Your mother is . . .
It will be best if you just forgot about her.
No. I'll never forget her. Never.
Jarod.
Dwelling on your family will only get in the way of your work.
Finding my family is my work, Sydney.
We're only trying to find out who had the capacity to shoot Mr Raines.
And I'm only here to help.
Look I realise this is a difficult position for you.
But it's just a waste of both of our times.
You never married did you?
You don't expect me to answer rhetorical questions?
No.
Tell me about your relationship with Jarod.
Why don't you tell me.
Alright.
I think he's taken the role of the son you never had.
What are your feelings for him?
You're doing so well. Don't stop now.
I think you love Jarod very much
I think you would almost do anything to protect him.
But I'm curious, off the record.
How do you live with yourself
Knowing that you abducted a child from his family?
I was not involved in Jarod's abduction.
But after it happened you did nothing about it.
You had no problem
No twinge of conscience
About robbing him of a chance to live a normal life?
I didn't have a choice.
Didn't you?
I had to do what I was told.
By whom?
The same person who tells you what to do.
Exactly.
So we both know that you hold Mr Raines personally
Responsible for the destruction of Jarod's life
And we also know that killing Raines
Would give you a deep sense of satisfaction. It's only human nature.
I abhor violence.
Well, but that doesn't mean
given a strong enough motivation,
that you wouldn't stoop to it.
I think we're done, Doctor.
Don't look so sad.
It's a comic book, man.
You know, comic, fun?
This Spider man, he's a fascinating superhero.
Yet beneath all these heroics he's lead a very sad life.
He never knew his parents, He feels responsible for his uncle's death
people are always trying to kill him.
Curse of the superhero. It's tragic really.
Peter Parker didn't have a real problem.
Now She-Hawk her life was tragic.
I'm glad you guys are here.
Check your speed scores.
The condemned move faster to the gallows.
Looks like we're going to be in for more drilling.
You've got that right
Now Jarod you work with Roger Saturday morning
Jo-Ellen you and Bobby hit the tower in the afternoon.
Let me switch with Jarod. I have plans for Saturday.
Change em. There's no one faster with the rope than Bobby
that's where you need improvement.
And just think, you can sleep in on Saturday and get some extra beauty sleep
not that you need it.
No I'm serious Captain. Let me switch.
I'm serious too. No.
Now come on we've got more sunshine to spread.
See you later.
What's Chris working with?
A bungie cord. It helps strengthen his muscles.
Very clever. A rubber band with hooks.
That's the concept.
What are his chances for recovery?
Too soon to say. But I'm an optimist.
He could regain a good portion of his cognitive and motor skills.
Has he been able to communicate anything about his fall?
No.
There has been some improvement with his
pre- and post- traumatic amnesia but still,
no indication that he has any memory of the accident.
There must have been some damage to his frontal lobe.
More than likely he never had time to encode the event into his long time memory.
You don't know about bungie cords
But you know about Deerling's theory on shock trauma.
I used to moonlight as a psychological re-constructionist.
And I read his file.
It says here that Chris landed on his back.
That's right.
The haematoma on his twelfth thoracic vertebrae would indicate
that he fell on something.
Paramedics didn't note it.
I would have expected his injuries to be more severe
a fall from four stories. It's usually fatal.
Were you a triage surgeon too?
Only until I became a rodeo clown.
No.
No. No...
Hey. I wanna hear something that
loud I'll stick a gun in my mouth.
Hey I'm sorry. I just fell off a building.
Hey, wait, Wait up. I want to talk to you for a second.
Don't you have anything better to do at 3am?
-It's 7am.
-Yup.
The noise pollution gets worse every day.
If you're so concerned about the noise
why don't you move into a shelter?
Hey, hey, A poet needs freedom to create.
This is freedom. haha...
-Wow
-Yeah
The only drawback is the noise.
It's forcing me toward Haiku.
Were you here writing your poetry the day that the man fell from the building?
Uh, Yeah. Yeah. You see
I was flowing a rhyme
when all of a sudden I heard somebody screaming "No No No Don't!"
kinda like you were doing. And then
and then Boom.
After a little while all hell broke loose.
Sirens, ambulances, cops.
I tell you my creativity was shot for the day.
I've seen the police report. There's no mention that you ever told the police what you heard.
No. No see, I didn't tell the cops. I told one of you rescue guys.
- Who?
- I do not know.
I mean, this guy, he, he came up
and he said sorry about the noise
Gave me twenty bucks and told me to get a hot meal.
and that, my friend, it's poetic.
What did he look like?
golden, gear and helmets and everything
all you guys look the same.
Hey, hey. You know what?
He had some sort of fancy money chip.
It had sort of like a, ah, a spider web design right in the middle.
Water melon, right?
Yeah. That's what we call them here on earth. Tonight's dessert.
Why are you banging them?
I'm not banging, I'm clumping.
How do you tell when watermelon's ripe?
I don't know. I've never eaten one.
Well Starman, you're definitely in for a treat. We're all chipping in
so you owe me five bucks.
Five bucks huh?
Actually I don't have any cash on me.
Come on man. Hey! Nobody gets out of paying.
What's the matter? Mummy didn't give you any lunch money today?
-Something like that. Can you cover me?
-Yeah.
- You will pay me back, right?
- Of course I will.
If we can't trust each other who can we trust?
Right.
I got word that you ah . . .
Come in.
Sit!
Cute kids.
I've been looking over your file.
There's a letter in here
from a Mrs Mosely.
What, my fourth grade teacher?
- How far back does that thing go?
- The letter is addressed to your mother.
Apparently Mrs Mosely was concerned for your safety at school.
Why was that?
You know how kids are, you know. They like to pick on the egg head.
Do you remember what it felt like to be picked on?
Yes I guess so,
when I think about it.
You're next.
So did you ever attempt to defend yourself against those bullies.
The bullies. No.
actually no, I learned how to outsmart them.
What about today?
How do you respond to people who pick on you today.
-No one bullies me
-Really
I was under the impression that Miss Parker often teased your task.
She likes to tease me. Friends do that.
Oh so you two are friends?
Well, ah no, wait a minute, not, ah,
not exactly.
Let's go.
How does Mr Raines treat you?
Mr. Raines.
Always Um has treated me fairly
with great respect.
That's very interesting
because it says in here that you have been overheard disparaging him on more than one occasion.
That's . . . that's a flat out lie.
Who said that? I would like to know who said that.
That would be ah Mr Raines.
It must eat you up knowing that people
have picked on you your whole life, and you've always had to take it,
never getting to even the score.
How long will you let people demean
and belittle you until you finally say
"enough, it ends here"
- How much humiliation can you take?
- I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to get inside my head
stir it up a bit
Well it's not going to work.
You, Let's go.
I want to stay here.
Hey, Hey you. Leave her alone!
What are they going to do with her.
What do you think they're going to do to her? Are they going to hurt her?
The way Mr Raines implied that he would do to your daughter.
Do you want to know the truth.
I'll give you the truth. If anyone was ever to hurt my daughter,
even tried to hurt my daughter I'd kill them.
I don't care who.
I'd kill them.
-Sydney
-How's the book?
I'm not sure how Judge Teale is going to wrap this one up.
How did you know?
You always used to sit down at your desk at eight p.m. with a good book.
- Does it still relax you??
- You know me too well.
I can hear birds in the background. It must still be light where you are.
You're getting very good at this.
I can also hear sadness in your voice.
I guess you know me too well.
I've been thinking about my mother lately.
What it's going to be like when we finally meet.
Go on.
How to say, It's just that we've been separated for so long.
Will she . . .
never mind.
Everyone wants to believe that their mother's love is absolute.
Sadly that's not always the case.
Did your mother love you?
Yes, I believe she did,
but know this. If the mother rejects her offspring
rarely does the blame fall upon the child.
It is usually an indication
that the woman does not love herself.
Thank you, Sydney.
Hey! I told you to leave me alone.
This will help when the methadone doesn't.
You were at the free clinic getting your daily dose
but methadone it doesn't stop the craving for heroin it only replaces it.
That's why you still keep getting the sweats. Your body is screaming for relief.
Are you a junkie?
No but I was a congressional adviser on drug policy for a while.
Scout's honour.
This is arginine root. It's an organic herb. It has a great calming affect.
Friends of mine, they harvest it in Oregon.
Trust me it works.
Oh, Damn it.
Is this Chris?
Yes when he was eleven years old.
His poppa sent it to me at a halfway house.
It's hard to be carrying around a picture of someone that you're trying to forget.
I'm not trying to forget. It would just be better if we don't see each other.
Is that why you went to the hospital?
I checked the sign in sheet at intensive care.
You didn't think people would recognise your maiden name.
They told me that Chris was in a coma. They didn't know if he was going to live or not.
I did what any mother would do. I went to see my son.
I didn't have the strength to open the door.
This is my mother.
I only remember seeing her once.
I don't know much about her
But I do know that I would give anything to feel her arms around me.
Listen if you're . . .
If you're gonna tell me that Chris needs me
and the past doesn't matter, save it.
I've always been a great addict but I'm worthless as a mother.
Grace you're a person with a disease.
A disease that controlled your life.
It kept you from the people that you love
but somewhere you found the courage to fight it.
Maybe if you look there again
you will find the way to make things right with your son.
Hey, Jo-Ellen.
Where is everybody?
Around somewhere.
Really.
It's funny because I only saw your car out there in the parking lot.
Yeah.
Please Bobby, I have work to do.
The Captain assignd that to you?
Yes! And he wants it done before he comes in.
I guess that means that when I make Captain you'll do exactly what I say.
Don't.
I don't like games.
you'll never guess what I just found.
Hey Jarod I didn't see your car outside.
I took the bus.
A seedless watermelon.
Now, I wonder how they get them out.
Yeah.
I've got some work I got to do.
I'll talk to you later.
If I'm tired you must be exhausted.
- Why?
- Well not only do you have to work
train all day like the rest of us
but you have to put up with him.
What you mean?
Looking over your shoulder.
Constant wondering when he'll show up.
What he'll want.
The rage,
the powerlessness.
I know that it would eat at me until I wanted to scream.
At first it seemed liked harmless flirting.
I thought I could handle it. Handle Bobby.
But he's so aggressive.
He scares me.
Being the only woman you must have felt trapped.
Well I knew that if I complained to the Commander I would get nothing but flak.
Bobby would only deny it and I would become the black sheep of the squad,
if I wasn't fired.
Believe me it's hard enough being one of the boys around here.
So I just kept my mouth shut.
And then Chris found out?
One night Bo . . . Bobby touched me
and I was upset. Chris comforted me.
He was such a great guy, you know.
As if dealing with his own problems wasn't enough he wanted to take care of me too.
He was really angry with Bobby.
He even wrote up a report but, you know, I couldn't sign it.
Well you should've.
You're not the first woman to feel this way.
Bobby's done this before,
in Portland.
He almost lost his job.
His wife nearly left him
but he intimidated the victim until she dropped the charges.
I don't know.
He's connected Jarod. Bobby's about to become Captain.
Even if I take him on, he'll win.
Don't be so sure.
Thank you for coming, Miss Pakrer
I realise this interview is unpleasant.
Just know that my intention is
to eliminate people as possible suspects not incriminate them.
Considering I'm on record as having threatened to shoot Raines,
I'm would think that I'm your number one suspect.
And I suppose we're having this meeting in my father's former office
because Raines thinks that it will unnerve me.
I'm not sure that I know what you mean.
My father has disappeared
and some Ralph Reed clone has replaced him.
Exactly what part of this is hard to grasp,
Doctor?
Let's move on.
Now you've known Jarod since you were a little girl.
What is your relationship with him now?
My relationship . . .
is to find him and bring him back . .
preferably alive but dead is becoming more acceptable.
So wouldn't it have bothered you if Mr Raines had shot Jarod?
Not at all.
Mind if I smoke?
You make no effort at all to conceal your hostility towards Mr Raines.
Is that because you felt
protected by your father?
I don't need Daddy to protect me from Scar man.
Would you care to expand on that?
I think he was involved in the death of my mother
and knows what happened to my father.
What makes you think that?
Woman's intuition.
So it is safe to say that it would give you great satisfaction to see him dead.
It would give me great satisfaction to perform his autopsy,
before he was dead.
Miss Parker. When you came in here I had no opinion one way or the other
as to your involvement in the shooting of Mr Raines.
However, you must admit your excessive candour . . .
If I'd shot you,
you son of a bitch,
you'd be dead.
Are we clear?
Hey Poet! Do you like watermelon?
-Yeah
-911
We've got a bridge worker stuck on a scaffold.
When are these morons going to learn?
Where is everybody?
- Just you and me.
- Let's do it!
Looks like a heart attack. I'm going over.
Not this time Spiderman. I'm in charge here.
I'm going over.
Okay. More line.
Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.
More line.
What are you doing?
I need more ropes.
Okay.
Are you crazy?
Just making sure that you're still high enough.
- For what?
- Your fall.
What the hell are you doing?
Yep. That'll work.
See you Bobby.
Jarod, Jarod. Ah...
What the hell are you doing?
What you did to Chris Welman
when he threatened to expose your sexual harassment of Jo-Ellen.
Hey what kind of sick joke is this?
Oh this is no joke Bobby.
At least I'm not laughing.
You don't know what you're talking about man.
You had to stop him. You had your promotion to lose.
No, man.
So you followed Chris Welman up to the training tower
and you cut his rappelling rope.
And then you made it look like he tried to commit suicide.
That's a lie man. The man left a note.
Which you wrote on his computer.
Now if it makes you feel any better
I'll write one on yours.
No, please
Look alright, alright. I cut his rope.
I did it. Right.
Now please, pull me back up out of here man.
No way!
Now that was poetic. Ha ha ha.
Wow!
It's about time Dr Curtis.
-Have you reached a conclusion?
-Yes
And your determination?
Any one of them could have done it.
Not very satisfying doctor.
I'm very sorry Mr Raines.
That is the only conclusion I can come to
based on my evaluations.
Get out!
Perhaps Mr Parker knows who pulled the trigger.
Wherever he is.
I did what you wanted.
I told them it could have been any one of them.
This is who I believe actually shot him.
So, we're even.
For now.
"USAR Staffer Held In Attempted to Murder Of Crew Member"
Is there any progress?
It seems to vary with his mood.
If we could a way of keeping his spirits up
there's a good chance Chris could regain as much as
eighty percent of his cognitive and motor skills.
Mum!
Mum, I love you mum.
I love you too Jarod.
Previously on the pretender
I guess your mother never told your about this place.
No.
She came here exactly the same every year.
She loved the spring.
You were in love with her, weren't you?
Yes. There's part of her she kept hidden.
Mr. Lyle shows up, your father disappears.
It's too coincidental to be just a coincidence.
what is it? Jarod.
I don't like to be watched.
So you're drawing with indicates.
Or would you like me to leave?
No, not you Sydney.
Them.
They record everything, don't they?
Everywhere I go.
Every thing I do, every word I say.
Shut them off, Sydney. Shut the cameras off.
I don't control them, Jarod.
-Just ignore them.
-But I can't.
Won't you understand?
I can feel them on all the time.
There's nothing I can do, Jarod.
It's not fair.
Turn them off.
-Jarod, no. Stop.
-Guys turn them off.
Okay, smile at the camera.
Alright, well done, kids.
Ooh
Where are those parents who don't need them.
Hey, how are you folks doing? You know we've got special going...Um...for extra copies for gramma, granppa?
Do I look like I drive a mini lamb
You know this man?
Yes, Sure. That's Jarod...adams. Yeah.
He worked here a couple of weeks.
Good guy, give me this.
Hard woman.
You know where he is now?
Nope. But he did tell me that someone would be by to pick this up.
Right here.
I'm someone.
This is Manhattan.
This is extortion.
Oh, come on. This is Manhattan.
Your parents must be very proud.
Excuse me.
Ah, this is a ... viewer
Oh view master with no reel.
Tragically some bought it.
Why tragically?
Because it means I'll be forced to listen to you attach some great set me out of meaning to that toy.
What I think the distress of your father's disappearance is starting to get to you.
The only thing getting to me is Jarod.
You should consider a vacation.
My help just said, am I?
So we put a bullet in Jarod.... But I can't do that now, can I?
Because I don't know where he is, do I?
Say cheese.
That's rap./Let's rest. Sounds great.
Hohoho, great gig.
She'll be shooting public
There are pretends among us. Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be.
In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.
Then one day, the pretender ran away...
THE PRETENDER
Season 2
Episode 4
Exposed
Too pasty.
Not pasty enough.
Get her a treater.
I didn't know shall I dig her.
Darrin, don't you think that's a little harsh?
Harsh? From an agent?
Brian, it's a modelling firm, not a halfway house form of a prom queen.
-Mr Faxon.
-Jarod.
Brian, I assumed you've seen Jarod.
Very impressive.
No. It's exceptional.
You've obviously worked the Marsks, Elvton, Payne, Newton...Their influence is unmistakable
Hey, you enjoyed the books quite a bit.
The books. Yes, it's very...
Your schedule of the shoot for Cindy Thomas portfolio at eleven thirty.
I haven't met her yet, but I heard she is...exceptional.
Uh, she is still very raw, but her potential is amazing.
And so far no photographer has captured the true look,
the illusive quality will make her the next of ... her.
Kimberly Green.
She died of a car accident, right?
That's the offcial version.
Was it something else?
A man was stalking Kimberly.
We think she drove in the river by accident.
There's no doubt in my mind he killed her.
Her body was never found.
Then they'll never catch the stalker.
Yeah, still out there somewhere.
Oh, Brian, I need you do uh...
I used to have the entire thunder birds collection on reels for this.
Thunder birds?
Yeah.
Oh it's like star wars only little talking puppy heads.
Kind of like your old birds?
Only raffles but the line was busy.
What's on the phone ... Thomas?
Your father's vacation home.
I spoke to his house boy, who for six years has spoke perfect English but today
When I asked if he see my father, he couldn't understand the damn word.
He will come back.
So?
Oh, ah, this package came for you.
For me, and, it's moving.
Jarod.
Oh, that is Mrs. Paul.
So much for your empty view master.
Here, you two bound.
Miss Parker.
Where's daddy?
He leaves toy mad me.
Don't be Jarod.
Mr. Lyle.
Miss Parker, I swear we had an appointment in my office thirty minute ago.
A ... met a rose. Unfortunately, it was a false lead on Jarod.
Um, it's too bad.
So we came ... again.
In New York, I believe.
He's already left his last locale when we arrived.
Any clue as where he may be going?
I saw nothing that could be interpreted in that manner.
How unfortunate!
Got it better.
I'm going out.
Anyone asks where I am,
lie.
You look great, Cindy.
Fantastic.
Ah, extraordinary.
Look, it's great.
Great.
Relax. Have fun.
Be kid.
But...It supposed to be sexy and provoketive.
We are selling you now, so be...you.
Okey, why not?
Say cheese.
Hey, ah, that's it.
That's what I want, you great.
You can go home now.
That was a little ridiculous, but that was a lot of fun, thank you.
Jarod, that black shot just maybe become around the next stage's catalog.
Exception, couldn't agree with Brian more.
I am curious that where the hell did you come up with that technic.
Happy Faces Photo Phun. Excuse me.
Hello?
Hey, excuse me, my name is Jarod.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
No...problem. I was just...working.
Um, a beautiful lady.
I bet people would pay money to see that.
Just, just ah...experimenting.
No flaws now.
But to me it's the flaws make the face interesting.
There are some photographer like youself inside.
I am a photo-enhancer.
But I thought I saw you taking pictures in studio.
Now I am used to having a camera..on me.
But lot of people may not feel that way.
I...told you I am...not a shooter.
Okey, it must be someone else like you.
Have a nice day, you, it was nice to meet you.
And I am telling you, Cindy.
Miami has the best donut.
Come on. Humid food and stun crabs. maybe, but donut?
I had my first donut when I was here.
It was a long story.
You are idiot. This is a great town.
Police just walk around just take everything in.
And what happened to Kimberly.
You two are friends?
As much as she let me. She is a pretty quiet person.
Won't close to anybody except her assistant.
I don't mean to blame but it's really tough to find any friends when you're suspicious of everybody.
Stalker.
He made her life a living hell.
He used to send her pictures of herself.
What kind of pictures?
Well, just doing everyday things, like reading a story, eating at restaurant.
You store at your mind of every one of them.
Once gets close of you touch with acid
All she has wanted to be is normal, you know.
I know the feeling.
Is someting wrong?
No.
Everything is fine.
Thank you for all help. I am really appreciated.
It's my pleasure.
Shut them off, Sydney. Shut the cameras off.
I don't control them Jarod.
-Just ignore them.
-But I can't.
Won't you understand?
I can feel them on all the time.
There's nothing I can do Jarod.
It's not fair.
''Fashion Model Escapes Stalker's Acid Attack''
''Super Model Dies in Tragic Accident''
It wasn't fair, was it? Kimberly.
Just wasn't fair.
What?
Little known fact.
Bob's make wonderful pets.
Yeah, it was great hanging string on through boilling water.
get point of one of these?
It's about your father.
I thought that point was clear.
If you know where my father you should tell me.
If you tell me where my parents are.
I don't know.
Find out.
This is not funny, Jarod.
Now you know how I feel.
Happy hunting. .....and to Gladys I say hello.
Gladys? Who is...
Good morning. May I help you? Would you...
Oh! Miss Parker.
Gladys.
Guilty.
Exactly what the hell am I doing here, Gladys?
Jarod said you would find this....very valuable.
It sent a middle value, I suppose.
I am old tears
You cann't chip here because you have two pieces missing.
Oh would you like a cup of tea?
you seem a little tense.
What the hell I suppose to do with this.....?
Jarod said a man you have lunch with tomorrow will be able to help.
What man?
Where?
Jarod said you know.
You would never know where the Chuck's Lobster House, would you?
All the women never know the exact motives of the person who stalked Kimberly Green,
I've identified several character traits
which all stalkers exist by getting into the stalker's head becoming a stalker
First of all most stalkers will believe the victim belongs to him, and him alone.
and attempting to control the victim's life through fear.
by controlling victim's actions with fear.
And manipulate her ability to interact with other people.
A fear achieved by ...avoiding face-to-face competitions.
It's what the victim can't see. That's the most terrified.
And, what may have happened in the case of Kimberly Green
the victim rejects the stalker's...attemps to control her life.
The stalker's no longer in control.
And can turn to else.
Zoe, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
We're done.
Thank you.
I've been on this issue before but never think it is like this.
-What you call it again?
-A simulation.
I needed to get inside the head of someone who's doing some pretty horrific things.
You did a great job, thank you.
Oh one question.
Why did you walk up to that police man?
The strange officer catches the stalker for me
That's a little out there.
I've started to feel kind of weird you know.
Oh I'm sorry to get too weird.
I didn't mean to scare you.
Yeah, well.
I saw the cop and I figured it was talk to you to feel a little nervous.
What
I don't usually remember my dreams but this...
ridiculous one was...uh...
I...I was sitting in some kind of bar, and
...was walking around, whenever.
And...I was trying to flirt with the bar tender...who was a woman.
All this time we're talking saying some...really clever things.
And, you know, I, I dream clever.
And then, she turns around.
And it's Miss Parker.
And now, I'm, I'm really turned on and
She reaches out and grabs me and poses me across the bar
and starts ...me on my brother.
Sorry interrupt your session.
A session? We're not having a session.
But I'm trying to get a beat on Miss Parker.
-Have either of you seen her?
-No.
Not since lunch.
Oh, no, ah, actually I think she said something about pursuing a lead on Jarod.
Really?
Yep.
Lunch in Maine?
Need trick.
Never call me when she returns,
From lunch.
How did he know about our sessions?
You think you're the part of the planter?
Sydney?
Wow!
Sorry!
I haven't seen you.
You have a good eye, not being a photographer?
Kind...kind of hobby.
It's...it's honest.
You captured her.
If the rest of these are like this, you should do the shooting work.
I couldn't do that, never.
What's wrong?
Cindy.
I found this on my...
He's up to me now.
Why?
Because he needs new target.
I want you to move in with me.
I'll hire private 24 hours security guard.
That can't make any difference if he wants to get me, he'll get me.
Just like he got Kimberly.
Welcome Chuck's Lobster House madam. May I help you?
Oh, Miss Parker.
Is there anyone in this ... doesn't know me?
Jarod's table is this right this way.
You've got a company.
Jarod's here.
I am afraid it's only me.
Ben?
Interesting thing, Jarod has set us up.
Well police explored super model Kimberly Green's death accidental.
Her sister Erika Green believes like many,
she was murderd by the stalker who have been harassing her for months.
Her sister Erika Green believes like many,
she was murderd by the stalker...
''Sister Mourns Super Model's Death''
My name is Jarod Adams.
I'm a photographer with the Darrin Faxon Agency.
I don't have anything to say you people.
The stalker's back.
He's up to one of your sister's friends, Cindy Thomas.
Come in.
It's not more difficult for missing family.
Kimberly wasn't the stalker's only victim.
I lost the only family I ever had.
When was this taken?
One of the fast homes we were in.
We had a strange childhood that I didn't understand.
Oh...I might.
We growed up in the system, went from one fast home to another.
You never knew what kind of situation you were walking into.
But in my word, Kimberly would never let anyone hurt us.
Yes.
Look, this is the fourth time I told you people I am not switching.
I tell you what, why don't you give me your home number and I call you back.
I don't think so.
I can't stand....
I know what you mean.
I think I would like your sister.
She strikes means of survival.
She was.
There was the only one thing she couldn't handle.
Feeling trapped.
My whole life, but the stalk.
One for the other. A way out was all she could think about.
I am sure it was on her mind when the car went off the bridge.
At least now she is at peace.
''The river was dredged, the body was never found. Search party was called off 23 hours later.''
561, information.
561?
Yes, ....town of Florida. May I help you?
Thank you.
It's the only information I need.
I wonder that you want a long distance business, Erika.
Jarod, Jarod.
Jarod. Are you ok?
Yeah, I'm alright.
Don't have to do that again, Jarod.
I thought you were dead.
I thought if I pretended to be dead, everyone would leave me alone.
You and me both, Kimberly.
You and me both.
-Another.
-Right away, Miss Parker.
Courtesy of Jarod, I think I have finally reached the end of my rope.
Afraid, am I that.
I haven't seen this in years.
Was it yours?
No. It was your mother's.
Jarod stayed with me a few month ago.
It started to make sense by now.
What is?
It was pre-occupation with your mother.
And, this....
He told me the next time you and I met, to give it to you.
I don't know why but,
I have been carrying it with me everywhere.
She is a dancer in there.
I am afraid it doesn't work without the other figurine.
I am sorry I don't know where it is.
I thought this was lost.
But Jarod found it...in an antique along with other items belong to your mother.
She bought it one day when we were togther.
It always reminded me of her delicated beauty,
her graceful dancer skate.
My mother was a dancer?
A great one.
She never told you?
I am learning that there are a lot of things she never told me.
But it is a ... lesson I took as child.
Do you still dance?
No I stop...
She stopped too.
After she met your father.
Ben, do you know where my father is?
He is missing.
And Jarod led me here and hoped that I would find him.
I'm sorry. I don't know about your father.
Only your mother.
So, It's gonna been taken any time?
You know that it wasn't.
Erika I know you speaks to your sister every night at ten thirty.
I am not the stalker.
And you're expecting me to just believe that?
I know where Kimberly is.
If I was the stalker, if I wanted to invade her privacy, I would be doing that instead of standing here talking to you,
the one person that can help her to trust me.
I understand how she feels.
No one could understand that.
I do.
I told you, Jarod. You are safe here.
They are not watching you.
This is the only camera in the office.
I took it down this morning.
Remember, it's only a special favor to you.
I have to put it back in a few minutes.
So we can talk?
Just you and me?
You can do anything you like.
What is it, Jarod?
There's something in the clock.
Right here in the middle.
You said they were not watching.
Jarod, believe me I didn't know.
You said I would be safe here, you promised.
Jarod.
Damn you.
After he attacked, making my death was my way out.
Out of one trap into another.
It's ...living nightmare just happen now.
What is it about?
Always the same thing.
His eyes.
The night he attacked, I felt his eyes on me all day long.
As I approached my building, I turned.
And he was standing there,
wearing a ski-mask,
hiding his face, and he tried to put acid on mine.
The only thing I registered was eyes.
Tell me about it.
They were cold,
had no feeling.
Was there any place that you felt safe?
Home.
And the Agency.
But you know at the end I thought I was being watched even there.
I think I was just being paranoea.
I don't think so.
The public doesn't know who Cindy Thomas is.
But the stalker does.
You think he's access to the Agency?
I don't know.
But I need your help to find out.
I need you to help me find those eyes.
No, Jarod.
It's the only way out of this trap.
Trust me.
Together we will win.
The relationship between your mother and I
last almost fifteen years before she died.
I can still see her beautiful vision walking out the ...on the sunny day of April.
I was on the ladder when she called to me.
Her ... broken down.
And she tried to fix it herself.
Yes, she was covered in oil.
So did you help her with crack?
She helped me to the doctor,
I.. lost the ladder.
That's all she was, always helping others.
Even when she was in need.
Is that ..spring you two fell in love?
That's was the spring we became friends.
That's what we were for many years.
She would come up to the end of every April,
spend the first two weeks.
and that for thoses weeks of joy.
It may sound cony but this is simple thing she loved.
Gathering flowers on by the lake,
Watching the stars.
Catherine had a non-quenchable zest for life.
A sparkle, until,
She met my father?
Oh, at first she seemed happy,
but, year after year they sparkle faded.
But she kept coming to see you.
I was an oasis, the life she was trapped in.
She never told me about that life,
only her feelings.
I swear she was for me.
It was many years before our lips touched.
But I truely believe that we were met spend our lives each other.
We can only have what we had.
I hate, to know that she was so sad.
She was until you came along.
After you were born the sparkle returned.
You gave her the strength to remember who she was.
She was making big changes in her life.
Then she was gone.
God I miss her.
I do too.
Don't be sad.
She was never sad when she talked about you.
That is all she really ever wanted to talk about.
What's the other figurine that went in here?
Another dancer, a little girl.
Shame they can't dance together any more.
What are you ... doing here?
Your work.
It's excellent.
I can't believe you never show this to anybody.
I told you I couldn't do that.
Toby you have a gift.
It's like the camera speaks for you.
These are...beautiful people.
I am ...not...not one of them.
Beauty is more than appearance.
It's also about real emotion.
I looked your photographs especially the eyes of your subjects,
and I see a lot of that emotion.
What do you want?
Toby took these?
Everyone who was at the shoot.
Anything?
No.
Maybe wasn't there.
Maybe he changes his habits.
Stalkers always hunt their prey in the same way over and over again.
Who was there?
What's this?
Who's figure behind the back drop?
Oh, my God.
Brian.
Too..., no ...
Oh, please, send this one to...maybe you need new hand model.
Ah, this is just give me for you, Brian.
-Mr. Faxon, ..is going on the conference now.
-Oh, lovely.
Kimberly.
Hello Brian.
Kimberly.
Kimberly.
Kimberly.
Hey.
What's your problem?
My name is Zoe.
Oh...I am sorry I thought you...
What?
Hey!
Who's there?
You are trapped, Brian.
Now how is it feel?
-Over here, Biran.
-Kimberly.
-This way, Brian.
-Cindy.
You can't see us.
But we can see you.
Now we have all the power.
Who are you?
I am you, Brian.
I am weak. I am a coward.
I hide in shadows and watch.
Because creating fear and others is the only way that I have strength.
What do you want?
Are you feeling trapped?
Vulnerable? Terrified? Just like Kimberly and Cindy felt.
Are you afraid I am going to hurt you?
The worst part is you don't know how.
And you don't know when.
Then again that's what stalking is all about, isn't it?
Admit it, Biran.
They rejected you and that just tore you up inside.
I just wanted to be with them.
You want control.
And when you couldn't have your way with Kimberly, you stalked her.
And trapped her, and you tried to destroy her.
With acid.
Then you stalked Cindy in the very same way.
I just want Kimberly and Cindy to be mine.
Oh, well.
Now, you are mine.
Ah....
Will you relax, Brian?
It's just CO2 and water.
What's the matter, Brian?
Look like you're seeing the ghost.
I thought you, I thought you were...
No.
I am not.
I am not afraid any more either.
Relax.
Let your portfolio speak for yourself.
Don't worry. Darrin's going to love you.
I...I've never thought this day would come for me.
No matter what happens, I...thank you, Jarod.
I count that.
What?
Pretty, isn't it?
Pretty?
The music.
How is usual Jarod there is no music at the end of your games.
Oh, well. I am very sorry that you didn't have a nice trip.
But you have everything you need to find what you're looking for.
Why did you give me this, Jarod?
Oh Let just say: happy birthday, Miss Parker.
My birthday isn't until January third.
That's the point.
She would come up to the end of every April.
May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December
I have been looking all over for that.
Daddy?
How are you doing, Angel?
You poach him from my office?
You've been gone for over a month. Where have you been?
If I told you, I couldn't protect you.
Come along. Mr. Lyle and Mr. Raines want to meet with us.
But Daddy..
Just listen to your father.
Follow my lead.
Of course.
Previously on the pretender,
I think Angelo was a sponge,
someone can absorb the emotional and intellectual traits about others.
He can help us found Jarod.
You have a company now, Mr. Broots.
My name is Bridget.
I am going to do my job.
I won't allow you to compromise the situation.
A strange phenomena has occured with Jarod.
He woke this morning with seemingly no knowledge of his own identity.
We must begin, Jarod.
Why do you keep calling me that?
It's your name.
So you say!
I don't know even what I look like.
How is that make you feel?
I don't exist any more.
I want to know who I am.
No doubt,
the years of the pretender simulations has brought on this identity disorder.
My concern,
if that continues withdrawing, we'll lose grasp of his true self permanently.
He is gone.
What the hell is this?
It seems that Jarod is taking an interest in classical art.
Aphrodite never had a buck of milk like this, Sydney.
Ask me, I think Mr. Peabody is going to late puberty.
Why also would he be sculpting woman?
Dr. Clay.
There was every opinion I paid for them.
How did you become such an artist?
Practice makes perfect.
There are pretends among us. Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be.
In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.
Then one day, the pretender ran away...
THE PRETENDER
Season 2
Episode 5
Nip and Tuck
YTET PRESENTS
DICTATION: ±ż±ż/´Đ´Đ
Touch her face, tell me what you're feeling, Angelo.
Sadness.
Hurt.
Shame.
Who's hurt, Angelo?
Who's sadness and shame?
You're telling me that he cen feel the same emotions as when Jarod made these things.
He is still only beginning to understand.
Angelo's gift is an empath.
What he may be telling us what Jarod was pretending.
What the emotions arouse by the statues of the viewer.
Or the emotions of the worker who packaged the Clay Dough.
Hurt.
Sadness.
Shame.
A clue about my emotions, happiness isn't one of them.
Nice picture chuckles. How long did that take you?
My daughter Debbie drawed.
I wonder she could draw anything at all with all around this weekend.
Won't you ask what I'm talking about?
No.
Becuase if I have to hear one more time about your ex-wife and football team she's dating, I'll torse my toast.
It's not about my ex-wife.
What then?
How do I know I can trust you?
Um, I'm out here.
Someone is watching me.
This is the center.
Somebody is watching everybody.
No, no, no! Not in the center.
I had Debbie this weekend. Everywhere we went, I thought we were being spied on.
At the iceream parlor, at the zoo, even at home.
Sit.
I am telling you, someone is after me.
Broots, do you have any tangible evidence of the stalker?
No, it's little things, you know, foot steps behind us,
rustling in the trees.
When we got home last night, the light was out.
I...I always leave it on.
So it's dim bulb in your house, Broots. We always know now.
Hurt.
Hurt.
Sadness.
It's a shame.
Shame?
The mamma plastic you did.
Beautiful young girl like that you only gave a thirty-six inch bust.
Mat.
Oh I had to build her the code.
Any more than that she'll top in an earthquake.
Top? That's funny.
You gentlemen's serving dessert yet.
Ready to exciser the defect.
Your're running late. I got a rhytidectomy scheduled at ten.
No offence, Ray. But don't you have a promotion to get it passed over for something?
Rhytidectomy, at ten.
He seems a little irritable.
He lost our round at Santa Barbara clinic and he has been aggressive ever since.
Do you want to close?
Um, actually I would like to watch your technic.
They say you leave a scarring and then any surgeon cannot close.
I leave none.
What's your secret?
Sew's your pattern, nerve's steel.
And I think my old man laughed when I joined the macrame club.
Who's laughing now?
Yes, Debbie, Daddy's fine.
Um, just, just busy.
I miss you too.
Listen, just stay with mummy a couple of more days,
And then you can come back, okay?
Good. And do me a favor, would you draw me another one of these wonderful pictures?
Yeah, I got it right here.
Um, I love it.
I love you too.
Okay, be good peanut. Bye.
Perfect alignment. Incision's barely ...
Nice assist.
Where did you say you trained?
Princeton med, postgraduate at Harvard.
And Clay Dough institute.
Clay Dough institute? That's funny too.
Well it isn't funny as ever see the picture I get.
I didn't become a plastic surgeon at Beverly Hills just sit at courtside and leek games.
Don't knock courtside. And trust me the money will flow.
When I'm treating a medicate patient.., L.A. is full of rich, vain people under a unrelenting sun.
It's gold.
I just brought a brand new Boxter.
Cash.
As far as the perks, do you remember the bikini girl on Hellraiser Two?
I am dating her.
In fact, I designed her butt.
Well, she must be twice as good as Hellraiser One girl.
You're not still bragging about the bimbo construction business, are you?
Dr. Brant.
Wade.
You must be Dr. Clay.
Christine Brant. ...staff.
It's nice to finally meet you.
You've trained ...facial trauma and the sculped fracture repair.
Of course.
Great. We got a NVA victim coming in with massive facial injuries. She's yours.
I am on my way.
And it's very nice...
Time is money, doctor.
Right.
Lose something, love?
I am sure it'll turn up somewhere.
Relax, Mr. Broots.
I am here to help.
With you Peeping Tom problem.
How did you know?
Not important.
What is, is that I believe you.
Questions?
Why your friends Parker and Sydney don't?
Oh, they, they don't believe me, just they, they...
They could possible think a man of your intelligence a fool.
Or is that they have something to hide?
We know how to treat a man of your caliber.
We can protect you.
Who's we?
The people you can trust.
Hope you find what you're looking for.
Afraid, Daddy afraid.
Daddy afraid.
That's one big ear, Jarod.
You weren't kidding, were you?
It's a remarkable substance, Clay Dough.
And the name would ... was for cooking.
But I find it useful in training for blepharoplasty.
Otoplasty ... surgery.
You my friend, need some serious nugget.
Nugget? Is that another Clay Dough product?
Not exactly.
Any complications on the NVA case?
Um, no. But I will keep my eye on until they folllow up.
It's a candy case. There is no follow up.
Candy cases are pro bono.
They should happy to get surgery at all.
Pro bono?
I spent seven years in medical school to operate for free.
Once a week. Brant's rule.
You know I'm beginning to wonder about this place.
Money, movie stars, so far I've not even seen one single starlet.
For now you won't.
Brant does most of surgery herself.
And we get stuck with free bees?
This hole helped the poor a bit, it's Brant big thing.
Hey, yous. Dr. Eubanks, if you want to stay at Surgicare.
Dr. Brant.
Get something straight, doctor.
Surgicare is not just about getting actors a part in their next movie.
We are the county's top provider of free reconstructive surgery.
If you want to share the flora, you do your share the ladder.
Ah, nice ear.
I should sew a belt to her neck.
''Tragic Car Wreck Leaves One Injured, One Dead''
''Injured, Scholaship Student Drops Out of School''
''I Am...''
Why are you doing that, Jarod?
Why do you keep calling me that?
I am nobody.
You can't hide from youself forever.
Jarod's resistance continues.
If he refuses about anticipating any simulation to interact, even to eat.
The self-impose isolation is a new pretender phenomena.
I am worried about his future.
Can I help you?
Hello, I am Dr. Clay, from Surgicare.
I am on duty to follow up on Tricia.
Nobody's ever checked on that child before.
That's why I am here.
The friend of her was driving the car.
God rest his soul, went straight through the windshield.
I told Tricia everyday, she is lucky to be alive.
...she can't see in that way.
Cos of the face, she won't leave the house, won't see her friends.
That child has a voice set down from heaven.
Cause of she had full music scholarship.
She is never going to use it now.
Never is a long time.
I see you like music too.
Oh, no. That's Tricia's.
One of the mystery gifts.
They started to come in the mail, about one month after the accident.
No calls, no return address.
God bless him.
Cos it's about the only thing makes that baby girl happy.
Can I see her?
Tricia? You have a visitor.
Hi.
You like blues.
It's my favorite too.
I am Dr. Clay.
Jarod.
Can you fix my face?
I don't know.
It's going to be very difficult to see through that.
I don't want to do this.
Tricia.
It's okay.
You know when I was at your age,
I never left the house either.
I stayed in for about thirty years.
It's a long story.
When I, got out, I realised, what I was missing.
Trees, fresh air, sunlight.
Life is a gift.
Nothing is worth missing out on it.
That's nice to meet you.
Wait.
You have beautiful eyes.
What color? Are they blue?
Violet.
Violet, my new favorite color.
Hello?
Hello!
Who's there?
Hello?
An..Angelo?
Daddy, you're afraid.
I need your expert advice.
- Medicine or woman?
- Both actually.
This belongs to a super model.
Model or super model?
A super.
The fore two fracture of mandible.
Now do you think you can do the procedure without causing any problem paralysis?
Is the pope catholic?
I believe that's mandatory.
Look, in tht hands of a master,
she will come up looking better than she did before.
The 7th cranial nerve is near the center of the fracture.
Absolutely positive you can avoid it?
The most difficult part would be getting those complements in the lab
come up the negative blood A which I need.
A super model?
Is she, she seeing anyone?
I don't believe she is.
As a matter of fact. I would be glad to introduce you.
Dr. Eubanks, it's Tricia Holmes.
Hi.
Hi.
I remember you.
The fore two fracture of the mandible.
Just like the super model.
And I am sure you remember the result.
The posterior around this mandible was damaged and
right facial nerve's been suffering.
What happened?
Why don't you tell me?
Were you late for a movie premier?
Did you have a hard date?
Maybe with the charity cases you just don't give them.
I'm might not be... but I give my patients one hundred percent.
Right, except in follow up.
Guilty. But only following surgicare's pro bono policy.
Look, I am a damn good surgeon.
And I'm sure as hell never would I have done that.
Did you stabilize her fracture?
Completely.
And when you closed her, the nerve was intact?
Yes.
The lacerations that she sustained weren't that deep.
Jarod, I didn't do that to her.
I swear to you.
Well if you didn't do it,
Who did?
...closes it.
It certainly does.
Broots, one last question.
Have you considered counciling?
I'm telling you, if it wasn't for Angelo, I would be dead now.
He saved my life. He is a hero.
So monkey boy got out of the zoo.
Question is how?
Oh, I found this top security access card in its pocket.
Who knows how he got it.
At least, he saved you from whoever is after you.
Why just you still don't believe me? And what about these pictures?
Use them for your Christmas cards.
He is passed his bed time.
Put him back into his space.
Sydney, you still don't believe me either?
I am not sure what to believe, Broots.
I found these by the trinity of your house.
Shell casings.
It's the 9 mm, this is standard Center issue.
Um.
And these,
were with them.
Miss Parker is after me.
We will protect you, love.
But nothing comes for free.
Okay,
What do you want?
Miss Parker?
I want to know every move she makes,
everyone she speaks to.
You need this.
Oh, no. I don't know about that.
Survival of the fittest.
You know, choice is yours.
B...bless you.
Bless me!
Angelo, how did you get out?
Give me those. Give me that. That's mine.
It's my stuff.
It wasn't Miss Parker.
It Was Bridget.
What about the sneezy?
I've just passed through them all.
What are you doing with that?
Miss Parker.
Do you want me to hurt you?
No.
These were found outside of my house.
Your shell casings,
And your cigarette butts.
All planted by Bridget.
She is the one following me.
Angelo.
Who's access card, Angelo?
Amateurs!
Jarod, Jarod, where are you?
Jarod.
My God.
What are you doing?
Searching Sydney, for me.
Your name is Jarod.
And you have a tremendous gift to offer the world.
A gift that can help people.
You just need to believe in youself,
again.
I want to know what I look like.
I want to know who I am.
Ancient history.
That's me, in the drama club.
I got the breed in the screen musical Grease.
I don't think they wore leather jacket in ancient Greece?
Oh, that's me in the choir.
Let me guess, soprano soloist?
Um.
Was there anything you didn't do?
Um, maybe football team.
That you can't wait to get back to school to start all your activities.
Who is going to see a performer looks like this?
Unless she can fix me,
I am dead with school.
Tricia,
I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.
The nerve damage is irreparable.
What did I do?
What did I do to deserve this?
You don't know what it's like being left out.
Knowing people point you like you are a freak?
I know what it's like to be at the outside.
And I know that I am stronger because of it.
I don't want to be stronger. I just want to be who I am.
I just, want to be who I am again.
She is gone.
Forever.
Her gift isn't.
I look around your room and I see all the things your passionate about
and I know that your face is just a small part of who you are.
Only you hold the key to your future.
I know that the life is a weird journey.
But to live it,
you have to be out there.
Hello, doctor.
How is my baby?
Making progress. I hope.
This arrived.
Oh, could you open that please?
My arthritis is just not getting me down today.
All gifts from the mystery friend.
Tess, did all the gifts have the same postmark?
All from the Santa Barbara.
- Mr. Hoffman.
- Dr. Clay.
I am sorry about the urgency of this meeting.
But Dr. Brant was avid that this will be dealt immediately.
Well, You know your phone call was a little vague.
Is there a problem?
Someone has the information about Tricia Holmes.
I am not here to pass the blame or to play games.
Dr. Brant wants you clear that if you don't cooperate,
all this can go away.
I don't remember every patients.
It is a good answer,
for the medical board.
Medical board?
Um, they're starting an investigation.
I didn't tell anyone I swear.
We need a statement that you signed nothing unusual that night.
That will give the board off our backs.
And Tricia Holmes,
She can go back and hide her disfigured face in the shadows,
while you and Dr. Brant enjoy all of these.
Do we have a deal?
No.
No?
I won't lie for her any more.
It's two a.m. when Tricia Holmes was brought back ...
Dr. Eubanks... did an excellent job on her.
She was resting in calm. Everything was calm.
Then Dr. Brant came in.
She was freaked.
She was in the middle of chin implant on some movie star,
and the bone grafts needed for the procedure had been damaged.
Brant needed a donor, she needed one quick.
She checked out Tricia's chart.
Without a blinking, she grabed the scalpel.
My God, she didn't even bring that poor girl back in the surgery.
She reopened Tricia's face
and she harvested the bone and put it into a movie star client.
In a haste, she severed Tricia's facial nerve.
Brant gave me the promotion to keep quiet.
I've been trapped, ever since.
Ask Tricia Holmes about feeling trapped.
Long day,Bridget.
You know they say: woman's working all that.
You looked tired.
But then I guess stalking can be tough on the young thing.
The late nights, the long hours.
You know you Americans have a whole other English.
Sorry love, don't follow.
Now that my father is back.
You'd never get approval.
So there must be independent move.
You shot Broots, did't you?
If I shot Broots, he would be dead.
Now scaring him was the intention.
So who ordered it?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Raines.
It's just his style.
It'll make sense to go after the weakest link.
It was a very tough code.
Get something straight.
Broots may be an idiot, but he is my idiot.
The only one who terrorizes him, it is me.
You put a gun on me, no big deal.
Cos I know you don't have the rocks to put the trigger,
but the next time you miss with one of my team,
I'll put a bullet right on your blonde bonnet.
They said you weren't a bitch.
They were being kind.
For what it worth,
I did shoot at Mr. Broots.
However I've never took the pictures.
What's the occasion, Jarod?
Oh, let's just say it's my little way of saying thank you
for giving me the best job that money can't buy.
Well, you are the best hire I've ever made.
No offence.
You've been rolling those charity cases at our record pace.
Give the rest of us opportunities to focus on other priorities.
Like weekends ...,
... the beachhouse renovations.
Guilty.
Are you okay, Christine?
Ah, just um...
I haven't, haven't eaten.
Oh, I think you had one too many
If Wade would be so kind to lent me his car,
I will give you a ride home.
A chauffeur, too?
I really did hire the right guy.
What kind of champagne was that?
A very special year.
If you're keeping the engine like that,
you gonna ruin it.
Eubanks says his car can do one hundred and forty.
Let's see if he's telling the truth.
Jarod, Jarod, Jarod!
Dr. Brant? Dr. Brant?
Can you hear me?
There's been a terrible accident.
Am I okay?
Just a liitle blood.
-Oh God.
-No, no, no.
Never mind that.
There is no deep trauma. It's only cosmetic.
My face?
Is it bad?
Don't worry. The damage isn't severe.
I can repair you.
Thank God.
There's been one slight complication, however.
Complication, what...
Oh, we have a high profile client to the next operating room.
A super model.
She had terrible reaction to a chemical peel.
She needs massive skin grafts.
Luckily, we have the perfect donor.
You.
Me?
I am not donating grafts.
It would ruin my face.
I am sorry.
But, there is no other way.
What, you are insane?
You cannot do that to me!
Sure I can.
Just like you did to Tricia Holmes.
Look on the bright side.
At least I am going tell you that I'm going to harvest
part of your body for someone else.
That was what you did to her, isn't it?
Jarod, please.
You cut a piece of her jaw,
to save your important client's little chin implant.
And you severed her facial nerve in your haste, didn't you?
Yes,I did that!
Now please let me go!
Sorry.
I cannot do that.
But I promise, I'll try to be more careful with you, than you were with her.
No, no, no, Jarod, please.
Oh, try not panic.
Your face is still anaesthetized.
What's left of it.
You are insane.
No, I resent that, doctor.
I did the very best I could,
considering I am not really a plastic surgeon.
What a...
No, no.
Oops.
''Doctor Arrested In Cosmetic Surgery Malpractice''
I don't think she is coming.
You need to have more faith.
Oh, baby.
You look beautiful.
Thanks.
Can I give you a ride?
Thanks, but, life is a so weird journey.
and it's about time I get back out there.
Jarod, Jarod.
This is what you look like.
This is who you are.
Bridget did the shooting, but she is not the photographer.
We know. This is came this morning.
What the hell is going on here?
Someone is trying to terrorize us.
Who?
Well, we are working on that one.
Angelo?
Angry.
Feel confused.
Angry.
Angelo.
Who is angry? Who?
Angelo.
This is a waste of time.
I decide who lives or dies.
I decide who lives or dies.
I decide who lives or dies.

Previously on The Pretender
Broots is in the middle of the custody battle
The PI(Private Investigator) was trying to get something on his ex.
Thanks to you, my daughter has started crying since last night
Tomorrow I have to send her to her mother which is a place she doesn't want to go
Mr. Lyleˇ­freaky around more than Ed McMahon.
- Who is this guy?
- I don't know.
And that's what scares me.
- Hey, Jarod.
- Hey, Kevin.
Shall I get you as usual?
My mum thinks she's going to mad of me for getting another ice-cream man.
She said if anybody that would sell drug to the little kids, she would put him under to jail.
She doubts funny that's what you put on.
I was happy to help.
- Hey, what's that?
- A magic 8-ball.
- Magic?
- Shake it up
- Ask it a question, and it tells you the future.
-Really?
- Can I try?
- Go for it.
Will I ever find my family?
What did it say?
'' Better Not Tell You Now''
I am standing in front of the federal courthouse
and the aftermath would appear to be the well-executed abduction
of key murder witness Emma Barrett
Now eighteen mothes ago, Barrett, 37, witnessed the cold-bloody killing of her son, Max
and the innocent by-stander caught in the crossfire of the violent shootout
involving ruthless Yakuza crime boss Sammy Tanaka,
in what federal agents' describing as ''...chirurgicale type strike''
The van carrying Mrs Barrett to testify against Tanaka today
was the third vehicle in a heavily-armed motorcade.
The victim will be arriving
in the third vehicle of an heavily-armed motorcade.
Several witnesses here today say,
the scene was unbelievable like something out of a movie
Blue smokenades
were ... the both sides of plaza.
Coloured smokenades will be ...
here and here.
Why was this person kidnapped?
That's not important.
But I need you to continue the rescue plan.
Because the victim is located in the transport vehicle here
I would suggest at second and third scenario.
Automatic weapon ... behind the building over here
and a staged auto accident some where here
That will leave the transport van vulnerable to assault
The strike of the van today was followed by 2 other scenarios:
automatic gunfire around the courthouse ...
and the staged car accident all drawing the attention away
from the transport van containing the state's key witness
We do have two reported wounded at this point.
They are special agent Russell Gillson and the driver of the van
agent Jeffrey Edwards.
- A report on scene atˇ­
- lt's still false, Sydney.
In order for the rescue to succeed,
the van driver will have to die.
We've just received the information from the ... Hospital
that the van driver, agent Jeffrey Edwards, has died.
Edwards was 35 years old,
and a survived-by wife and two young sons.
The van driver will have to die.
Oh, My God!
The van driver will have to die.
What've I done?
I killed the man today, Sydney.
i killed him as I pull a trigger on myself.
- Jaord.
- Simulation 2578.
You told me it was a rescue scenario.
Then I see it's used in the killing of federal agent and the adbuction of the innocent woman.
- The Center is not in the abduction business.
- Tell It To Emma Barrett.
It is Lyle, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
I am talking about lies.
I am talking about how many people have died because of the way you use my simulations.
You used me.
Nobody's going to die any more.
If it's a war the Center wants, it's what you'll get.
But I promise you Emma Barrett will not be the next casualty.
There are pretends among us. Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be.
In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.
Then one day, the pretender ran away...

DICTATION: ±ż±ż/´Đ´Đ
Something on your mind?
We just received a phone call from Jarod.
A call to return himself, I hope.
He claimed that the Center's involved in the abduction of the key witness
who saw the 10-year-old son murdered.
- The killer?
- The Yakusa crime boss, Sammy Tanaka.
Sounds dangerous.
Jaord claims that the abduction was based on the simulation he created
just before he escaped the Center.
But I assured him the Center's not involved.
You may made a mistake.
Do not tell me the Center is now slamming with any criminal that...
Oh, it's not the same. Now Mr. Lyle is ˇ­ Mr. Lyle ...
Then Stop him.
We'll stop him.
Daddy, you helped to build this place,
you care about what it's doing for.
How can you just trun your back on that like it never existed?
It's just different then.
Maybe it's time for younger lion to roar.
Shot the life!Shot the life!
Series...
Staged auto weapons
Shot the life! Shot the life!
Automatic...weapon
I'm here! I'm here!
Colored Smokenades...
Leave the van ... vulnerable to attack
We've got Barrett!
Mr Darrell? Jessica Klein.
Call Me Jarod.
The DOJ(Department of Justice) of Washinton called, said you'd be coming in.
I didn't realized you will be so soon.
There's a lot of work to be done.
I know most of the attorneys in the D.C. Office. How long have you been assigned there?
Actually I just started today.
Stepped that right in the middle, didn't you?
It is said Sammy Tanaka and Yukuza has been all over it.
- You are presenting Emma Barrett?
-Yes.
Mrs. Barrett has been to so much.
The lost her son for over a year,
that woman is lived in fear and isolation.
and now, this.
Why is the case taken so long?
You've read the folder on Sammy Tanaka.
The DOJ has tried to... him for ten years.
And the hunchers of Washington will make sure they'll act together before this case sees inside a clue.
Would you like to question the agent involved?
Very much.
- What else can you tell me about the shooter?
- He was ...
White hair, about 35.
- What about the others?
- I didn't get a good look.
No, the eyebrows were thicker.
That's it.
Russell.
How are you feeling?
I am so sorry, Miss Klein.
Jarod, this is agent Russell Gillson.
Jarod is another lawyer form DOJ.
David Chase, agent of FBl.
Agent Chase, Agent Gillson.
I was wondering if I might ask you some questions about the Emma Barrett's abduction.
It all happened so fast so it's kind of blur.
You told the police there were 3 gunners.
Yes, sir. They were all carrying automatic weapons.
Asian make, I think.
Just wish I could go on for a few more roundsˇ­
- You were able to return fire?
- Yes, madam. But it was too late. By then Jeff...
Agent Edwards was shot.
The service teach you to touch yourself emotionly, but the truth is...
I will never forget the look on his face before he's dying.
Speaking of the devilˇ­
Tanaka's killed one true man at this time.
Let's go.
Well, thank you for your time.
Take care of your shoulder.
Yes, sir.
No, certainly the deal is progressing....
Yes, things continue this plan, the Center can expect a significant deposit in forty-eight hours.
Yes, I understand the delicate nature of this particular operation.
And I personally assure you successful, the deal.
Those vertical pieces of glass behind you are called doors.
Polite people knock before they open them.
Why is the Center doing business with drug dealers and murderers?
You have to be more specific.
Sammy Tanaka.
Why weren't we informed about the abduction of Emma Barrett?
I don't know that woman.
You are a liar.
Is he taking.... (doped)?
We know about your corruption of simulation 2578.
You two have been busy.
I decided to extend the Center's cope of operation.
The only I can discuss, security reasons.
Jarod will take the use of his simulation as a personal attack.
It sounds like a threat.
To involve Jarod as an accessory to murder and kidnapping,
that is asking for retribution ... what you can't even imagine.
I'll take a note of that advice, but
you don't have to knock when you leave.
Well, that was pretty terrible.
Don't complain it. You got what you want, you got the kid.
You gave me no choice, you know it.
I just want to know how you knew that I take your precious child support money went to Vegas.
I didn't.
Well, somebody knew and they told the judge. That's how come you won.
I don't think anybody won here.
You knew this would happen if you don't change your life style.
I don't care about this.
I am sad about Atlantic city.
Atlantic city?
Do you have any idea how much the bus fee to New Jersey cost?
There, don't gamble it all the way like you've done anything else in your life.
I don't do that any more.
What? What?
Here, in case you get hungry.
Gotta go.
Be a good kid.
Come on.
Everything will be alright. Come on.
The loss of a child.
I couldn't even imagine.
I doubt Tanaka is ...sleep ...the boy.
He is as ruthless and cold-blooded as ...I ever met.
According to Tanaka's file, he is being linked to over a dozen murders.
and he's never been convicted.
Men like Sammy Tanaka insulated themselves from the act.
They push buttons and people die.
Until Max Barrett and his mother stepped out from that pet shop.
What happened?
Tanaka was irritated.
He got across the drug deal by one of the Vietnam's heroin dealer.
A big mistake.
It doesn't sound very smart.
Sammy Tanaka may wear 5000 dollar suits and drives rolls-Royce.
But underneath it, he is still a ( little scoundrel of) Tokyo.
He called the guy in the sidewalk and opened fire.
An innocent boy's killed by Tanaka's bullet coming out of the wrong pet store the worng time.
Emma Barrett is only person to actually see Tanaka pull the trigger.
Do you still think she is dead?
She doesn't but the FBI does.
Bureau's decided to put all but the minimum number of agents off the Barrett's case.
Why?
Waste of time and manpower.
The woman was probably dead before she was ever taken out of that van.
Then where is her body?
Why take her at all with killing her as the objective?
It's been twenty-four hours. We haven't heard a word. I am sorry.
And once the victim has been isolated by the friendly forces, what then?
Well, that would depend on part of the remaining strength of kidnappers.
The best scenario would be to relocate the victim within one block radius near the initial assault.
And how long should the victim be held and checked?
24 hours.
Excuse me.
Late for something?
I hope not.
The rescued victim should be held in a low, profile structure.
One with clear front, rear and side access.
A low-income hotel would be adaptable.
Bring up the Barrett woman. We've followed in.
What are you doing? Where are you taking me?
Ah, no!
Wait! Wait!
Let him down! Go!
- This is Sydney.
- Emma Barrett is still alive.
I saw Center team transported her out the hotel less than a block from the original abduction.
You are positive?
They shelved her in a van and took off.
They nearly killed me.
There's nothing I can do.
...I heard about this, Jarod.
Then help me.
I need to know where the Center has taken her.
But Mr. Lyle has been very tight lipped.
What do you think ...with her?
The Center will hold her until they get the money.
After that her life is no value.
Please,Sydney.
There is enough blood on our hands already.
Excuse me for not getting up.
I want them off my back.
Them?
Miss Parker and Sydney.
They are asking questions.
Questions fed by information that can only be supplied by one man.
Jarod.
He was ...by a sweaper team last night.
What do respect, maybe you should re-exam the entire Tanaka scenario.
I assume the Triumvirate of this monitoring ... closely.
Don't tell me about the Triumvirate.
I am in control of the situation.
Barrett's been moved to a Center safehouse.
And I have a meeting with Tanaka's son in two hours to finalize this deal.
I don't want any more affairs.
You have my complete and total loyalty.
Have this placed on Miss Parker's desk.
The information is on it's way.
I hope she won't be a problem, you know our way.
You have my complete and total loyalty.
Thirteen months you sift and dig, preparing the case on the ground when the moment you found it comes up, blows up in your face.
What happened?
The judge refused to postpone the trial.
We still haven't located Barrett yet.
And I quote: if it's not the burden of the court to assure that you have a witness, this is the state's.
How long?
Trial is on tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.
Without Emma Barrett's testimony, a child's killer is going to get free.
I am sorry, Jarod, I am out of cards to play.
So, how do you like your new home? Pretty cool, ah?
Yeah. What's the smells then?
Smells?
That burnt toast.
That's, that's because I burnt dinner...
It's, I think it's the stove, that all stove, it's kind of...
And you know I put a swing thing at the back yard. and you still like a swing, don't you?
- I guess.
- Ah, honeyˇ­
Ah, Listen.
Be careful.
She is a beautiful little girl.
You must scare me heart-attack.
I did not want to be seen.
It appears your custody hearing won is your hope.
Oh, Yeah, it's a ... Oh, Listenˇ­
- Thanks for giving me the information that my ex-wife's gone to Las Vegas.
- What?
You didn't tell the judge?
But ... Um, What're you doing here?
I need your help to break into Lyle's personal file.
Mr. Lyle? You are not ... it's crazy!
A life for this ...
Mineˇ­ Sydney, I just ... I just brought my daughter home.
Can you imagine what they'd do to her if they caught me?
I'm sorry, but ... I cannot.
Congratulations on your daughter.
Thanks.
Look, I'm...
I am sorry.
Thanks.
-Ah...
- Hello,Mr. Broots.
Oh, my God!
Sydney.
- Is there something wrong?
- Um.
I forgot the number.
We have to talk.
I would like to discuss details of the exchange.
I'm sorry. The translator was supposed to be here 15 minites ago.
I am not accustomed to waiting, Mr. Lyle.
You want to know how an organization so powerful that can be run so inefficiently.
Hi, Tommy.
You are such a brilliant now.
You two know each other?
Tommy and me spent a ...
long, hot college summer together in Tokyo.
You did not change at all, Parker.
Say to this charlot that I want to regulate the exchange of this evening.
He wants to finish the details of tonight's exchange.
Once the ten million dollars transfered into the account of the Center,
I want to recover the parcel.
He says the ten million will be transfered online from his account
into the Center's, then he'll take with it the package.
I'm guessing Emma Barrett?
Tell him I'll personally oversee the transfer.
Our illustrious pin-head will be present in person.
My father has a saying:
''Never to trust a man
''who's nose is as brown as Mt. Fuji in the summer."
What?
He insists I'll be present at the exchange.
Fine. Fine, tell him that's fine.
I believe that his virility was insulted.
Tommy, What happened to you?
My father is a very exacting man when he does not have what he wants.
What happened to his hand?
The Yakusa was punished by taking a little finger of ''offending'' party.
What did the guy have to do to lose the thumb?
Good question.
See you tonight.
Do you realise it's dangerous for me?
And my daughter?
I think I understand dangerous, Mr. Broots.
I feel like I should ask you for your autograph or something.
I mean, don't you think it's strange that here we are, face to face?
Strange?
Strange like everything else associated with the Center.
I ... I still don't understand
how you could be responsible for what happened to, this, Emma Barrett, person?
They used one of my simulations to kidnap her
and they are trying to sell her to the man that murdered her son.
The Center is doing business with child killers?
i think they are keeping Mrs. Barrett in the Center safehouse.
I need to access Mr. Lyle's security records to find out where the house is.
I already told Sydney it's impossible.
Sydney? He asked for help with this?
Yeah.
But you see...
The thing is Lyle doesn't use computers.
He doesn't believe in them.
That's what scares me the most about this guy.
And anything this important, somebody has to physically get into his office.
Oh, no, oh... no no
You...you don't expect me to do that.
We all need help, Mr. Broots.
Help is the thing that the most important to us.
You sent the information about my ex-wife's gone to Las Vegus.
You'll be a good father.
A child cannot ask for more than that.
Jaord, I...it's...I...
It's too dangerous ˇ­ I ...
This is Max.
He was at same age as Debbie
when he was shot down in the street, in cold-blood.
Help me.
Jaord ...
It's cool air ... to my skin.
Why did you leave this information on my desk about Mr. Lyle's meeting with Tommy Tanaka?
You seem upset.
What do you want?
The same as you.
Normality return a better times.
A ten-digit access code.
Mr. Lyle will have one exactly the same, except for the final digit.
During the transfer of funds, you need to enter your code number
without being detected.
You are going to steal Lyle's money?
No, Miss Parker.
You are.
Hello.
The eagle has landed ...
Everything is ready, Mr. Lyle.
Mr. Tanaka enter his access code, once begin to move
and then you'll enter yours to receive it.
Let us just do this.
Not this illustrious pin-head.
- I understand you. I also doubt his competences.
- Yes.
Parker, I prefer that you slaps the code.
What's going on?
- Mr. Tanaka would feel more comfortable if somebody elses would enter the access code.
- Who?
Do it.
Transfer underway.
Now, I want my good.
Mr. Tanaka would like to take possession of his property now.
Bring the woman down.
Wait. wait.
The money is moving in and then out of the account.
What are you trying to fool?
- What the hell is going on? Who did this?
- Jarod.
Damn it.
Jarod's getting away!
Stop!
''Do not count on it''
Ten million dollars,
add that to the funds lost in Omaha,
Jarod has walked away with nearly 30 million dollars in the Center assets.
Not mentioned the 40 million he took during the wall Street transfer.
- Which he returned.
- Minus interest.
That's not the point.
Jarod's involvement in this situation has placed me in an extremely vulnerable position.
I warned you about the danger but involved I mean anything like this.
There is no way he can have known the location of the safehouse without the help of the inside.
That an accusation?
It's obviously the man like Jarod will settle for nothing last than complete justice.
I want every sweeper we have available on this case. Find Barrett.
- And if they cannot?
- Set the security seal around the federal courthouse.
Sammy Tanaka's trial resumes in the morning at ten o'clock.
Jarod will try to deliver Barrett then.
I've promised the Tanaka family he would not succeed.
This place isn't much, Mrs. Barrett
but I can protect you here.
You should eat something.
You don't trust me.
I understand.
But if I wanted to hurt you, I would not have ... to get you out of that house.
Then let me go.
It's not safe.
I know the man who took you.
They'll stop nothing to get you back.
- Sammy Tanaka.
- The man didn't work for Tanaka.
He's going to sell you to him.
How do I know you won't sell me?
You do not.
But he does.
All I remember is blue smokes filling the van
and the sound of gunfire.
Did you see agent Edwards before he was killed?
Yes, he was a good man.
I believe he had children.
Two sons.
Do you have a family, Mr. Darrell?
I was separated from my parents when I was very little.
I've been searching for them.
I hope you'll find them.
How many shots was agent Gillson able to get off before he was wounded?
Shots?
Yes, he said he was able to return fire before it was overpowered.
Oh, no, You must have misunderstood him.
Agent Gillson never inpose his weapon.
I just wish I could go on for a few more rounds ˇ­
- You were able to return fire?
- Yes, madamˇ­
Right.
I am done, Jarod.
What do you mean?
For over a year, I've been living in motel rooms.
Not even allowed to visit Max's grave.
My son is gone. Nothing is going to change that.
And now, a man is dead because he's trying to protect me.
A man with a wife and two children.
I don't want any more blood on my hands.
And what about your son?
Unless you stand up,
Unless you walk into that court room and point your finger at Sammy Tanaka,
then none of these matter.
Is that what you want?
You knew Jarod's going to be at the transfer tonight?
I was wondering the same about you.
Save it.
You've play me like a piano.
And I'm sick of the tone.
This is about Barrett and Lyle, isn't it?
The Triumvirate has .... of Mr. Lyle's leadership.
Like dealing with Sammy Tanaka, he has left the Center exposed.
You didn't dream this up all by yourself.
Who else is involved?
I am.
Let him go.
Please.
I apologized for the secrecies, but it was important that
you believe exactly what you believed.
And all the steps by the younger lion that was all part of it?
- For your own protection.
- The money?
Furthered it into a secondary Center account.
Proper time through the proper channel,
this information will be needed implicating Mr. Lyle in the fact
and the disappearance of Emma Barrett.
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
Now considering everything that happened, and did you trust me.
So if Sammy Tanaka and his psycho thinks that
Mr. Lyle stole their money and their witnessˇ­
It will be a very good time to be Mr. Lyle, will it?
My name is Russell Gillson.
I am currently a special agent working for the Department of Justice.
I was assigned this personal protection for one Emma Barrett.
Armed men made access to the armed-van
containing myself, Barrett, and agent Jeffrey Edwards.
I drew my weapon and fired several rounds in defence.
Fired several rounds in defence.
Fired
Fired
Fired
You are dead, agent Gillson.
Mrs Barrett?
Wake up. We have to be in court in a couple of hours.
Mrs. Barrett?
Emma, are you awake?
How did you know I'd come here?
Because this is where I would come if it was my child.
Max was such a funny little kid,
but timid, afraid.
There was a big dog lived in the apartment next door.
Everyday when Max come home from school,
this dog will start barking.
Deep, dangerous barking.
And Max, he will just stop at the end of the hallway,
wait for me to come and get him.
He was so afraid.
That's why I decided to buy him one of his own.
It was my fault we were coming out of the pet store.
You had no way. No one knew what was going to happen that day.
Max loved you and you loved him.
That's all you have to remember.
The court begins in less than two hours.
Do you really think Tanaka and those other people are going to just let me walk into that court?
It's a matter of fact.
I do.
Kevin? Hello, it is Jarod.
Yes, the ice-cream man.
I was wondering if you might do me a favor?
''Outlook Good''
I expected more securities.
Well, the FBl must think Barrett's already dead.
He has got less than ten minutes to get her on that witness stand.
Maybe we should lock the other way this time, Miss Parker?
We are talking about the killing of a child.
We are talking about Jarod.
This is Parker. Give me your status checked?
North access secured.
South access secured.
I want everyone on their toes. Jarod should be here in anyˇ­
What are you two doing here?
We heard the gunfire, we came overˇ­
This way! This way!
Miss Parker.
Son of a ...
- ''Don't Count On It''
- He's already inside! Let's go! Let's go!
Wait. Wait...
In the case the people voices Sammy Tanaka,
does the state wish call a witness?
Your Hornor, the state wishes your request delay.
Grounds?
I believe the court is very aware that the state key witness is unavailable for testimony at this time.
And I believe Mr. Klein, you have been not this dead in the street.
My ruling stands as posted.
Now, do you or do you not have a witness to call?
Your Honor, we do not.
If I plead this in the court,
I would like to present Emma Barrett as witness for the prosecution.
Nice to see you, Mrs Barrett.
It's nice to be here, Your Honor.
We'll take a five-minute resets since we are in the witness.
I would like to thank you, agent Gillson
for all your help in bringing Mr. Tanaka to justice.
I couldn't have done it without you.
I'm DOJ, and those people are wanted.
Arrest them.
There he is. Go!
Take him.
You've got to be kidding?
Let go of me.
Jarod. Jarod.
Did they captured Jarod?
- No.
- Damn it! At least we eliminated one problem.
I made it clear with Sammy Tanaka people that Mr. Lyle was not to be trusted.
It's a win-win situation.
We take down Lyle and take up ten million dollars.
Impossible.
- What is it?
- The account is empty.
The money's gone.
Ten million dollars.
It's going to help a lot of people.
I just want you to know I couldn't have done that without your help.
If you haven't transferred the funds through the Center's secondary account,
none of these would happen.
Thank you.
Oh, and...
Enjoy the gift.
Will you ever come home, Jarod?
''Better Not Tell You Now''
Yes, you are ... Perfectly.
I assure you that the stolen money is being tracked down as we speak.
I understand.
I promise...
I promise you we'll have no more trouble with Sammy Tanaka or his people.
Yes, sir.

DICTATION: ▒┐▒┐/┤ą┤ą
Tonight on ''Battle Zone''
a tragic story of a treason and a betrayal in Vietnam,
reported by Jordan Brock.
Toe Popper, a clock will turn
by pressure-activated land mines.
You step on one, you will hear a CLICK.
You step off, and it's the last sound you'll ever hear.
Army intelligent's just reeling from the discovery
that Private First Class Mark Clements
was selling classified information to the Viet Cong.
It was on this butt, on top one of these mines,
that Private Clements dark ... treason came to an end.
With discovery of top secret documents on his body,
Clements' platoon leader, Lieutenant Prentiss McLaren was a witness.
Mark Clements was like a brother.
I would lay down my life for him.
Then you find out he's a traitor.
What makes the man cross that line? I don't know.
He let everyone down.
Come here!
This is one of the local kid ... as a unit mascot.
He lives on the base. He saw the all.
Mark meet with Viet Cong.
I hear CLICK.
I hear explosion.
Mark was my friend.
I watch Mark dying.
This is Jordan Brock reporting.
Keep your eyes open, people! Anybody see them?
It's up there somewhere.
Keep moving!
Keep moving!
I had moved in this tree line!
Padia? Tree line.
I've got him.
Where are you?
Damn.
Where the hell are you?
I believe you dropped this, sir.
How did I drop and where did you learn the camouflage so well?
I had a lot of practice in ... , sir.
Fantastic!
watch the whole thing on the ... Those helmet cameras,
- What do you call them?
- Tactical Aniscopic Cameras. TACs.
What they are going to do for you which CNN did for Desert Storm.
Give us all the taste what it's like to be Rambo.
- Ram who?
- Cute!
And if the multiple TACs can document in a real incursion,
Capitole here will be bent over backwards to find you missions get in the clearing.
That's the idea.
I need some comparative analyses and figures for Congressman Stanfield
who've got to borrow in the property of the R&D funds
Well done!
You are a ... whistle.
Lieutenant Jarod Patton.
Master Sergent Rob Hancock, Staff Sergeant Elizabeth Padia.
Watch out for her. She looks nice. But she bites like a pit-ball.
And lieutenant, welcome to operation ''Dust-off''.
A joint mission with the Colombian military to infiltrate and destroy narcotics processing factories.
... cover the major shipping of coke ... on a ... factory in Cartagena
- owned by ...
- Esteban Largo.
You are all on alert so wear you pagers 24-7.
- Dad?
- Yeah.
- Am I supposed to be here?
- Oh, sure.
We are going to have great fun.
Look, here.
Come on, you sit down.
Right here.
You have Barbie. That's fun, huh?
You can color. So all you have to do is just sit here
and be really really quiet until it's time to go home.
And then, we'll have great fun.
Broots.
Ah. Or not.
Did I miss the memo on daycare?
The sitter has got the German Measles. Debbie's godmother is on a particular treat. I had no other choice.
It's called the Yellow Pages.
in for baby-sitter.
I would never leave my daughter alone to someone that I don't know.
I'm sorry.
but she's staying here with me.
That's ok with you.
Just make sure that miss murphy stays out of my way.
Broots.
Ah, Mr. Raines.
Yes, sir.
I love Miami.
Ok.
Right away.
Jarod has penetrated the data base of the Miami office.
Mr. Raines wants me to go down there and do a immediate mainframe inventory.
Sydney.
Could you help me out with Debbie?
Sorry, Broots. But I am supervising three sets of twins
...
Do not even think of about it.
Oh, come on. It is a day, maybe two days tops.
I don't do mummy.
No, I know Miss Parker. It might help you process on resolving child issues.
Never end with you dessert!
You owe me big.
I ... I owe you huge!
Thank you. Thank you.
Jell-O?
- And it is a dessert?
- Like you ... a lot in school, remember!
Actually my food was brought to me.
You did feed yourself, didn't you?
For the most part.
Oh, if the gelatine is soft, the pineapple chunks into the bottom.
But if it is too hard, they'll just lie there on top.
My guess will be have to wait for the proper viscosity to actually add the chunk.
- Is that the captain?
- Yeah.
That's him battled in Vietnam. His glory days.
You know what I miss the most about that war?
My hair.
Bravo Company.
(Who Nhon.)
Do you still keep in touch with the men?
One that still alive: Barney Stanfield.
Congressman Stanfield.
I used to bark a little ground around and now he's in charge of my appropriations!
If you don't mind, I took it deliberately writing down the comparative analysis report of the TAC systems
that Congressman Stanfield may have requested.
I compared four Japanese manufacturers with two Minnesota based companies.
Conclusions?
Buy American.
Padia! Bring this up to Capital ...
If you don't mind, captain?
I would like to take this to the Congressman myself.
I've never been that close to the real seed of power.
Just so we understant each other.
These are the house rules. No running, no playing.
No feet on the furniture.
And no noise, which includes both crying and whining.
Be invisible, we will get along just fine.
Your clothes is so pretty.
And no touching my stuff, especially my clothes.
What?
Hold on, Sydney.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing!
I told you to stay out of my things and I mean it.
Congressman Stanfield, I have the technical report from captain McClaren.
- How is this veteran?
- Still bald sir!
I like this guy.
I am...
Congressman Leon Beckwith, eleven district Louisiana.
You chaired the Vietnam memorial walls up committed that Congressman Stanfield sits on.
- You are registered to vote or some?
- No, Sir.
But I did help manipulated in Nixon lands line in 1972.
I really like you guy.
- Nice meeting you.
- You as well, sir.
May I help you to appreciate a good cigar?
Yes, sir!
- Santiago Caribe.
- Private reserve.
You got to know somebody to get to hold one of these.
Sir, Denise Clements is here again. Shall I call security?
Ah, no, no, no. Ah, send her in.
Is there a problem?
A tragedy!
And it won't go away, I'm afraid. Please, stay.
Sorry to show up without an appointment.
I have two daughters of myself, Denise.
I only hope that they love me half as much as you do your father.
Please sit down.
Congressman, I talked to a Corporal Ethington from a hundred and eighty-fifth who knew a man named Duke.
As you know, My father wrote a letter about a GI named Duke,
who was helping him to catch the traitor, not act this one.
So if it is the same Duke, I believehe he can help me clean my father's name.
Miss Clements, we've talked about this letter many times.
But it's circumstantial evidence regardless of what this Duke person has to say.
If you can bring him into the next-stop committee meeting,
I'll see to what you heard.
Thank you.
Her father served with you in Bravo Company?
Yes.
Mark Clements was the last man you would find who turned out to be a traitor.
She just won't let go what she wants to believe.
Someone once said that old soldiers never die.
They simply fade away.
But I don't think that the same can be said about the memory.
I think it grows stronger.
Who are you?
Someone who doesn't believe that your father was a traitor.
My name is Jarod.
This must be very difficult for you.
It's all that I've ever known.
Wasn't until after I buried my mother,
that I realised,
how important it was to get his name up there.
If I give up, there's just got the saying he's guilty, and I know he wasn't.
This is the last letter my father wrote home,
back in seventy-two.
' ' Duke found out one of our guys' selling secrets to Charlie.
If I find out who, God help him.''
So you think the real traitor discovered that your father was on to him,
framed him.
No one believes me.
I believe you.
I want you to tell me what's wrong with each of these pictures.
The chimney is missing there. The door is upside down there.
The bench is missing at post there. And, the address numbers are inverted there.
Look closely, Jarod.
The sun shadow of the wood stack,
It's mis-directed at all and I missed it.
Most people would, Jarod,
Their eyes can only see the obvious.
But to maximize your gift, your eyes must see everything.
Mark was my friend.
I watch Mark dying.
Mark dying.
I watch Mark dying.
Le Xuan Duc, Duke.
Hello, Duke.
Broots, what do you mean it's going to take longer than you thought?
Well, I'm trying...
Do you mind?
- How's Debbie?
- She's fine.
See, it's me that you should be worried about.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Mama, show me how to break my hair.
Did you get it?
We will open it after school, okay?
You have very pretty hair.
- Would you break mine like that?
I have things to do.
How did you get to be so mean?
I was born that way.
No, you weren't.
You wanna be rich? Of course you do!
And I am here to show you how to get rich quick.
With my new video, see this, how to get rich quick!
My name Lenny Duke.
I come to your country in tiny boat.
and now I own big boat!
American dream, number one!
End, cut it! Perfect, Lenny.
Let's lunch!
You know, I've got a table reserved over the woodbeach club. If you get to join me?
I don't think so.
Excuse me.
Mr. Duke? I am a really big fan of your work.
Um, 89.95 plus what brings you here. they'll put you on the road to the American Dream.
What a dream it is!
A young Vietnamese boy emigrating to American with nothing and building this empire.
Hey, as a matter of fact, you remind me this little boy I saw on this old news report.
About this GI and Vietnam.
who died as the legend traitor.
What was his name?
Oh, yes. Mark Clements?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Return to base.
Oh, sorry to bother you.
Have a nice day.
Operation '' Dust-Off''. You are two hours from your Colombian target. Good luck.
They have no idea we are in here.
Well, they are about to find out.
''Dust Off Tac''
Esteban Largo had to be furious of your handy work. Well done, Lieutenant.
I am proud to be involved, sir.
Hope again you can appreciate the fine cigars?
It is Santiago Caribe.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
About to show me on TV.
He's never giving me one of these special cigars, and I like cigars.
- What are you doing?
- Do you notice anything?
C-4 has a hell over kick!
There wasn't enough debris.
There was nothing inside that factory.
There's drums , burned powder,
lab equipment.
Yes.
But enough to process a hundred tons of coke paste?
What are you saying?
That's somebody tipped off Esteban Largo that we are coming.
He moves everything out,
and leaves just enough evidence behind,
so we think we make a big hit.
Who would do that?
With the destruction of this cocaine factory, another battle has been won in the war agaisnt drugs.
This is Captain McClaren, master man of the operation ''Dust-off''.
Santiago Caribe.
Private reserve.
You have to know somebody who gets the hold of these.
''Search For: Santiago Caribe Cigars''
''Search Results: Importacion Cartegena, S.A.''
''Primary Stock Holders''
''Search For: Importacion Cartegena, S.A.; Primary Stock Holders''
''Name: Esteban Largo''
Wow.
I guess he really do know somebody.
Alright, let's move this along. Next!
Private First Class Mark S. Clements.
As you've said, ... you have new line to share on this matter?
Yes, I do.
A corporal in the one hundred and eighty-fifth division ...
Sorry, Miss. You said?
It's about Duke, the man refers to my father's letter ...
This Duke, is he here to testify?
I wasn't able to find him, sir.
But my father was not a traitor.
If you would please listen?
Miss Clements, have you had the new line to share on this matter?
No, sir. But as I was saying if you can just give me a little bit more time ...
I'm sorry.
But you haven't let me explain!
Pushing!
Why won't you people listen to me?
Miss Clements. I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
but to be perfectly blunt,
your father's name will never go up on that wall.
Now, please. We have other matters to address.
You are giving up?
I am facing the facts.
Maybe I cannot find Duke because there is no Duke.
And maybe there isn't I cannot find any evidence on my father's defence.
because it doesn't exist..
And maybe it doesn't exist because my father was ...
When I was little,
I was taken from my family.
I do not know who they are.
Who my father is.
All I have is this.
It's the only connection that I have to him.
But I will never give up searching for him,
for my family.
Do not give up on your family.
I do not have the strength
to do this alone any more.
You are not alone.
I have been awake for over 90 hours.
Yeah, in the same room with you, that is a record.
Sydney, you got to help me out with this kid take off my hands.
Have a sim or something, I don't care.
- She's only a child.
- She doesn't listen!
She's always in my things.
I can't even take a step without a nipping at my heel.
She's like a chihuahua!
She says about her finding of your mother's gift.
Broots called.
He feels very concerned about his daughter's wellbeing.
Well,it's time he started showing a little concern about mine.
She do like in annoying me.
Debbie is not trying to annoy you,
she's trying to be like you.
She unconsciously senses that you both share a similarity of maternal abandonment.
Are you incapable of having a normal conversation?
It is her adaptive coping mechanism.
She senses how you came through it.
And it gives her hope that she too some day might come through it.
which is why you need to let this relationship flourish.
You know it would be really nice if once you can take my side on something.
It's not about sides, Parker. It's about the best interest of the child.
By projecting your anger on little Debbie,
you've displaced the anger with yourself as a little girl.
And why am I so angry about Dr. Spock?
It's that you feel responsible for your mother's death.
Leave me alone! Mum.
''Barney Stanfield Account Records''
''Prentiss McLaren Account Records''
Oh, remember, this is only infomercials
You want to be rich, you want big house, fast car?
Beautiful girls?
Of course you do!
I watch Mark dying.
Mark was my friend.
- My ...
- What the hell is going on?
I watch my friend dying. Mark was my friend. I watch ... my friend dying.
- Technical difficulties.
- Who the hell are you?
Someone who wants to know the truth.
Why did you corroborated the story?
- Did McClaren threaten to kill you or your family?
- you don't know what you're talking about.
I know ... Stanfield tipping off the drug lord about the raids and exchange for cash.
I figure if they are doing it now, they were doing it back then.
- You don't know what you asking me to do.
- I understand why you lied for him.
You were just a little boy.
McClaren offers you freedom from the ... of the war.
You back his story on national TV,
and he puts you and your family on a boat to the states.
It was ... a plane.
What?
McClaren helped my family escaped on a plane.
and I only said it's a boat on commercial for dramatic fact.
The war ended for you.
Help me end it for Denise Clements.
I was cleaning McClaren's tent.
and I saw some documents marked classified.
I knew something wasn't right so I told Mark.
He said he had to catch McClaren at the act of passing the documents to the enemy before he could accuse him for treason.
So that night, we followed McClaren into a clearing.
- It's north of the camp ...
- But it was a set-up.
McClaren knew that Clements was on to him
and wanted him to follow.
Because he had put land mines up there.
Clements hear the CLICK when he step on the Toe Popper?
Yes, I hear the CLICK.
But it wasn't mark step on the mine.
You?
Mark transferred his weight on the pressure fuse so I could move off.
- He took your place on the mine.
- That's when McClaren stepped out of the jungle.
He knew that Clements would never step off that mine.
So he shot him.
But he didn't die right away.
McClaren watched him bleeding to death.
And planted the classified documents on him,
made Clements like a traitor.
I can still hear the CLICK.
I feel the heat of the explosion.
You think the war is over?
It will never be over for me.
Excuse me, sir.
This just arrived from Congressman Stanfield's office.
''Cover Blown
Meet Me On Training Course ASAP''
Is everything alright, sir?
Ah.
Is everything alright, sir?
Ah.
Yeah, everything's fine.
I'm sorry. I can come back later.
No, come in.
Are you sure?
Sit here.
Just do something with your hair, ok?
I am sorry that I got angry before.
It's just ...
That present was giving to me by my mother and ...
no one has touched but me for a very very long time.
Why haven't you opened it?
I am not sure.
I wanted to do it about a thousand times.
But ...
it was so perfect ...
The paper that she used and the way she tied the ribbon,
it's very much of my mother.
Your mummy died, didn't she?
Yes.
The day she gave me that present.
I would not have opened it either.
Why?
Because if you did,
there will never be anything else for your mummy to give you.
I think it's time.
My mother loved this book.
She wanted to read it with me.
Little women.
What's it about?
A little girl named of Jo.
Is she happy?
Let's find out.
''Chapter One: Playing Pilgrims''
'''Christmas won't be Christmas without any present,' Grumbled Jo lying on the rug.''
'''So dreadful to be poor,' sighed Meg, looking ... down at her dress.''
'''I don't think it's fair for some girls have plenty of pretty things
and other girls have nothing at all.' Added little Amy with angel snuff.''
'''We've got father and mother and each other.' Said Beth contently by the conner.''
''The four young faces ... ''
''Jo says sadly:
''We haven't got father
''and shall not have him for a long time
''She didn't say perhaps never
''but each silently added thinking of father far away where the fighting was ...''
Barney?
Barney, where the hell are you?
Oh.
That's not a good sound.
Jarod, Oh, thank God! Am I glad to see you.
You don't look so good, captain?
I am standing on a land mine!
I'd better go and get someone who can disarm it.
How long can you stand there?
As long as it takes.
Well, I guess anyone could
if they knew what would happen after they step off it.
That must have been why you had shot Mark Clements after one that he was standing on.
And that's why I'm going to have to shoot you.
What the hell is going on here?
What really happened in Qi Nhon, captain?
If I were you, I would talk to me.
Or the next bullet might not be a blink.
Army in tower suspected a traitor on here.
So you killed Clements and then you framed him.
And tell head men you and Stanfield, you are in the clear.
We did what we had to do.
You'd got a business to run, selling secrets to the highest bidder.
Tell me something, captain.
Is greed so addictive that you can kill an innocent man?
You couldn't just kill him.
You had to destroy him.
You stripped him of his honor.
And you left his little girl another war to fight.
It's your word against mine.
Nobody doubted me before, you really think anybody is going to doubt me now?
Thanks to this helmet camera,
it is not just my words. It's yours too.
Game up. Lieutenant, you disarm this mine, now!
I am your commanding officer!
Not technically. You see, I am not really in the army.
But if it makes you feel any better,
I won't shoot you in the leg like you shot Clements.
I will aim ...
higher.
No.
No.
Do not wet your pants, sir.
It's jell-o. It's a dessert.
Yummy.
Hello.
What happened to you?
Well.
We went shopping.
Do you have a problem with that?
Honey?
Where did you get all these stuff? Moving Miss Parker, her business.
She is a good kid.
Always take care of her.
Or I will hunt you down and kill you?
Understand?
I ... I think so.
You read it all. Promise?
I promise.
Come on, kiddo.

Jesus, No, No, Danny, please, Danny...
How is he?
He is alive,thanks to you.
You should have been a paramedic.
He is still unconscious, but he is stable.
His family.
They seem like good people.
Why the hell the guy did this?
I don't know.
Is suicide the answer?
I set myself on fire because I am convinced it'll send a message, Sydney.
It'll stop the war.
We understand that.
But what are you feeling?
Stay with the simulation, Jarod.
But he had people who loved him.
How can he do that to them?
That's not significant to the simulation.
Family is important to anyone, Sydney.
What he is doing won't stop the war.
It'll just destroy the family.
Why would someone want to do this?
Jarod, suicide is not just an action.
It's a cry for help.
I hope that I can.
Questions remained about the deadly spill inside ECS(Environmental Containment Systems),
a private firm specialized in hazardous materials clean up.
We obtained exclusive fire department for it,
taking immediately after a container of deadly MZT foam ruptured during routine storage.
Three ECS workers were killed when the concentrated pesticide burned to their lung and paralyzed their nerve system.
ECS spokeperson Curt Wilkes.
ECS is engaged in a full and thorough investigation of this tragedy.
Our hearts go out to the family of those employees' ....
We called up the ECS engineer Dan Healy.
Not now. They were my friends.
- They were my friends.
- Yes, but are they dead because of you?
I tested the seals.
They were my friends. I let them down.

Dear Susan and Todd,
I have failed you as a husband and a father,
just as I failed my friends and co-workers.
I am sorry for the nightmare I made in your lives,
You deserve better.
Love, Dan.
Welcome to ECS, Jarod.
I read my orientation pack that the company ... seventy-five million dollar profit last year.
Yeah, and that Taiwan is a tanker we just pump three Belgian crew. Their shipping line is one of our biggest clients.
This is very interesting.
You process the waste with this system.
What comes out is highly concentrated.
And highly deadly.
We secure the waste,
we seal them in these level A containers and then we ship them off to some salt mine in Nevada,
where they won't give anybody any trouble for a while.
High grade polyethylene container.
Does it last about twenty thousand years?
Yeah, Dick Clark will be ... open it.
Funny, Strickland. Do you have any recommendations how we seal this ...?
It is highly combustible and highly toxic.
Since it's the level A container, I would suggest the double polymer neoprene and graphite seal.
That's right box, wrong ribbon.
We're going back to black end because a part of the seal with red one was Dan Healy's design.
It's no longer for use.
Because of the MZT accident.
Yeah.
Wear this.
As remembered.
And remindering.
Good morning, Miss Parker.
- Broots. - Sydney.
- You are lookingˇ­
refreshed.
New underpants will do that to you.
Sydney, you made it funny.
Startling, I'm afraid.
Last night I went on a date.
You had a date!
That's when two people actually meet instead of typing to each other on the computer keyboard.
So if it was a date, how can you be sure that those are your underpants?
Bernice and I went to this amusing little place, the Chocolate.
You, you went a comedy club?
New experiences keep my psychiatric skills ...
- Not to mention that ...
- Exactly!
How many psychiatrists does it take to change one light-bulb?
Oh, Wait... Oh...
Go ahead and tell us, ah, wait...
Wait, don't tell us.
Sydney, you are supposed to set the punch line...now.
Sydney?
I have the transfer report for you, Gibbs.
Forty-seven containers, almost a record.
Check this out.
Um, You are a funny guy,Strickland.
Got you!
Have a little respect, will you?
People died here a few weeks ago.
Easy, Hunsacker. They were my friends too.
Larry taught me that gig. He would thought that it was fine.
You eat that stuff?
They are very good.
Food of the Gods.
Dupont, right?
Yes, it is me.
M.l.T., Exxon Valdez, Kowet.
It takes a long time to build that kind of resume.
Actually, I typed it in four minutes.
That's funny!
I'm Curt wilkes, media relations.
Nice to meet you.
I just came down here to make clear no ECS's employee under any circumstances in the discuss of the MZT accident with the press.
That'll make it a mean of Dan Healy's suicide attemp.
I wonder how that happened?
Dan will have to say, when, if he regains his consciousness.
Don't give the status ... Got it?
Oh he doesn't want Dan here already. He is a conductor.
This is not good.
I want you to sweap the Center for Sydney, every corner and every room on every sublevel.
If he walked out, I want the sign-out sheet.
And Sam,be luky.
Yes, Miss Parker.
This is, this is really quat.
It's the Center, Broots.
People have the tendency to vanish.
Like Mr. Lyle.
- Have you ever seen he was like this before?
- once.
Really? Over what?
It was personal.
I hope he is okay.
Do you think, do you think he is okay?
You tell me!
Help, help!
Larry! Help me!
You saw them dying, didn't you?
It's like nothing I've ever seen.
They were hasting the container up on the truck.
First one just blew.
No one was wearing the protective gear.
For Hunsaker, said it'll deal out clear.
But the MZT took about twenty seconds to turn their insides into...
I heard the alarm, and I arrived there with Strickland
but the time we got in there
they have already eaten through them.
Never have a chance.
You know Dan was so careful. He worked on this for three years, tested and retested this.
Not against the MZT.
It doesn't make any sense.
Is that what you defend him from Wilkes?
Oh that snake only cares about corporate image.
You know Dan was debilitated.
He shouldn't go down for doing his job.
- He needs to see you.
- Mum, I can't.
Todd, Todd, please.
No, I am not going in there.
Excuse me.
I fixed it for him.
You were at the bus bench.
You helped Dan.
I didn't get the chance to thank you.
I am Jarod.
- Susan.
- Hi, Susan.
How is he doing?
The doctors won't know for a while.
He may never...
Is that your son?
Todd, right?
Yeah, Todd.
Dan talked about him.
He doesn't want to see his father.
I don't know why I'm bothering you with our problems.
Sometime it's nice to talk to someone who is not a reporter.
Everyday these vultures' asking did his father kill those people.
I think he started to believe it.
It is a very bad idea.
Mr. Raines finds out we get Angelo to help, he is going to ask questions.
Uncle Fester will never know the truth's missing.
How long do you think it's going to take to feel what Sydney was feeling?
That answered your question?
Jarod drew this. Who is he?
Le Morte. Who is Le Morte?
The one who brings death.
This is the ECS twenty-four pulling out now in the accident site eazing a tanker pouring indicator telling me it got a full load of triptochloronol.
- Jes, look at all the fumes!
- It got some of magicore leak ...
... to attempt onsite depressurization.
Anyone call the paramedic?
... a tank in the case of three thousand and rising fast.
This suckers is going to blow if we don't pump fast.
Update me.
It's already up to four thousand.
Come on, Hunsaker, lights on.
Are you okay?
My mum is in there.
Dupont, let the paramedics take care of them.
I am going to help your mum.
Gibs, get him out of here.
4750 and rising. Let's go.
Come on, lights on, Hunsaker!
Can you hear me?
You're going to be okay.
I am going to help you.
Are you suicidal?
Dupont, put that suit pack on.
She is pinning in the car. The fume is going to kill her.
If this tank goes up, we and half of ... are counted to your history.
5800! Come on, people.
Your son is okay.
Now breathe in this.
5300! 5500!
...
6300. Coming down! I've got to love this job.
One of our senior expertizers?
No, actually he's ... from upstate of New York.
His name is Martin Zeller.
Has a little office on main street.
He wrote up 253 eye-glass prescriptions last year and gives out little lemon lollipops.
Sydney fled to reflirt the barber?
Well, just before this was taken,
he was on this elevator.
The tower elevator.
So he is a probably a client.
Let me see Jarod's sketching again.
It's gone.
- Hi,Todd.
- No comment.
I am not a reporter.
Then what do you want?
I came here to tell you that I think father is innocent.
I guess that is why he jumped in front of a bus.
Now get out of my face.
I was with him on the bench.
You're the guy who saved his life?
I wish I could move faster.
Father didn't care about his life for ours.
Who ask you to?
Nothing.
Nineteen bottles of beer on the wall, nineteen bottles of beer.
If one of the bottles happen to fall, um.....
What's in that?
MZT.
Are you crazy?
Relax. Dan sealed this holding.
It is?
Yes.
And it has been for the last five hours.
The accident wasn't Dan's fault.
He didn't kill Larry Meyers.
If he didn't, who did?
Eighteen bottles beer on the wall, eighteen bottles of beer, um....
You have a new mail.
Is this the man?
No, no, no. The eyes are brown.
Watch yourself on the mind that police get to draw this.
Think.
But it will help if I know who he was.
Is he your father?
No.
Here, of the middle of the right eyebrow, were spot, an imperfection.
Yes.
That's it.
But his eyes,
Sydney.
Are you crying?
Of course not.
Did that man hurt you?
Sydney is in trouble, isn't he?
How is it that you know everything that's happening in this place?
Intuition.
We saw your little drawing of Martin Zeller.
Who is he?
I don't know exactly.
But I remember how sydney was feeling when I ran that simulation.
Who is he?
Sydney wants to tell you, he will.
Just to find out where the Center traveller offices put Zeller up.
Sydney will be there.
How do I know this is not one of your boom ..., Jarod?
If you care about Sydney at all, go alone.
No sweapers, no cleaners.
I just hope you get there in time.
In time for what?
To stop him.
Stop. You should be here twenty minutes ago. You are late.
You are right.
I am very late.
You don't remember me.
There are so many of us you can't remember the names.
I don't know what you are talking about.
You are a mad man.
You should hear every name.
But your time has run out.
At my age, time means nothing.
I believe this does.
Do it, if you will.
Frankly, I am tired of hiding.
No.
It is too easy.
You're willing to hear me out?
Yes? And then?
Thenˇ­ I will kill you.
Who won the fight?
Go to hell!
Guess you are defending him, your father that you said you don't care about.
Won conference three years in a row.
He's proud of you.
He told me.
When?
Just before he tried to kill himself?
All of he was thinking about was you and your mother.
He thought by killing himself he could stop the questions
and that he could ease the pressure on both of you.
I am not saying it's right.
But it's just what he was feeling.
An insect made out of medal and wire.
Fishing lure.
Like bait.
Yeah.
Dad makes this as a hobby.
This is my lucky one.
Got me a bite every time we went for a trial.
I saw a picture of you and your father fishing.
It looks like fun.
You know when fishing with your dad?
I wasn't lucky enough to know my father.
You know yours.
Take advantage of it.
What is it?
The night beforeˇ­
before he was on that bench with you,
we got a really bad fight and I said some stupid stuff.
I told him that the accident was his fault, I told him...
What did you say?
I told him that he didn't deserve to live.
I don't want him to die.
I don't want my father to die.

- Jarod!
- I wanted to give you a hand.
I even brought you a cup of coffee.
Not so fast, M.I.T.
You are not the only one with the chemistry degree.
Impressive.
Why someone with your seniority in your chemistry background still do a nasty job like transport?
- You can double your salary in research and development.
- Yeah, double my migraines. Here, pull over and I get to check on this one.
Got you!
It almost looks like an accident, doesn't it?
- These are release papers.
- Um.
So?
- You signed fifty-two containers.
- Yeah.
Only forty-two were buried in Nevada.
Where the other ten go?
Horace Strickland had them delivered to drug dealers.
Strickland had felony drug smuggling charge as in FBI record.
Heroin.
My guess he was smuggling them in the extra containers.
Who would examine the container label hazardous?
Strickland's bank account was getting pretty fat
minus few payments to Larry Meyers.
Meyers was in on this?
He was withdrawing money out of Strickland's,
threatening to blow Wilkes on the operation.
So on the day of the accident,
Strickland spike the MZT shippment.
So that would eat through Dan's new seal,
and eat through Larry Meyers.
It is him.
Who is he?
I received a package of my family's belonging today, Jarod.
It was lost for a very long time.
This picture is of my brother Jacob and myself.
Our first communion.
Is you twin?
Jacob is the only family I have.
I wish I had a family.
Jean-Michael lived with his family in a little farm.
It built near Lyon.
And his work only mattered to him so far as it held
his wife, Greta,
and his two sons.
Twins.
Sydney!
You do remember.
Jacob was your brother.
Very good, Herr Doktor.
And he is all the family I have left.
Because the rest,
you murdered because they were have no use to you.
Who are you to pass judgement?
Who?
This is for Jean-Michael.
And this is for Greta.
Sydney!
No!
Oh, my...
Who is Mr. Zeller?
There is no Zeller.
This is Dr. Krieg.
Dr. Werner Krieg.
The ambitious young physician assigned to Dachau in 1944.
The Nazis were testing us.
They were looking for ways,
to accelerate the reproduction of the master race.
Jacob and I became Krieg's favorite subjects.
We were only children.
He set our whole family to the gas chambers.
So that he could have us for his experiments.
Sydney, you are not Jewish.
I am a twin, remember?
Strickland? Big shippment is transported tonight.
Happy to help if you need me.
Oh I figured you want to be alone.
Je..., Jarod, you scared the winder on me.
Looks like we have one more item.
That's MZT. I don't have any gear on.
Neither did Larry Meyers, or the other two victims, did they, Horace?
That's not funny.
... by MZT.
Is it?
Got you!
Jarod, I can't move in here.
I would relax if I were you.
You're going to be in there for the next whole twenty thousand years.
Jarod, that's MZT!
Um.
The deadliest pesticide in the world.
Turns your inside to jelly.
But it won't corrode Dan Healy's seal, will it?
Yes, yes. I already did.
Of course.
Because you added this to it.
So you can get rid of your blackmailer Larry Meyers.
- and continue smuggling drugs.
- I didn't do anything!
You murdered three people.
You framed Dan Healy.
He was convinced that the only way that he could protect his family
was to leave his wife without a husband and his son without a father.
You destroyed his life, didn't you?
Didn't you? Didn't you? Didn't you?
Yes, yes. Now don't do this to me.
Why not?
You did it to them.
Jarod, Jarod...
Twinkie cream.
The food of the Gods.
Are you familiar with Nietzsche, doctor?
Um, yes.
You are like the mad man who runs into the market place.
screaming for God.
But he'll never find him because the God is dead.
God is dead, you killed him.
We are both professionals, doctor.
I know who you work for.
I know the work they do.
The work you do.
What do you think that would have happened to you and Jacob,
if I had not selected you?
Would you be here now, so full of purpose?
If God is dead, we all killed him.
Syndey.
Do you remember the dayˇ­
my mother was buried?
I will never forget that day.
You made me feel safe.
Safer than my own father.
And all you did,
was to hold my hand.
Give me your gun.
He is a monster.
Do yourself and the world, a favor.
I cannot.
Why?
Jarod.
Don't you see?
I became the monster.
''Deadly Spill Revealed as Murder''
It's the other day on the bench.
I realize now,
I did the wrong thing for all the wrong reasons.
The important thing is you are here, now.
Like someone once said,
Nothing is more important than family.
Dad?
I love you.
This will bring you luck too.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Take care, twinkie man.
I wish I had family.
What is that, Sydney?
On the war.
You were in a concentration camp?
My brother and I were kept in a cold and dark place.
For many years.
Like the Center?
Not exactly, Jarod.
Did they hurt you?
Not as much as they hurted my family.
They killed them all.
I will be your family.
I just got words that Dr. Krieg has been extradited to lsrael.
This is just arrived.
Miss Parker.
Thank you.
Syd.
How many psychiatrists does it take to change one light-bulb?
One.
But the light-bulb has to want to change.
Are you alright?
Yes, well.
All my life I revenged against him, Jarod.
When I saw him the last time,
I saw myself.
You are not a monster, Sydney.
And you are stillˇ­
my family.
Tell me something.
Have you ever been fishing?
Why?
Maybe we'll go,
some day,
just you and me.

I understand the pressure that you're under, I do.
Daddy, Daddy.
I know how patient you have been with my handling of Jarod, but,
No more excuses. IĪŁ
wasn't finished.
What?
I thought you came here to kill me.
Better to find the story.
Who are you?
My name is Igor.
- Let me go, Frankenstein.
- I'm going to...
Beautiful, beautiful.
People think spontaneous combustion is a myth.
I don't. I wouldn't be caught dead because of combustion in my pocket. Hey, look at this.
Focus.
There must be an connection between ''ring a bell''
and the Frankenstein movie.
Do you remember any of the dialogue?
Something like:
''Who are you?''
''My name is Igor.''
Hey, Son of Frankenstein!
Basil Rathbone goes back to his dad's castle and meets lgor, Bela Lugosi.
And they bring the monster back to life.
It's not a Jesus James Whale's movie, but,
it's definitely get a chatter.
Oh, you are a lonely man, aren't you?
Look.
It's an angel with the broken wing.
Perhaps Jarod perceives himself as a fallen angel?
Or he simply forgot to put the caution fragile tags on the box?
Hey look!
Igor knows the secret.
What's secret?
The Center throw a rock in you head one.
I am calling Bjorn to getting ... Broots, why don't you watch Son of Frankenstein again,
and see if Basil is a wonder boy.
We have half of our sweapers out there looking for him.
We are gonna find him.
And when we do, we'll have a little spontaneous combustion of my own in mind.
That's him! Get him!
I'll get him out!
Mark, get in!
There are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours, he's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.
How many people died because what I thought up?
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.
He is a pretender.
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.
He defends the weak and abused.
Life is a gift.

DICTATION: ▒┐▒┐/┤ą┤ą
You are a doctor?
I am today.
End, cut!
Beautiful work, Jarod.
That is what I get paid for.
Jarod.
They said that you are the hottest new special ... in town
that I realised that matter literally!
Brynne McLain.
Thank you for comming.
I just never doubt I get invited to alive at your resume.
It's a clever idea, really sense.
Although I've been wondering why a special effects coordinator will actually do that fire stunt himself.
No one pulls the stunter design unless I try to first myself.
- Noble.
- Smart, considering the accident on the Blaster Beer set last week.
I figured the FX coordinator was a little smart
that's exactly what you mean.
Producing a Super Sunday can pay a new beer,
can make a break of an agency.
The accident put it on jeopardy.
Which is what I have wanted you to see for yourself
how my effects ... Say!
Bit better. With commercial time in three million per thirty,
I need Pavarotti.
Twitch, and I'll be watching grey matter of the walls.
- What?
- And how is lgor?
He'd better not snore.
Oh, sounds the noisy makes keep you up,
So sharp toe nails.
It's all funny, Jarod.
- Will you tell me what it means?
- Ask lgor.
Right. ''He knows the secret.''
Can we do the kwit dance another time?
Sure, if you tell the secret of who I am.
You know I cann't help you with that one.
Well, then I cann't help you with this one.
But I have a god's feeling.
You figure it all out.
What're you looking at?
And now we've got Marianne Bosha live on the scene.
Friendship and Fire. As tragedy striked at the filming of Blaster beer commercial.
Stuntman Dave Dugger was hospitalized
with severe burns and head trauma.
who attending to drive this Cadillac through out an exploding billboard.
Although a small explosion was planned
witnesses describe the one occured as massive.
Well, our thoughts and prayers,
at secure ...
as well as Blaster brewery,
that make us blaster beers
all with Dave Dugger and Dugger family.
We all wish Dave Dugger's recovery.
In meantime, we want an internal investigation.
to make sure we get to the bottom of what caused this tragic accident.
Adding irony a pain,
this stunt was maximized by Dugger's long time FX coordinator,
and childhood friend Mickey Clausen.
Dave and me have done some of the stunts a hundren times.
I ... I ... don't know what went wrong.
Dave is my best friend.
Excuse me.
Dave Dugger's hospitalized in the intense care unit of Queen of Hope hospital.
His prognosis remains uncertain.
''Tragedy on Blaster Beer Set''
We thought it's a lot of times expensive in this campaign, Jarod.
Blaster brewery spend millions to launch this new beer.
That's why I hire Jarod, Mr. Connelly. He will make your beer blast through America's TV on Super Sunday.
I like ...
Let me show you what we have in mind.
- You remember Ray Slater. He's my assistant.
- I was Mickey Clausen's assistant.
we redesigned the stunt, so that the Blast trajectory blows over the car,
it'll be safer, yet larger blast.
It'll be a shot to die for.
Hey, Jarod, you have to show your brainstorm to the director.
- lan? Ian?
- Yes.
lan Tottenham, this is Jarod Lugosi, a new special effects coordinator.
Hello, Jaord.
We've all seen explosions,
but we need the audience to feel the explosion,
touch it, taste it,
cry for it.
Excuse me.
Cry for it?
He's pump us and then secure,
But he want a clear directing might .. glu spot.
Sounds revealing.
So you are up to speed on the campaign concept?
Well, I've never actually seen any of the commercials.
Show him spots.
The campaign concept involves around two young guys.
Sean and Joey.
- Who finds tickets to the big game
- In a case of Blaster beer.
- So now they are driving across America...
- In Blastermobile.
- to make a time for gig-off.
- the gig get them lost.
In our first spot, they winded in Louisiana.
and an old Cajun guy tells them to go west.
- so they blast off...
- And they end up here
Wow, check it out, dude!
Polar bears, penguins,
Santa Clause.
Dude, I don't think this is California!
No, man. This is Cream Day.
Let's punk!
Aren't they big talking frogs!
So who are these talking frogs?
Last year's big commercial?
This year will be all Sean and Joey
who in the last spot finally make it to California
- But they ...
- use too much Blaster power
and they end up overshooting in San Diego
when they are crashing a billboard on a beach in Tijuana.
Isn't that great?
So let me get this straight.
There are people out there who will buy your beers
based upon two guys who are not only two ... to read a map.
but simple-minded enough to drive through an exploding billboard?
That's our target market.
Jarod, we've got three days to finish this spot make it on your date.
Can you make a scene?
Like Pavarotti.
I need some remote control to do whatever it does but I can't find it.
I'm sure it's whereabout its line with the clues he's given us.
Come on, lgor, do something.
Catch on fire, ring a bell...
Help me!
Syd, give me your cell phone.
Audio-sense triggering mechanism.
Just like spontaneous combustion that blew up that crate in my office.
Jarod is annoying, but he is clever.
..., Brootsie.
It'll take my fingers off.
Give it to me.
My name is lgor.
''Ring a bell'', lgor knows the secret.
Igor knows the secret.
Igor knows the...Igor knows the secret.
That's it?
Another dead end.
You look just like her
You look just like her.
Just like whom?
Your mother.
lgor knows the secret about your mother.
Cancle clever. Jarod is just annoying.
Broots, I want you to search the man from DSAs, anything else you can think of.
Sydney, check your files. Any reference to lgor,
a name, anagram or acronym, whatever.
Ok, Jarod, you got my attention.
You think we're going to need stuntman for the shoe gag?
Not if we caught the socks with ...
We can put rubbers mat on the shoes.
- That toys came pretty sample?
- It's a model kit.
Didn't build models when you were a kid?
I built the Empire State building once.
And I carved the design of what later became the AMC Pacer out of a bar of soap.
It wasn't my best work.
How long have you been on the program?
Your ... chip.
I've been sober five years and unchanged.
That's great.
Dave Dugger sponsored me on the program.
He was the stuntman that was burned.
Dave is the reason I'm sober today.
And you know, he is the reason I'm alive.
Sounds like a good friend to have.
So what I think it is?
She was built before the fire.
That's what happened when you go to have in the potassium chlorate.
Is that what Brynne's investigation concluded?
They know Mickey Clausen screwed up. Case closed.
I just find it hard to understand how he can screw up so badly.
I mean every effects coordinator knows how reactive PC is.
At show base,
you want to keep good rep,
you get to produce the flash and fx.
So you think Mickey put his best friend in harms way to,
enhance his reputation?
As much as I hate to say.
That's exactly I will say.
Halitosis.
Excuse me?
The creature from death breath.
Now that is destined to become a classical among special effects ...
Do I know you?
I am Jarod Lugosi.
I was wondering if I might pick your brain for a minute.
Yeah, this is the first.
Guy who replaces me on the job comes to ask me for some point.
I always learn from the best.
Those are your folks?
Those are Dave Dugger's parents.
You and Dave are really close, ah?
Yeah, like brothers. His folks practically raised me.
But my days in Dugger's family are over.
Because of the accident?
I must have miscalculated the amount of the oxidizer.
What's that you think happened?
Well, cars don't blow up by themselves.
Were you able to detect anything when you watch the dailies?
I cannot watch them.
Here.
I want you to take them.
I can't see on tape what I see in my nightmares.
I just wish it were me in that car.
Have you seen Dave or his parents since the accident?
I can't face him. I can't face his folks.
Not after this.
If you don't go to the hospital,
they will never know how you feel.
Don't lose the people that you love.
Guy, may you have a good ride. Let's go!
How this happened?
Get him out of it.
Help me, help me!
Oh, no!
How this happen? Get him out...
There wasn't one explosion.
There were two.
You look just like her. lgor knows the secret. My name is Igor. My name...my name is Igor.
- What's wrong with the Igor, Broots?
- I don't know. I don't know what it is.
Forget lgor. What do you mean you didn't find anything?
I searched the main frame, checked all the DSA logs.
Just no acronyms, no anagrams, nothing on Igor.
And I went through my files but I find anything pertaining to anyone but that name.
Igor knows the secret. Figure it out. I've got to get feeling.
Shut that thing up or I swear to God I'll shoot it.
It's out of function. That is automatic.
Don't, Miss Parker.
... got to get feeling.
Got feeling.
Wait, wait, what are you doing?
How to get feeling?
Hi.
I am so sorry. I never meant...
Mickey.
Now the gag would look something like this.
That's it's. I've seen bigger rubber burns.
Those snikers were supposed to step in rock of fuel.
Maybe we should use some our rubber...
Just make it big.
But not too big. We got millions of dollars invested in Joey and Sean.
You should ... on some ... stunt..
That's supposed to be cold supplement and petrol.
Okay, first of all, lan, it's not called petrol. Maybe in your country they are called petrol. But over here in America, we call it gas!
- And second of all, have you been snipping son ...
- Okay, people.
He is right. The gasoline is way too volatile.
Safety doesn't sell beer. Flash does.
I got a day and half left on the shoot. Jarod, work with me here.
I have an idea, Jarod.
Napalm.
Napalm?
Where did you get it?
I made it.
You make your own napalm?
Mickey told me how.
With right balance, you can create massive explosion under control burn.
It's perfect for the shoe gag.
You might have a future in this business.
The tape from inside lgor is a security record of sublevel twenty-seven.
So that's what it looked like before it burned.
April 12, 1970.
The day before your mother died.
Mom!
Mr. Fenigor?
Mr. Fenigor? FenĪŁ
lgor!
Can you recognize him?
Too damn dark.
Did you find out where they're keeping Timmy?
He's in room 155.
I've got to get Jarod and Timmy out of here tonight.
I have got a feeling something's going to happen.
can't escape ... special camera records us now.
I can't have to warn people finding out about these.
I'll take care of it.
The children's lives depend on us.
Who the hell is Timmy?
Somebody Mr. lgor was trying to help my mother rescue.
One was Jarod.
Syd, do you remember Timmy?
I want more co-operation next time.
Who is that?
When can I go home, Dr. Raines?
In good time, Timmy.
He's crying, Sydney.
He's scared.
- I want to talk to him.
- No, Jarod.
Come on.
It was one of Raines' project.
And if this was going on on in SL twenty-seven...
Timmy must have been...
one of Raines' experiments.
Broots
Run in Fenigor. I need to know who he is.
And Sydney, you go through your files again into searching for anything on Timmy.
We're going to find room 155.
What? You mean SL twenty-seven?
Again?
My mother wasn't afraid to go down there. Are you?
Oh, Yeah!
That's Raines' secrets in sublevel.
If he finds out we have been down there, He'll have us killed.
Then make sure he doesn't find out.
With the smoke, it's fire.
You shut up?
I've been sober 5 years and unchanged.
There is actually nothing on Fenigor.
And the only sound of Timmy's stay in the Center
is a simple discharge ...
signed by then Dr. Raines,
dated April 14, 1970.
The day after my mother was killed. How coincidental!
Hey, look!
''Lindbergh Baby Kidnapped''
- Jes
How long has the Center been doing this stuff down here?
Are you going to browse or you are going to help us find ...?
- Sydney, what else do Timmy's records reveal?
- Very little.
No last name, no forwarding addresses.
Common for a routine discharge.
Well, if it was so common then why was my mother so intending to rescue him?
Like the creature said: ''lgor knows the secret.''
The secret as to what got my mother killed maybe even who murdered her.
Easy, Parker.
One stopped at the time.
The information you are talking about could get us all killed.
Miss Parker.
What the hell...?
What is that?
It's a neuro-electric chair.
For a kid? I think I'm going to hurl!
I remember rumours about clandestine experiments involving brain-waves manipulation.
No wonder my mother was trying to save Timmy,
save all the children. This is unbelievable.
Hey, guys
Let's get out of here.
This place was trashed in a fire, we'll never know for sure what's happened to Timmy.
Maybe, maybe not.
What are you thinking, Einstein?
Let's bring in Angelo.
Maybe he can empath what happened down here.
What are you doing?
You cannot sell off your business.
This is your life's work.
Tell that to Dave Dugger and his parents.
Mickey, they are just trying to ... what happened.
Hollywood just ... what happened.
There is no stuntman in this town would work with me again.
I cannot believe that.
Everybody in town knows how wonderful you are at your job.
You are only as good as your last project.
It is over, Jarod.
- Alright, I'll buy it all.
- Excuse me.
I'll buy everything.
Mr. Formald©”hyde.
The lipstick camera you used to trail the cyclops
The bust that you created all these wonderful grotesque figures.
This one is not for sale, alright?
This is Dave Dugger.
We made this bust when our first gig together here.
This is the face I'll always remember.
I do not know what I'm going to do, Jarod.
I just...
What am I going to do?
What's the matter with him? I've never seen him ...!
He is on empath perhaps he is confronting
some negative associations as what he has for SL twenty-seven.
It could have meant both.
Maybe this was not a good idea.
Well if he can tell us something, it is a good idea.
Get him in here.
Come on, let's go, Angelo!
Angelo, Angelo, tell me what happened here?
- Angelo is frightened.
- What happened here, Angelo? Tell me about...
- Miss Parker, please.
- Tell me about Timmy.
Timmy...Timmy
No more Timmy.
- Angelo. Angelo.
- No more Timmy.
Come back, Angelo.
No more Timmy.
- Yeah.
- Ray, It is Jarod.
You're working late.
(I do a little arrangement.)
I have got some good news.
I just came to the hospital, Dave Dugger regains consciousness and he's asking for you.
Ray, are you there?
Yeah.
It's ... that's great news, Jarod.
I'm on my way.
- Is he ok?
- Angelo.
Can you hear me?
Angelo, can you speak?
I am sorry, Angelo.
Please, talk to me.
What you know may help me discover who killed my mother.
Angelo.
Look, I know how much this information means to you.
But down here will you hit a dead end.
Dead end is not our option, Sydney.
Somewhere in this hell hole are the answers about Timmy and Igor,
and the truth about what happened to my mother.
And it's time to take a look in the Raines' private deal and safe files.
Hey, Dave.
Are you awake?
Of course.
Hard to talk.
How are you doing?
(I am not likely to go to dance.)
I am sorry.
Don't get on soft on me, Ray.
Now that have drawn Mickey left meĪŁ
I need my real friends to be strong.
You are the only real friend that I have left.
What's up, buddy?
Your hands are shaking.
I started to drink again, Dave.
Why?
It is the guilt.
About what?
The ... I did to you.
I don't understand.
Mickey didn't do this to you.
He was looking out for you.
But Brynne, she would take no for answer.
One day she talked to me about the explosions
and I told her about my napalm and gave her a little demonstration.
When the explosion happened, I know she's stolen some and put it on the radiator.
I confronted her about it, and she threatened to off me if I talked.
With my background, nobody's going to believe me?
My career, my family
my life would have been oversewd.
I sold you and Mickey out to save myself.
I am sorry, Dave. I am so sorry.
It's ok, Ray.
The first step towards forgiveness,
is telling the truth.
Hello, Brynne?
It is Jarod.
I made an explosive break-through,
and I would like you the first see it.
Would you come to the set, before two o'clock tomorrow?
Wonderful.
Jarod.
You should know I make it apart to never get intimate with any of the man I work with.
Like it's for us. The job ends today.
But we still work here.
I get to tell you I put so much napalm on that billboard.
When this Cadillac hits it,
it's going to explode like Baghdad during the Gulf War.
Watch.
Hey, Brynne, why don't we take Cadillac for a little spin before we turn...?
Okay.
Thank you sir.
(Your belt.)
Do you have something special in mind?
Actually I thought of driving you into that billboard.
- What?
- Don't worry.
I've set it up to be very bit safe as you set up for Dave Dugger.
I even spill Ray's homemade napalm all over the radiator.
Just like you did to Dave.
I am out of here.
Oh, there is no point of struggling.
You know how strong ... glu is.
You created the commercial for it.
Are you insane?
People thought I was when I set myself on fire.
But I did remember to put on the suit and cover myself with Zel-jell.
So I should be just fine.
I am sure Dave Dugger would take the same precautions.
But how was he supposed to know that you re-did another explosion for inside of his car?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, maybe a little 3rd degree burn will help your memory.
Jarod.
Oh, come on, Brynne.
You will be a shot to die for, remember?
Jarod, please!
Why would you put napalm on the radiator?
The bigger the explosion the better the commercial?
You tell me something.
What demographic says that the beer sales are more important than that man's life.
The commercial had been ... lost in account.
What about what Mickey Clausen lost?
What about Dave Dugger?
They lost everything. The only thing you could have lost was just a job.
Just a job?
I work my ... to get what I am.
It is a boys' club.
Through glass ceilings I am not about to lose it all because a funky special effects guy was too soft to do the job we paid him for.
You know something, Brynne?
I don't think your ...agency is going to be giving your ... officer after all this.
Look on the bright side,
maybe you have a career ahead of you.
In stunt work.
Jarod, Jarod.
Jarod.
No, Jarod.
- Did the camera record all that, Mickey?
- We got we want.
That's rep.
I found Timmy.
In Raines archives.
Run them.
Mrs Parker, what are you doing here?
I came by to visit Timmy.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Well, Dr Raines, my husband thinks it's important my visit with hold the children.
Wait here.
Hi.
Timmy, my name is Catherine. How are you doing?
I miss my mum and dad..
I know you do, honey.
Come on, Timmy!
That's it?
Well, there is another one dated on the following day.
No, no. Timmy.
You ... to come in here.!
My god.
What have you done to that little boy?
It was an experiment!
My husband was ... for this!
You don't know your husband as well as you think you do.
I advise you remain quiet about this.
You know what's best for you.
Timmy!
Raines, what you can do with Timmy now?
There is no Timmy any more.
From now on, he is being calledĪŁ
Angelo.
Is Timmy Angelo?
What, what Raines do to him?
Somehow his emotions,
his ability to relate to the physical world,
were driven invert.
And gave Angelo his unique gift.
But took away his life.
Were you involved in this?
If I had known about this,
I would have done everything in my power to stop it.
And then you were dead.
Just like my mother.
So you actually sold your effects stuff?
Yeah, I know, I know. I don't suppose you will be willing to sell it back.
For the right price.
Then charge him double.
It's ... think he did this to me.
Thanks a lot, Jarod.
Hi, Mickey.
Mickey.
Timmy is gone.
White choose the ... variation,
to answer the blacks, ... in defence.
Very good, Jarod.
Who are you, Mr. lgor?
Sydney, when do I get to meet that boy?
He is gone.
What do you mean ''gone''?
I received a copy of paperwork today.
Dr. Raines released him.
Did he do something wrong?
He wasn't special.
You were special, Timmy.
What?
How are you coming with my ..feeling?
You need to ask?
Why the game, with the creature, why not just tell me?
Sometimes the destination isn't as important as the journey.
Well, where on your journey,
did you find that... ?
In one of your mother's safe deposit boxes.
Like her wedding ring and medical file.
Oh, you will be surprised what one could find in there.
Jarod.
You know the dance, Miss Parker.
You help me with one of my secrets,
I help you with one of yours.
We weren't able to find anything about lgor or Fenigor.
I don't know if he was my mother's ... or betrayer.
Keep searching.
lgor, he holds the secrets to both our pasts.
What makes you so sure?
Call it,
you got feeling.

Getting out a little early today, Sydney.
Jarod.
My god, Jarod. They are going to see you.
Something bad is happening, Sydney.
There is not much time left.
Jarod, let's get out of here.
I need answers.
- Answers?
- Who I am? Where I came from?
Who my parents are?
Just give me something.
Even if it's just a name.
But I need to know now.
So do I.
Jarod.
Me too.
I don't understand.
He deserves answers, Sydney.
Jacob!
I don't understand, Jacob.
It is complicated.
Please, Sydney.
I don't have much time.
Good morning, Broots.
Sorry to interrupt.
- Let me guess, Jarod?
- Yeah.
Just arrived this morning. He bought it from some place called the of Astro Arcade of lndianapolis.
He wasing working in a pin-ball parlor?
No, actually he was just hanging out.
The owner said he played this exact game for almost twenty-four hours straight
on one single coin.
Impressive!
Oh yeah!
And what Sydney is taking on, game boy?
Oh, Sydney.
He left this email.
''Our suffocated friend is awake.''
He is awake.
Jacob is a threat to Center interest.
Make sure Jacob never wakes up again.
''I'll be away fishing.''
Find out where Sydney is.
Thirty-one point four eight. This one is fast.
It's still more a few seconds of the track records.
It's five years you spent to attain this speed, R.J.
This guy isn't even on back just backed you.
What he says his last name was?
Jones.
He drives like Parnelli. That's for ... Let's go.
As the MCl car is coming in to the ... lane,
Tests are now open for the next hour.
That was incredible!
Thank you!
You are a some driver!
Excuse me.
Wonder how the secrets.
You know I could get faster. My foot slipped off the gas pedal going turn four.
Where did you learn to drive a race car?
lndianapolis.
Really? The brickyard?
The Astro Arcade.
There are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.
How many people died because of what I thought up?
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.
He is a pretender.
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.
He defends the weak and abused.
Life is a gift.

DICTATION: ±ż±ż/´Đ´Đ
You are a doctor?
I am today.
Jarod, this is Nigel Brinkman, our number one driver.
- Welcome to the big show, Jarod.
- Nice to be here.
Jarod is going to be taking over the number three car for Jimmy.
He had an accident in Milwaukee, didn't he?
My son broke his leg.
Doctor said it will be at least a year until he drives again.
But he will, you know why, he is a Roemer.
Jimmy got a little ... himself.
He took R.J.'s car and just cut the tyre and pulled it into a wall.
Well I can understand why R.J. would be a little defensive.
My son's going to handle it.
That's racing.
Come on, we take you to settle in.
I accept nothing but the best for my drivers, Jarod.
I can see that.
This one is an oldy.
Guess you can see that knife was R.J.'s first trophy.
He gained this in the India Lights Championship.
There is winning the national ...
There is finished in second at Long Beach . I am not sure why that I haven't seen it up there.
I would have won that race if the car's been set up right.
Really?
I don't remember our chief mechanic driving the car that day.
Hawkes is a dinosaur.
R.J., the visiting hours of the hospital are over...
- Oh, sorry. I don't realize that any...
- It is okay, darling, come in.
I think I get to go check the telemetry readings on the practise.
You are not going to see Jimmy?
Well, I'll try, okay?
Anna, this is Jarod Jones. He is taking over Jimmy's ride.
And this is my daughter-in-law.
Hi.
Pleasure.
She will give you a race paperwork started then we turn a test at one.
Well, this is uncomfortable.
It's racing.
I heard about your husband's accident.
I hope he'll be alright.
Thanks.
Doctor says it's too soon to tell if it left damages on
permanent.
You need to fill in a background information form.
Background information?
So the media and sponsors know who you are.
I am not really interested in the publicity.
In this business you will answer more questions and eat more cocktail winnies than you've thought possible.
I am sure that everything is going to work out.
It looks like your family is very close.
Sounds that way, don't they?
''Jimmy Roemer Wipes Out Brother's Car in Practice''
''Jimmy Roemer's Career in Doubt''
Anything yet?
Well, I've gone over Sydney's messages dozen times. And the best I can come up with is ''gone to white cloud''.
Where?
Sydney has a cabin up in the mounts in white cloud lake.
He goes there to fish sometimes.
Sydney and trout.
Boggles the mind.
Do you know where it is?
Oh, yeah.
Write down the directions.
I still don't get the part about ''our suffocated friend is awake''.
The directions, Broots.
The last word is ''white cloud''.
You don't have to draw me a map.
So you both drive for the same team, but you race against each other?
Not exactly. R.J. here is what you might call my
supporting.
I don't understand.
Let's why we get ringroad here. It's little confused which my confrere smells my exhaust fume at most of the race.
I'm sorry.
It got away from me.
You didn't sign me this morning.
I was in your pit earlier.
Oh, yes. Are you a driver too?
Yeah.
Now, when you talked about the life and death aspect of racing
you come right to the heart of the drivers' very existence.
Really!
Did you want something?
Yes, I don't have a big car yet and I was wondering if you give me a lift.
I need to visit someone.
Yeah, alright.
It is the hospital Jimmy's in.
I thought I should meet the man I was serving for.
You wanna join me?
It must be difficult.
Working so hard,
never get a supporting you need to win.
I will win. I have to.
What was Jimmy doing in your car the day of crash?
He saw the pathetic data on the three car.
Jimmy wanted to know what's like to drive a competitor ride.
I feel sorry for him. And give him a shot. And the story.
According to the data after the crash,
Jimmy had a throttle wide open when he hit the wall.
I love my brother, but,
he didn't know his limits.
Your brother has a very rare disease.
In Jacob's case he's stimulated the brain and seems like... awaked areas injured years earlier.
Is he aware of the surroundings?
On and off. His motor skills are very elementary.
and his speech appears to be limited to single word out of he says.
I would like to see him now.
Well, before you do it, something else you should know about your brother's condition.
Jacob.
Can you hear me?
This is Sydney.
May we...
Care...
She's on phone...
Greta...
He seems to be drifting from one thought to another.
I am not sure who this Greta woman is.
Greta was our mother's name.
Jacob.
Listen to this carefully.
Do you know what year it is?
1942.
I'd like to take him with me.
Mr. Raines.
We've gone playing the Sydney's telephone tape.
You're right. His brother is still alive.
But you will take care of that, won't you?
My pleasure.
Sun too hot?
Nah, I am fine.
Doctors say you can start re-... in another month.
I'd start today if it were on my way.
That's my little brother, getting no good when he's sitting on it.
Where have you been, stranger?
I have better things to do than hanging out the bunch of gimps.
Yeah. What's your name?
Guilty.
Anna.
I thought you won't coming.
Got to have faith in your family.
Can you get my baseball cap in my room? I am getting a little toasted out here.
Yeah, sure.
Hey, here.
Don't eat too many candy bars. You would be driving last car in next year.
Hi, Jimmy Roemer.
Jarod Jones.
Jarod is driving number three car.
Good for you.
Win one for the whole team.
I'm just keeping your place warm until you get back.
How are you feeling?
Like a runner with a flat tyre.
Just take and slow.
It'll all come back to you.
I feel pretty stupid parking ... ride to the wall.
I mean, I know I blacked out, but I swear I was braking.
The engine just kept ... after I made contact.
Hey, accidents happen.
You remember my prom night?
Dad was peeled out!
I rocked my ... around a telephone pole.
Of course he didn't cost a hundred grand to have it fixed.
Fill me up, will you?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Hard to believer I drive a race car, huh?
Like you say, accidents happen.
I am taking you out of here, Jacob.
To the cabin of the white cloud.
You used to love going to white cloud, remember?
Go that way. I will take the stairs.
Okay, drop the mop.
He can't understand you.
- Hey, Jarod.
- Hey, Mario
Nice run. I was watching you.
Just a little tip. Going for turn one, just keep it down a bit, be lower. Stay below the bumps.
I think you gonna like it.
- I love that tips.
- Take care.
Seventeen races, six months without podium finish! This, gentleman is unacceptable.
And that is why we are now going to be into race as eighteen.
Meaning?
Meaning you gonna do whatever it takes to get the number one car out front and keep it there.
What about me?
Me, me, me, there is no me.
It's a team sport now.
I want you and Jarod to let Nigel drive behind your cars,
block out the leaders so he can gain track position, okay?
Excuse me.
Blocking is ... offence.
- It's called racing.
- Yeah, so basically Jarod and I are just traffic cops.
You have any idea how much money it takes to support three cars?
Fine, dad, I just meant...
Sponsors want to see their product in victory lane.
otherwise they find another team.
And you go back to ...junk with monster trucks.
Which means driving smart, not like that lose kind of brother of yours.
Son of bitch.
Hey, hey, R.J.
Cool down.
Come on, Hawkes is right.
Jimmy had that business be in number two car, you know it.
Yeah, and check the race in last time, I should be top right.
Yeah, right.
Come on, Hawkes, I'll show you some in the front of ...
Someone should shot that son of bitch for good.
You see, that's the kind of Roemer spirit that I am looking for.
I just want to some of them on the track.
Some much for the home team.
Sydney.
Sydney.
Oh, god. You scared the hell out of me.
You are expecting to find two corpses, Miss Parker?
What did Raines promise you?
What are you talking about?
The sweeper team that showed up at the hospital.
You called Raines up, didn't you?
Admit it!
Let go of me, Sydney.
You are the only one who knows my brother is still alive.
Raines thinks I murdered Jacob.
If he knew he was still alive, I would be in more danger than anyone.
I suggest you just check your home phone for bugs.
And let go of me.
Has he said anything?
I need to reach him, Parker.
I need answers.
Answers?
About what I've done.
You did brake, Jimmy. But your engine kept running.
Jimmy used to walk the stands for every race.
He said that felt like being in church.
Thanks for getting R.J. to go to see Jimmy.
...his brother.
I thought I might help.
Yeah.
How is he doing?
...he feels like he failed.
Failed?
Me, R.J., mostly his dad.
Grant is pretty intense.
Yeah, he always encouraged them to compete against each other.
No wonder when Jimmy was seven,
Grant took him and R.J. out to a cabin,
made them each chop a quarter wood,
told them the winner get a brand new Odekirk fishing knife and fishing attachments.
I saw the photograph in the trailer.
Right, now there is no way a couple of kids can cut out that wood.
And Grant knew that.
But he left them out there alone in the cold.
What happened?
There is a lumber yard nearby.
So R.J. .. a tractor,
rides up the hill,
buys himself a fresh cut .. wood,
and wins the knife.
Sounds like the real prides was winning his father's approval.
And he would do anything to get it.
Something's never changed.
Sydney.
Sydney.
Catherine.
You remember my mother?
You look just like her.
Yes.
But you remember her.
Jacob.
Please Jacob, try to remember.
Why can't you remember?
Because he is dying.
The same virus that will awaken Jacob
is also killing him.
He has less than twelve hours left.
I am sorry, Sydney.
What can we do?
Broots is bringing some my personal items.
Photos or movies.
If only I can help Jacob remember,
maybe he can tell us something about your mother.
Or about Jarod.
Or maybe he can simply die,
Knowing who he is.
It's okay.
Now there Andretti is racing ...
But stay low, avoid the bumps. You will be glad you did.
Something about that voice sounds kind of familiar.
But thanks.
- What's that?
- I came across it a throttle cable from Jimmy's crashed engine.
- Well, you are a car inspector now?
- I just want to know how things work.
I couldn't figure out what these scratches were.
Jimmy bent the cable plate.
And what happens when the cable plates bent?
You bent the cable plate, your throotle stick.
Is that what happened to Jimmy?
Look, I did a car inspection after the accident.
Jimmy's crash had nothing to do with a mechanic error.
Well, then how do you explain these marks?
Damage in the crash.
Come on, I am not a mechanic. But these marks are looked they were made by set of pliers.
You are right. You are not a mechanic.
Oh, well, this place is really nice.
Hey.
Here.
Hey, do you think maybe I can rent here for some weekend I can bring my daughter here?
- That's it?
- Yes, it's over.
You can leave now.
Okay.
Can, can I at least go to the bathroom first? Is it through here?
Broots, wait.
What's going on?
My Brother Jacob is quite ill.
You breed a word of this to anybody and to every diary case and America would be ... your face.
Got it?
Yeah.
Go back to the Center, if you notice anything unusual,
you call me. We need protection for at least for another ten hours.
Understood?
Yeah, as good as it never gone out.
Why would you want to kill your own brother, R.J.?
Yeah, I just come back.
No, it's quiet. Everything seems to be really cool.
Of course, I won't say anything.
Miss Parker.
Could you do me a favor?
Could you wish Sydney good luck...
Miss Parker?
Hello?
God, I hate her when she does that.
Mr. Raines.
Damn it!
I am sorry about that, man.
Hey!
So didn't that eat you up, R.J.?
Now I have to make some major buddy work.
You wouldn't happen to have a small screwdriver or a set of pliers, would you?
Someone broke the lock of garage and stole all the pliers last night.
Really? Can't trust anybody these days.
Hey, Jones, try this.
Odekirk.
It's very difficult to come by.
Where did you get this?
I won it about a year ago.
From whom?
From me.
Data hate the soon losers, right?
Did R.J. threaten to take your number one car, Brinkman?
Remember those tennis matches in Yale?
I still think you let me win so that I wouldn't feel so bad.
Jacob.
Listen to me.
There are things you know, Jacob.
Things that can help others.
Remember Jarod?
You signed him into the Center.
the night he was brought there.
Parker and I found files at SL twenty-seven.
Your signature was on Jarod's entrance report.
Think back.
where did he come from?
What was his real name?
His parents name?
That is the least I can do for him.
Since your car accident, I've done things, Jacob,
Unspeakable things,
to protect Jarod,
to protect you.
I even tried to kill Dr. Raines.
But the bullet hit his oxygen tank and...
It's pretty ..., huh?
I rebuilt Jimmy's engine from the crash.
All by myself.
I did however have to replace
this damaged throttle cable.
Maybe I should be a car inspector.
What do you want?
Do you remember these markings?
It turns out they were indeed made by a pair of pliers.
Pliers from another Odekirk knife.
This Odekirk knife.
Used to belong to R.J.,
but R.J. lost it in a bet to Nigel Brinkman.
What's this got to do with me?
I am glad you asked.
This is a videotape,
from the surveillance cameras in the garages of Milwaukee.
It's dated the day before Jimmy's crash.
It shows you letting Nigel Brinkman into the number two car garage.
Brinkman was worring that R.J. was going to take over the number one car.
How was he supposed to know that Jimmy was going to be behind that wheel that day?
Why would I want to hurt R.J.?
Because you wanted Nigel to replace this cruel boss.
I found resumes.
Resumes of people applying for your job.
Oh, god.
I am fifty-six years old.
I can't start over again.
I never want to hurt Jimmy.
What the hell was that kid doing in that car anyway?
He was covering for me.
Your hand.
Yeah.
I started having spasms about six months ago.
Day of the race, I was so bad. I could barely hold the wheel.
That I asked Jimmy to cover for me.
I've seen cases like yours.
It's treatable.
Yeah, I will take care of it later.
It's time to think Jimmy.
I messed up, Jarod.
I let down my father and almost killed my little brother.
You didn't know that Brinkman messed with the engine.
I know now.
I am going to do everything I can to make it right.
We all will.
No, don't lie to me.
I tell you, I don't know anybody named Jacob.
Six hours, Mr. Broots.
Is all this discomfort worth for protecting someone like Sydney?
I don't know what you are talking about.
Well then, maybe I can help drag your memory.
Look, okay, I think I start to remember.
Hello, Anna. It is Jarod.
Jimmy would be able to come to the track tomorrow?
''Cart Headquarters''
Nigel, it's Jarod.
Hawkes thinks he made a break through on your set up.
Can you do a little testing in the morning?
Great. I'll see you then.
I tell you, I don't have enough courage in the bets.
Yeah.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah.
- Could you direct me the public address bead?
- There is a rack in the back.
That's what the problem is.
You only got five cameras out there, and I need twice that many.
Why don't you walk on the camera truck?
Television! I'd be out of my mind.
Can we at least get it on camera positions?
Only one and a half seconds
seperating the two cars in the front roads...
Nigel! Glad you made it here.
Hey, if you boys think you can get some more speed out this car, I am ready to go.
Where is Grant?
Considering what's on at last meeting,
Hawkes thought it would be wise if we kept this between us until we save the fence up.
Okay, let's go to run.
Here you go.
Alright, Nigel, have a good run!
Ready?
Go!
How did you feel?
So far so good.
I'm going to warm up then you'll see what you can do.
What the hell Brinkman is doing out there?
You should watch this.
And then we have to talk.
I'm going to roam up the next turn round.
How does it feel, Nigel?
Oh, man, there isn't any better than this.
Come on, Nigel, you can go faster than that.
Jarod, what are you doing out there?
I am just trying to find out what really happened to Jimmy's car before the crash.
I don't know what you are talking about.
Lies.
This is what I am talking about.
I don't know anything about Jimmy's accidental crash.
I am pulling in.
Not so fast, Nigel.
..game up. I have control on your car.
You are out of your mind.
Think so?
What the hell I can't..?
Now you know how it feels.
Careful, I really hate to see you crash.
What the hell is going on?
I want to know why you sabotage R.J.'s car.
Why you nearly killed Jimmy Roemer?
You are not making sense, Jarod. Now stop this car!
Stop it, Jarod.
...
Give you a information that I had your filled tank on top.
So you should be good for at least
seventy laps.
Bad news is I put on four old tyres.
My guess is one of them will blow any time now.
You know what that means.
I can't hold this any more.
That's the idea.
Oh, right.
I ... R.J.'s car, but I didn't know that Jimmy's going to behind that wheel, I swear.
I cann't lose.
Now you know how Jimmy felt.
I'm getting to the wall. Jarod, Jarod.
You said it yourself, Nigel.
That's racing.
Nigel Brinkman? Come with us, please.
Please, Sydney.
I don't have much time.
Sydney.
I am here, Jacob.
I want you to know that no matter what you did,
what we did,
I never blame you.
I think that together we rob Jarod of his life.
And for that we will be judged.
But I'm not allowed to be angry,
and to forgive.
And I only hope that,
one day,
Jarod can feel the same.
Gene.
Gene?
Gene who?
Here, try to write it down.
Is it Jarod's real name?
Or his father's?
Who is Gene?
Please Jacob, I need to know.
I am sorry, Sydney.
Jacob love this song.
And this place.
He came to finally find his rest here.
Where is he?
- Do you have any sevens?
- Got fish.
Check the bedroom.
Give you five?
You got to be cheating.
No one.
I know Jacob was here.
You are mistaken.
My brother is dead.
It's dangerous to deceive the Center.
I wouldn't push him.
A man with a temper to match his marksmanship.
Dangerous combo.
It's a beautiful place.
Jarod.
How did you know?
I called Broots.
He told me about Jacob.
He said you will be away from the Center for a few days, so I took a chance.
Hard to be alone on the world, do we?
I hope Jacob's passing was ... easy.
I believe it was.
Before he died,
my brother gave me this.
What does it mean?
Maybe your name,
maybe your parents'.
I wish I could be sure.
Anyway,
I hope it'll help you find your own peace on the world.

I'll take that, Jarod.
Why have you been stealing these?
I've been making this.
A house?
A home.
This is where I grew up.
This is what I can remember.
What's home like, Sydney?
Seems window lab rats wear Hugo Boss.
It's like something out of GQ.
How would you know?
There must be twenty thousand dollars with the designer clothes here.
It appears that you have a fashion competitor, Miss Parker.
What's he up to, Syd?
A form of expression. Individuality, strength.
Showing off his colors the way of mating animals.
You might right about the mating part
The Kama Sutra of Love.
What's your boy learning from this?
I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.
Jarod.
lsabella.
I've heard that superhero was dead.
Only slightly wounded.
Do you prefer to be called '' escort'' or ''gigolo''?
Well, why don't you give me one hour,
and you tell me.
There are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent then any of our others.
How many people died because of what I thought up?
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.
He is a pretender.
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.
He defends the weak and abused.
Life is a gift.

DICTATION: ±ż±ż/´Đ´Đ
You are a doctor?
I am today.
Why leave all of this behind?
Jarod operates on the different level than other people.
The all must mean something, always does.
Hey, you guys come here to take a look at this.
''Follow me to the 1500 Hart Street.''
It seems pretty simple.
Let's find out.
Your cut.
Did the Kama Sutra come in handy?
- I lent my copy to a friend.
- Wow, you must memorize it.
A gift from lsabella.
What the hell did you do to that woman?
I just listened.
I can't decide who gets you next.
I hear Cynthia Sloan is lucky.
European countess to Detroit socializee?
Just because she is the only woman in Forbes fifty doesn't mean that I can't satisfy her.
Remember, Jarod.
They are paying for a fantasy, not paying for a man.
Do you think you can become someone else?
I'll do my best.
He splits up the terms and your employment for obvious reason, you've been hired as a...
Special consultant.
Everything you see and do
is strictly confidential.
Of course.
It's quite a house.
You should see the other six.
Seven.
Hello.
I am Jarod.
He signed?
It's a requirement of Frank's.
He oversees all my holdings and new ventures.
And which one am I?
You will be a little of both.
Well.
Let the games begin.
Let's lay the ground of you here for one reason.
Men have a tendency to hit on me,
you are going to save me there in convenience.
You are .. , Jarod, a piece of jewelry.
So that I have to shine.
Well, for five thousand dollars a week, I expect you to blind me.
You will be on call until the ribbon cutting on saturday.
For that?
Sloan towers.
The future of downtown Detroit.
Well, this is the future.
Then this, must be history.
Save our home!
Save our home! Save our home! Save our home! Save our..
What's like to have a home, Sydney?
Save our home! Save our home! Save our home!...
''Boy Plunges to Death''
Leave him alone.
He broke his wing.
I wish Michael was here.
Michael Edwards.
The boy that fell from the fire escape.
He.. the birds.
He gonna be veterinarian when he grow up.
I was a veterinarian once.
Can you make him fly again?
I don't know.
Tracy Johnson, you get off this roof, right now.
I gotta go.
Girl is going to get herself killed.
I run the neighbourhood watch program in this building. And your face doesn't look familiar.
I was just trying to help the bird.
I guess that Michael Edwards cared for them.
What do you know about Michael?
Just what I've read.
This is where it happened.
I told that boy a thousand times to stay off this roof.
My name is Jarod.
Alice Evans.
Nice to meet you, Alice Evans.
Three stories he fell straight down.
Then they condemn this place.
Now Cynthia Sloan can get her .. clause on the only raw property left in the city.
Throw hundreds of family out of their homes.
The fire escapes, they don't collapse under the weight of a eight-year-old boy.
The city said it was the wether.
You are not been living down in two-twelve for nearly forty years.
Suddenly, the bricks start crumbling like sodas.
I don't think so.
I only I wish I've been around to help him.
Look, I can't take on another client.
I am on Cynthia Sloan's back and call night and day.
Don't worry about that. This one sounds like a one shot deal.
But you are not going to getting away with talking this time.
This one is got the itch.
The itch?
Go scratch it.
Yes.
I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.
What?
The service I mean.
Oh, the service, right.
That was quick.
Ah, may I come in?
Yes, please. Would you come in?
''Happy Valentine's Day''
Help yourself.
I made coffee.
It's French roast.
How do you know what's inside of it?
Oh, you don't.
That's the fun part.
Oh.
Who is Valentine?
You don't...They didn't say you will be handsome and funny.
The truth is, I've neverˇ­
done anything like this.
Now, do I make the cheque out to you personally,
Oops, or do I make it out to the service?
We can figure that out later.
Or make it out to cash.
I couldn't help noticing the man living over the garage.
Oh, that was Howard, my husband.
Your husband?
Soon to be ex, I mean. He is living about the garage until we settle things.
Oh, I must have forgot.
I bought a box from a drug store.
It was on special, so...
The twelve pack.
Safety first.
I saw that on TV.
You seemed a little nervous, Joyce.
Nervous, no, no, not me.
I love a house with pictures.
It makes you feel like a home.
My son, my last went off to college this year. Oh, I miss him.
Can't say the same for Howard.
Was it another woman?
Oh, hardly.
You know what Howard bought me for my twenty-fifth wedding anniversary.
A toaster.
I saved up and bought us tickets to Paris, kind of like second honeymoon.
Howard couldn't take off time from work.
So we cashed in the tickets and bought a big screen TV.
Fifty inches.
French roasts are all if I'll get to Paris.
Now.
I here that I get what I pay for.
So.
You must miss your children.
What?
Do they know?
Know?
That you hired a lover.
The accidental death of Michael Edwards
let the city to condemn Jefferson Heights.
These residents are protesting their invasion.
In four days, their homes will be demolished.
For some of them it is ...
They tried the same thing after the fire of seventy-seven.
The tenants fought in, and they won.
Back then the residents won renovation and set off demolition.
But they never had the deal with real estate noble Cynthia Sloan.
Miss Sloan, can we get a statement from you today?
My heart goes out to Michael Edwards and his family.
But Jefferson Heights is dangerous. I am doing the city and all the residents a favor.
Some said that after Michael Edwards died, you strong arm the city ... contract.
Sloan development won this big bet on square.
I make no excuses for being competitive.
You do what it takes to close the deal,
whatever it takes.
Miss Sloan. Miss Sloan.
whatever it takes.
Sulphur chloride.
What's all the sulphur chloride for?
It has been used in demolition.
The sulphur chloride can start to weaken the brick.
The whole building will come down like a house of cards.
Excuse me.
- One more question.
- Show.
Valentine's day.
Specifically Cupid.
Yeah.
A corpulant infant who happens to be an archer
goes around shooting arrows into people and suddenly they are in love?
- It's about it.
- And to show that love, people buy each other chocolates and other sweets.
Do they want to be fat like the infant?
What was you said you take for Miss Sloan?
Special consultant.
Sounds dangerous.
You have no idea.
Bye.
The address Jarod left on the candy is to an adult bookstore?
You have got to be kidding me.
Let's just get this over with.
What's wrong, Broots?
Oh, it's kind of embarrassing. I've never been into this kind of place before.
Right, and I am the presidents of the PTA.
It's all starting to come back to you, isn't it, Broots?
Jarod must have brought us here for a reason.
It's called humiliation.
Is there anybody here?
I'll be right with you.
We would like to speak to the owner about a friend.
Rex is the owner. He is dead.
I'm Bucky la Fountain. I run the place.
You mentioned something about a friend?
He left these.
Why didn't you just say you were looking for Jarod in the first place?
Come on.
Come on back.
Anybody hungry?
Yeah, Jarod was a real emotional guy.
Smart though.
Invented this portable smoke cleaner.
Are you sure you don't want me to ... you a wing?
Positive.
Do you know where Jarod went?
Not a clue.
He just stopped comming in.
What did you say that he was interesting in the material you sell?
No way.
He wasn't in the sexuality part. He just wanted to talk about people.
About what makes us want each other.
You know between you and me, I don't think that work out much love growing up.
I think that's why he must be so proud of the book.
The book?
I run a small publishing company on the side.
Romance novels and such.
Are you seeing Jarod actually wrote one of these novel?
Yeah.
There.
''The Saddest Little Valentine''
He did the cover art, too.
That boy's definitely one of a kind.
One is enough.
This looks stunning one.
Have this ready for the night.
You are not very big in pictures, are you?
That you got a lot of awards. But only one photograph.
Photographs, that make a house a home.
Don't you think?
Is this you?
My father bred racehorses as a hobby.
That was painful.
My pride ...
I still have the scar.
It used to be much worse but the plastic surgeons keep withering a way in it.
So, where is your family?
You asked your clients so many questions?
Only the special ones.
Don't you get lonely here?
The City turned down the demolition plan.
I've called a meeting.
I don't have time to get lonely.
Don't be late tonight.
- Hello?
- Yes, I spoke with Joyce.
She said she was vaguely unfulfilled.
What's wrong with you? She's a housewife. ... she melts.
I don't know exactly what she wants.
Jarod, if you call a plumber, you want your pipes fixed. She called a gigolo...
I, I understand. But...
Fix her pipes and Jarod, I don't want to have this conversation again, right?
I just get it washed.
What do you think?
It is the car drives her crazy.
Joyce.
Hi, there.
Rumor has your feeling vaguely unfulfilled.
I've been waiting for you.
You do realize that your husband is out in the garden.
I know.
You won't regret this later?
The hell with regrets.
I know you are up there, Howard. Coming, I am calling the police.
The number is 911.
Oh, I am so sorry.
It is okay.
It's strange though.
Strange? What?
Well, you say your husband doesn't care about you any more.
Sure it doesn't look that way to me.
Hey.
Jarod.
I didn't mean to buy your head off, but I thought you were another one of those inspectors.
Inspector?
I don't think you'll be seeing anymore of those.
Your home is already condemned.
Are you kidding? These bureaucratics are all over this place.
Even before Michael fell.
Somebody inspected the fire escape before it collapsed?
Yeah, he was independently wealthy like you.
Like me?
He had one of those fancy handsome metal on his wrist too.
Like this?
...diamonds.
Excuse me. I would like to propose a toast.
First of all, to this work of art,
that some people call the building,
the sign may says ''Sloan Tower'',
but this entire project was the dream of my right hand man,
of my right arm,
Frank Linden.
This is been his baby from the beginning, and if I don't give him promotion for this,
then I should fire myself.
When everyone said it couldn't be done, including me.
Frank found a way.
To ''Sloan Towers''.
Whatever it takes.
Whatever it takes.
''5/29/77 Jefferson Heights Protest''
Hey, how are you feeling today?
Would you like one of these?
They are very good.
Have you ever tried one of these?
It says: be mine.
Got one that says: You are fired.
Fired?
I am tired of calls from this household Column. You're through with her.
And with Cynthia Sloan.
I must sign in a replacement.
Just before the ribbon cutting?
You think that's smart?
Cynthia Sloan is one of your prides clients.
Fine.
You want to keep Cynthia? Then scratch the housewife's itch.
This is Sydney.
Why do people fall in love?
You might as well ask why the stars come out at night.
Everyone spends their whole life searching for that special someone.
The person to love.
But when they finally find them,
it all falls apart.
Paradox of man.
Try to believe it is better to have love and lost than never to have love at all.
So you believe that the love is worth fighting for,
and that's worth the pain and effort?
It's that what you're trying to say in the romance novel you left for Miss Parker?
The book speaks for itself, Sydney.
She felt consumed by a great void,
an dark and silent abyss,
as terrifying as the grand palace around her.
But somewhere in the chilling blackness she caught a glims of light.
She remembered the time,
the precautious of a little girl with a heart full of fire,
a soul flamed by passion,
and the smile that could melt the winter into spring.
But the light was gone, the flame had died.
Her past was taken from her beloved soldiers of the great palace.
She would continue searching,
hoping to rekindle the fire.
And to then,
she will always be,
the saddest little Valentine.
Hello, Joyce.
This is Jarod.
Come on in.
This is quite what I imagined.
Nothing ever is.
Can I pour you a drink?
Yes, sure.
Oh, that vibrates! Oh, my gosh.
We will get to that later.
Now it's just you,
and me.
No one can disturb us.
Especially, that annoying husband of yours.
What's with you, Joyce? It's what you're here for.
Don't tell me you think about Howard.
That husband doesn't deserve you.
I know how much polyester can one man wear anyway.
Poly, uh, what?
And the physiqueˇ­
What is it? A body about a chili dog?
Well, you know Howard is a little chunky, he is.
The Santa Claus is chunky.
Howard is only violation.
Well, you know, Howard has his faults, butˇ­
He is a kind and gentle human being.
He bought you a toaster for your anniversary.
He cashed in your tickets to Paris for a television set.
Well, fifty inches actually.
You know, that's just Howard.
Forget about him, forget about that whole night.
Well, you know, Jarod, you just don't forget about twenty-five years of marriage.
We've been through a lot. I mean we is the family.
- We uh...
- Made a home?
You are right.
You don't forget about twenty-five years of your marriage.
And you don't forget your home.
Some people,
they can go through their whole lives without ever having one.
Come on.
I'll take you home.
Thank you.
What's wrong, Jarod?
You seem upset. You've been sitting here staring for hours.
Tell me what's wrong?
No, no....
- Jarod, why are you doing that?
- I don't have a home, Sydney. I can't remember anything.
I don't have a home. I don't have a home. I don't have a home.
Save our home! Save our home!....
So much anger.
Don't they realize that it's not safe to live there any more.
It is much easier for you to say.
If this place strated falling down, you have six others to choose from.
They don't have what you have.
Great education, rich parents, your own horses.
People change.
Some more than others.
Cynthia.
Cynthia, are you watching this?
They don't leave.
They can't.
I want you permission to call the police.
- Oh, that will be great ..
- Please.
Look, Cynthia. These people are breaking city ordinance now.
I can have Alderman Nance called the chief settle all the motion.
Go talk to them.
Tell them that their building is unsafe, explain it to them face to face.
They won't listen.
Then call the police.
Start a riot.
Whatever it takes.
We won't go. We won't go...
I've been expecting you.
- Hello, Jarod.
- Alice.
What is going on here?
Hi, Jarod.
This is Cynthia.
You are the lady who's going to take down my house?
Jarod said you like horses.
I found this when we moved in.
It was in a secret hiding-place. Want to see?
How did you know?
That's you.
You are Cindy.
How did you know?
You can find just about anything.
If you know the right place to look for it.
Who are you?
Someone who believes that everyone deserves to have a home.
Even Cindy Morgan.
I changed my name, Jarod, but I didn't hurt that little boy.
No, but you're partly responsible.
Why are you so determining to destroy this places where you grew up?
That was my past.
So you thought you could just get rid of it like you get rid of your name or you get rid of that scar on your arm?
Trust me,
you can't cut a scar out of here.
I've tried.
With all the houses that I owned,
that little room is the only place that I've called home.
But now you are rich and you have this image to maintain.
When I was a kid, I won scholarships in very expensive shools.
I was around a lot of very wealthy people.
So to fit in,
you felt like you had to make up your life.
Trust me, I know the feeling.
First, it was that my father bred racehorses instead of what he really did,
which was drive rich tourists around downtown in his horse and buggy.
Then that was my name.
The lies just snowballed.
Now it's too late for the truth.
Cindy, it's never too late for the truth.
Two tickets for the ... please.
Hi, I am your wife's gigolo.
Your wife had a deal for you.
''Let's celebrate your promotion, Jefferson Heights Roof
Cynthia''
Cynthia?
Cynthia?
This is great.
Cynthia?
Bad year for sulphur chloride.
What are you doing here?
I am celebrating, Frank.
Because today, you are fired.
What the hell are you...ah...
Hope you've brought your golden parachute.
Hold on, Frank.
You don't want to go down with your career.
Sulphur chloride.
Ideal for the demolishing of the building,
for murdering children.
God! Help me.
That you..down the public housing said it was the weather.
Right, Frank?
You killed a child,
just you could force people out of their homes,
just you could make more money.
You are crazy.
No, Frank.
You are.
This is about Michael Edwards down through to his death.
Just like you are about to do.
Help Me, Jarod.
I can't hold on much longer.
Like you helped Michael Edwards?
I have money!
Well, I didn't tell you, Frank. But I am not really a gigolo.
So I can't be bought.
But I am curious, how much?
How much to throw hundreds of people out of their homes?
How much to murder a innocent little boy?
Alright, Jarod. I did it.
Okay, I did it. Now, please, help me.
Nice watch.
Don't waste your time with those.
Trust me.
You really don't have to show a lady a good time, Jarod.
You haven't seen enough yet.
Hey, you!
You think he'll fly?
We'll see.
I am going to chase him.
Is that allowed?
I don't want to go back to that huge house by myself.
It gets really lonely.
Time is up.
Hey, what's happen to you? We are going over these renovation plans or what?
Whatever it takes.
Oh, I am coming...
What?
They say it is better to love and lost than never to love at all.
Do you believe that's true?
If you are lonely, call the nine hundred number.
Did you read my book?
I skimed through it.
You painted a pretty sad picture.
I just write the way I see it.
How do we be like this?
Like what?
Alone.
Searching.
It is ironic because we both want the same things.
Someone to care about.
Someone to care about us.
Do you think we'll ever find that kind of love in our lives?
What the hell do you want from me, Jarod?
Open the box.
''Be my valentine.''
''Gigolo Jarod''

Previously on the Pretender:
I have been thinking a lot about my mom lately.
Me too. Everyday.
I'm not like everyone else around here,
I am not afraid of your father.
Things haven't been the same since they arrived here.
You put a gun on me, no big deal.
Cos I know you don't have the rocks to pull the trigger.
You are going to shoot me?
Cafeteria closed?
Ah, Miss Parker.
Everyone's supposed to leave the Centre for today's fire security test.
Then why are you playing with matches?
I don't follow.
Hayes, if you're going to work for me,
you need to understand three things.
First, keep the tie straight.
Second,
get a new tie.
And the third?
Candy's for the clients.
- What?
- Ah, there you are sweetheart.
Daddy.
- Is that you?
- Well, unless you've got another father somewhere I don't know about.
Listen, I tried you at the house.
What are you doing at the Centre on a Sunday, especially this Sunday.
A false alarm on Jarod. Where are you?
About to get on a Centre helicopter.
I'll be at Blue Cove tonight.
But your vacation?
I didn't feel like laying around on a beach.
I couldn't forget what day this is.
I've been thinking a lot about your mother.
- You have?
- Surprised?
Um, ah, It's just that you've never called me like this on this day, I mean.
Well, when you get to where I am in life regrets start to eat you up.
There are lots of things that I've been meaning to say to you and to her for a long time.
I'm here, daddy, for you.
Ah, be there at seven, will you?
I was just leaving for the cemetery
but we could go and see mum together?
Yeah. For once there'll just, just three of us.
Wait for me.
I'll be at home. Daddy...
Mum, No... Mum, no.
I miss you, mum.
The anniversary of a parent's death can be a heavy cross to bear,
especially alone.
If you would like company at the cemetery?
Thanks but I won't be bearing a cross alone this year.
Your father?
I have visited my mother's grave every year
on the anniversary of her death
but my father would never talk about it.
Why is it people wait until the end of their lives before...
they...face regrets?
Regret is born of a parried emotion.
But your mother's death is a wound,
a wound that not even the Parkers can ignore forever.
You've never seen him grieve, have you?
Until you do,
until you can share your grief with him,
you will never heal.
Daughter...sad.
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Stealing office supplies?
Reviewing your past attempts to catch Jarod.
Not pretty.
Splash a little colour on, love.
So depressing.
- Daddy?
- Have you spoken to your father today?
What the hell do you want?
I want to help you.
- Where are you now?
- I'm leaving Blue Cove.
- What is it Jarod?
- Turn around and get back to the Centre as fast as you can.
Why?
Someone is going to kill your father.
There are pretenders among us
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-Six Hours, he has already demonstrated more talent than any of our others.
How many people died because of what I thought up?
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.
He is a pretender.
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.
He defends the weak and the abused.
Life is a gift.
THE PRETENDER
Season 2
Episode 12
Toy Surprise
YTET PRESENTS
DICTATION: ±ż±ż/´Đ´Đ
You are a doctor?
I am, today.
Someone has ordered your father's assassination.
My source says there's a file in the Centre's mainframe tagged ''Arkham''.
Apparently it explains everything.
Jarod, this is the wrong day for games.
I know what today is Miss Parker.
The Centre took your mother away from you
just like they took me away from mine.
Don't let them finish the job by killing your father.
My father kept you in the Centre your entire life, Jarod.
Why would you want to help him?
Because if he dies
my answers die with him.
And so do yours.
Jarod, I don't know about this.
Mr Compty, I've spoken with Chris's former counsellors.
We all agree. He's ready for this climb both physically and mentally.
I want to believe that hiking and mountain climbing are going to help
but ever since Chris's accident last year
we've tried therapists, retreats, vacations, everything.
I just want the old Chris back.
That's why I'm here.
He's just lost his best friend.
It takes time to heal from that kind of pain.
You spoke like a man who's experienced some loss himself.
I'm not giving up on your son without a fight.
Chris. Jarod Crockett.
We've got a tough trail ahead of us
if we're going to beat the others back to the base camp.
Are you ready to climb this monster?
I'm ready to go home.
The truth is I'd rather be home.
I'm missing my daughter's dance class.
The Arkham files, Broots. Focus.
It would a lot of easier to find if I could use my workstation.
I don't know why we can't use the tech room.
Because the tech room is the first place they would look.
Who? There's nobody here.
People trying to kill my father.
What?
- Oh God, I'm sorry.
- Now, you know what this is about.
Ok. Arkham.
- Have you been able to reach your father?
- His phone's dead.
So's the radio on the chopper.
He lands on the Tower's helipad in four hours.
Sydney when he called,
he...was reaching out to me.
Be careful, Parker.
He's disappointed you before.
Sydney, you were there the day that my mother was killed.
Did you ever see him...
Grieve over her?
Tell me.
Moments after she died, your father told me never to speak about it.
not to you, Jarod, anyone.
He ordered me back to work as if nothing had happened
Then...
What?
Then he said, life goes on.
Daughter sad.
Everyone sad.
Daughter sad.
This compass isn't working right.
I think we're lost.
I think you're right.
Whatever, it's not my fault.
You have to report positions to me.
We're a team out here. We have to communicate.
You guides are all the same.
Always trying to bug me out.
Bug you out?
Yeah, get me to communicate.
You want me to talk about stuff.
Back off. I don't need your help.
You don't have to go through this alone.
Just climb, ok?
Well, that might be easier than you think.
''Jeep is dead, I have gone ahead to station.''
You thinking what I'm thinking?
What?
Short cut.
We get this thing working.
We take the fire trail out of here
and we beat everybody to the cliff face.
I do not know.
Come on. We'll get done faster.
It'll be our little secret.
You're good with secrets, aren't you, Chris?
I got it! I got Arkham.
Arkham?
What are you doing here?
I live here.
You wheeze, I'll shoot you.
Ah, Miss parker?
- We've a little problem here.
- Open the file, Broots.
Ah, I can't. The files' like a doorbell on it
- and if I open it, a warning's going to be sent...
- Then whoever is behind this will know that we're here.
Ding dong. He already does. Do it!
Ah, it's encrypting.
It's turning into gibberish.
Did you see what it said?
Ah, neutralisation, ah, nineteen hundred hours...
Seven PM.
That's the exact time your father is due to land on the Tower helipad.
So it's true. They're going to murder my father.
I have no knowledge of this.
You son of a bitch.
I'd say we're all in the dark on this one, Miss Parker.
No computers. No phones. No power.
Doors are electronically sealed.
Sub-level lock down.
Designed to keep the Centre intact during a nuclear event.
Or a palace coup against my father.
Override the lock down.
lmpossible.
- If you think I'm going to sit here like one of your caged lab rats...
- I'm trapped too, Miss Parker.
My oxygen tank is almost empty.
Would I do that to myself?
Whoever is trying to kill your father now knows you're here.
And they'll come for you too.
Raines has a point.
Now, is it possible that the lock down has something to do with the fire security test?
There is no test you moron.
They wanted to clear the Centre.
Now I'm laying odds that Nosferatu has a sniper on the helipad.
I don't believe Raines had anything to do with this.
Wake up and smell the oxygen Syd.
He's behind everything.
Can you unlock the Arkham files?
Well, I...I've got them on disk. It will take a couple of hours, give or take.
I've got less than two and my father's dead, do you understand?
Easy Parker.
Broots is doing the best he can.
Could it be that the elevators have a back up power system?
Oh, Hayes.
- Who?
- My new sweaper.
Ah, I left him voice-mail after I called you two.
Now, his orders are to find me in the sim lab
if he hasn't heard from me within the hour.
Well, that's now. We're in the clear.
That's if he got the message.
Parker family motto. Never depend on anyone but yourself.
Give me the sim lab. This is Hayes.
Hello? Hello?
I'm unable to contact the Centre sir.
Keep trying.
Try it now.
Nah. We've got to push start it.
I'm going to pop the clutch. You give me a good push.
Think you've got it in you?
Yeah, whatever.
Ready?
- Jarod?
- My brakes!
Jarod.
Jarod.
Jarod.
Jarod.
Jarod. Jarod.
The Centre's original boiler system extends through every sub-level
right up to the lobby.
Damn!
Tragically ironic that all this is happening on the anniversary of your mother's suicide.
Murder.
And don't talk about her.
Please. Help me out of here.
I'll help you out of there.
Miss Parker.
Are you okay?
Why wouldn't I be?
I just haven't seen you in awhile, since...
since what happened to your mother.
She killed herself, Jarod.
She was sick.
What's his name?
They call him Angelo.
Sydney says he's special,
but I can't get through to him.
Maybe I can.
Cracker Jack?
You've never had them?
The snack with a toy surprise.
Why would someone want a surprise in their food?
Surprise.
You did it?
What about the elevator?
Oh, I've found some tools.
And look. These. Walkie talkies.
My father lands in ninety minutes. What about the Arkham file?
It'll take three hours at least.
Sounds like he's got even less.
I'd better stay with him. His pulse is bad.
Alright, if you don't hear from us in twenty minutes,
I want you to forget Mr Clean and get out.
You're my failsafe, Syd, in case we get nailed.
Wait. What do you mean nailed?
Back Broots.
Stay here.
Stop or you're dead!
Miss Parker.
Breathe now.
- Who? Who?
- Sweepers.
But I don't know either one.
Come on, Let's go.
Jarod? Jarod.
- What happened?
- You flipped the jeep.
- Is that hurt?
- Only when I blink.
I gotta get you out of here.
I think I broke my leg.
Chris, you have to go get help.
They're going to send a search.
I mean, when we don't show up, they're going to come looking for us.
Chris I could be bleeding internally. You have to go get help.
Just...just climb over that cliff.
There should be a road.
You can do it.
I cannot! I cannot!
Sydney, we're at the elevator.
What?
Oh. It's a bullet hole.
They haven't fixed that after all these years?
It's the Centre.
They're always trying to send a message.
Chris, you have to go get help.
God, Oh, my god.
Listen to me! You have to go get help.
No, I can't. No! I can't do that.
Yes. You can.
This is about your car accident, isn't it?
It's about how your best friend died.
You listen to me.
Accidents happen. People die.
- That is no secret.
- Why do you keep saying that?
Because I can help you, if you let me.
Let me help you.
Nick wanted to go for a shortcut that night.
He was going too fast.
We spun out and we hit a tree and jammed the steering wheel into him.
What happened?
And then the cops got there and his car was on fire
and I was outside and Nick was still inside.
Nick died instantly. You can't blame yourself for that.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. He didn't. I let him die.
I let him die.
You'll enjoy this.
I had one of those...
parental wakeup calls at breakfast,
you know, time sure flies.
My little Debbie tells me she knows what she wants to do in life.
She's ten.
Anyway, she says...
You ever think of getting out of here, Broots?
Excuse me?
The Centre. Leaving.
Taking Debbie and just going somewhere...else.
Yeah!
Actually lots of times.
Do it.
Don't worry about what other people think.
Don't buy into the false security of staying put.
If you think that's what you need to do, then do it.
Do it for Debbie.
and do it now
because the next elevator you get on...
I...I never knew your mother, Miss Parker
but I bet the choices she made
had everything to do with her little girl.
So what does Debbie want to do with her life?
She says she wants to be just like you.
Here we go. We're going to the lobby.
Wait for me.
Love.
I'm getting real sick of you.
You should not have searched the mainframe.
And where exactly are Broots and Sydney?
I thought Stooges travelled in threes.
By the way,
fire drills are for pyros and grade schoolers.
Can't blame a girl for trying.
If you were at the cemetery,
crying your little eyes out like you were supposed to be
you wouldn't be in this tricky little mess, now would you?
Don't you think it's time to turn off the faucet.
How appropriate for you to die in this elevator.
Just like mummy.
If there is one place that I'm not dying, it's here.
Miss Parker, you've been shot.
It's like a flesh wound. It must have been a ricochet.
Yeah, off my arm.
- You're bleeding pretty badly, Miss Parker.
- It is nothing.
No. Sit down.
Where the hell are we?
We are at SL-26.
Yeah, that's right.
Nice shot!
I hear something.
Wait! Wait! You're not going out there.
Here.
I want to kill her, not screw her.
Can you think of anything better?
I got your back.
Now I feel better.
Bet you never thought you'd get buried with a coward?
Is that what you are, Chris?
Is that what Nick would think of you?
What happened that night?
We were inside of the car.
I was upside down when I came to.
I looked over, Nick was stuck under the steering wheel.
There was blood everywhere.
He's looking over at me.
His eyes all scared.
They're begging me to help him.
And then the fire started coming in
the smoke.
I just sat there frozen.
I can still see his eyes.
What did you do?
I slid out of the car.
And I crawled away.
Then the flames grew bigger.
I could hear his voice calling me from the fire.
I should've burned, Jarod.
I should have died.
Nick was pinned inside that car. You couldn't have saved him if you wanted to.
Because I ran away.
If you had stayed in that car, you would have died.
Your response was human.
I ran away!
I know what loss is like.
I watched my brother die in a car accident.
Not a day goes by that I don't blame myself
that I don't think of something that I could've done.
As time went by
he forgave me.
I hear his voice inside of me.
Just like you hear Nick's.
What would he want you to do now?
Wait, Miss Parker. Careful. Did you hear that sound?
Oh! I'm officially in hell.
Give me that walkie.
Angelo.
Broots, how's the Arkham file coming?
- Two hours.
- Great.
My father lands in one.
You gotta get me back to the lobby, Broots.
Tasty.
Tasty.
Daughter
sad.
You miss your mother, don't you?
She used to give me these.
It's just me and my daddy now.
But he's always working.
My mum and I used to talk about things.
She would brush my hair
or we'd read together.
My mum's gone too.
I talk to her though.
Her voice is inside of me
just like your mother's is inside of you.
Mum. They're trying to hurt mum.
Daddy. Trying to hurt Daddy.
Daughter sad.
Wait! What are you...
Don't touch that.
He's speeding it up.
- Golden Hawk down.
- What?
There's no sniper. She's sabotaged the helicopter.
Golden Hawk down.
It's a distance sensitive triggering device.
- A what?
- A triggering device.
As soon as the helicopter gets within a hundred feet of the tower
an explosive device goes off.
The helicopter loses control and crashes.
But it looks like an accident.
Exactly.
Toy surprise.
I told you I don't want any!
Ah. Surprise.
It is a DSA.
And it's dated the day of my mother's death.
Where is Jarod?
He's been taken to his space, Mr Parker.
What happened to Catherine?
My wife was very sick.
Troubled, yes.
But suicide?
You'll never discuss this incident with anyone.
Ever.
Not with Jarod
and especially not with my daughter.
Go home, now!
I want you back in this laboratory tomorrow,
ready to work.
Life goes on, Sydney.
Life goes on.
Daddy sad.
Must save Daddy.
Let's finish this.
The boiler hatch should be right over there.
Parker, where are you?
We're at SL-26 heading for the boiler.
You've got to hurry, your father lands in less than thirty minutes.
Tell me something I don't know.
Miss Parker! Up there!
The boiler goes all the way up to the lobby.
Let's hope I'm not too late.
Everything's in place.
Thirty minutes until Centre airspace and the triggering point.
You ready?
Yeah I think I am.
Jarod.
Hurry back.
- Maybe I should go with you?
- No, I can move faster alone.
Wow. Twenty-six floors in fifteen minutes.
Are you sure you're ok to do this?
- Do you remember the code to the power bunker?
- I've got it, Broots.
Good luck.
Yes.
Syd, I'm in the lobby. Hayes is dead.
Raines isn't far behind.
I'm plugging him into the Centre's oxygen system.
Get the power on.
- Put the walkie to his ear.
- We don't have time, Parker.
Do it!
Are you trying to kill my father?
No.
Who is?
The same people who killed your mother.
Who?
He's blacking out!
Miss Parker, you have got five minutes.
The Centre's in sight. It'll be good to be home.
Hello, love!
You don't give up, do you?
Drop the accent. Nobody's buying it any more.
Fine with me bitch. Too much damn work anyway.
That's the problem with you Parkers.
You never finish what you started.
You look finished to me.
You okay?
Yeah! Nick would be proud.
I know, he told me.
Thank you.
Son, your dad's waiting for you.
Bye.
''Teen Dies in Weekend Accident: A Friendship is Shattered''
Sorry for the false alarm but it was for a good cause.
But your leg is broken.
I eat a lot of ice cream. Calcium.
It's good for you.
Bridget will be dealt with.
I want you to know.
Let's not talk about that now.
God, It's...it's beautiful here.
You've never been back?
Not since the burial.
I couldn't bring myself to face her.
From now on, every year we come here, together.
There are things I've wanted to say...
You don't have to say anything Daddy.
It's just good to have you back.
Are you ok?
Life goes on.
- Parker.
- I'm glad your father is alright.
Thank you,Jarod.
You miss her?
Yes.
She misses you too.
How can you be so sure?
Read the card.
''Her voice is inside you.''

I swear to God,
I am starting to lose my mind.
It's bad enough that we've missed Jarod with all the close calls that we had.
But we are not even showing up in the right citys any more.
We'll get back on track, Miss Parker. We're just in a slump.
This is the Center, Broots.
We don't have ''slumps''.
What?
Well, well, well.
Long time no see.
And how was life treating you?
But you caught me in bed with his wife.
What do you want, Jarod?
Why is Mr. Lyle tailing me?
Mr. Lyle.
Yes, he chased me through Albuquerque and in Santa Fe.
Although I don't see much hitchhiking in his future.
Hitchhiking?
Somebody cut off one of his thumbs.
Jarod.
I think you should tell us where you are.
We can protect you from him.
Although I really do appreciate your concern, I've got certainly used to taking care of myself.
Well, I really got to go.
I am late for work.
Hey, Joey.
Who is this?
He is a new guy.
- So, we set?
- My money.
Bobbie?
A beautiful thing, huh?
Plates will be here in three days. Take it easy.
What's this?
It's like a round pig
in a square hole.
You just don't fit.
Joey, corpse means cops.
Yeah, a live witness means trouble.
Sorry.
I came through with the counterfeit plates.
I got what you wanted.
Come on, shoot him. It's freezing in here.
Joey, these ain't smart.
You know he is right.
You do it.
Come on, man, show me what you got.
Do it!
Do it!
Alright, punch your ticket.
They don't call Bobbie Two-Guns for nothing.
These ain't right, Joey.
Alright, alright, but at least take him out to the docks.
No... Do it here.
Come on, Chicago boy.
Joey, I got kids.
- Say pray for them.
- I got a family, Joey, I mean, come on!
No, don't!
Shoot him!
Do it! Do it! Do it!
There are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent then any of our others.
How many people died because of what I thought up?

DICTATION: ±ż±ż/´Đ´Đ
You are a doctor?
I am today.
- Breakfast?
- Yeah, let's get out of here. It stinks.
Hey, quite a marksman there ..
Nice shot.
''Body Found In Warehouse''
- Jarod.
- What's up?
Hey, how we do last night?
I don't know, Joey. Only about nine hundred and change.
What?
It rained.
Hey, Bobbie.
Make sure it is sent by ten o'clock, alright?
I don't want another phone call.
- I got to pay the rent.
- So pay it.
Hey, hey, give me aback.
Hey.
Let's talk in my office.
I love what's you done with the place.
(FBl) can't pick up our conversation because of the frost.
Look, if this is about what happened yesterday,
you caught me off guard, it will not happen again.
Oh, it was just a test.
You know, you definitely not make a full use of your talents.
In fact Tony says, you are the best ''print man'' he has ever seen.
A real artist, he says.
Well, I've printed him a million dollars.
Not saying anything.
So show me.
Excuse me.
Come on, let's see what you got.
Which one is real?
They are both real.
Guess I am an artist.
You really think I wouldn't find out who you are.
What the hell are you talking about?
Tell me again. Once again. What happened in Chicago?
I told you, I was a ''print man'' for Tony T.
What's this? Look at this.
Jarod Puzo.
Outstanding convictions for arson,
extortion, fraud,
outstanding warrantsˇ­you want me to continue?
Alright....
I jump bail.
I want it to lay low for a while.
The last thing I needed was some punk making his bones by ratting me out.
Ok.
A few months back, couple of FBls infiltrated our organisation.
- That's not good.
- Yeah.
A friend of mine says they could spin everybody.
Well, if you will remember, all that occurred before I got here.
Yeah. You got an answer to everything, don't you?
No more secrets, alright?
Artist.
''Federal Undercover Officer Found Murdered''
''Fellow Officer Charged in Slaying''
''Father Disgraced By Son's Indictment''
Your secretary said it was urgent.
I've got this surveillance tape of Satellite from Hartford office.
Oh, my god. Do you know the shooter?
I think we both do.
Mr. Lyle.
Jarod contacted us, said Lyle's been dogging him.
Last report was he was dealing with Japanese Yakusa.
Definitely Yakusa.
The Yakusa punish by taking a little finger of the offending party.
What's the guy have to do to lose a thumb?
Couldn't have a nice fellow.
Question is, how was the bustard up to?
I know all the Center office is monitored.
Disable the primary, the shots were from the backup units.
Well, you know, all our people there are dead.
Including the executive administrator, Mr. Strumps.
Lyle.
I want you to Hartford to clean up the mess.
I am not a cleaner any more.
My job is to find Jarod.
You said Lyle was after Jarod,
makes this your job.
Somebody has to find out what else he was after.
This is a ˇ­
very delicate situation.
You are the only person I can trust.
Undercover agent Dean Clark was ringed today in the killing of Federal Officer Lester Knight.
Our reporter caught up with Sean Flanagan, the US prosecutor who's trying the case.
You said ... that agent Dean Clark killed Federal undercover agent Knight?
Agent Clark has been charged for the homicide connection with the death of a fellow agent.
They are both working undercover for the Molino crime family.
I told the department not to say this time.
''Father Disgraced By Son's Indictment''
He is the reason I joined RICO. I would never do anything to disgrace him.
You said you were drinking with an associate of Joey Molino at the night Lester Knight was murdered.
Yeah.
Bobbie Two-Guns. Molino's secondary command.
They call him Two-Guns because he carries his match of thirty-eights.
I told my lawyer that. Don't you guys in the Public Defenders Office talk to each other?
So you were with this Bobbie the night that agent Knight was murdered.
My assignment undercover was to take off Two-Guns.
He was hanging out at Faye's restaurant, ... me to go head to head with a bottle of gin.
So, I started drinking, be assing.
I got a call from agent Knight.
He said someone was feeding RICO information to Molino.
- Did he say who?
- No.
He said ''watch my back in the middle of the morning.''
The same morning that agent Knight was found suffocated in a dry cleaner's bag?
The same dry cleaner's that you used.
I was set up.
Bobbie and I, polished off a quarter gin.
I didn't even remember leaving Faye's.
There is no way I could have driven over the bridge ... Knight's,
kill him and make it back home without running my car into a pole.
I am telling you I was set up.
The counterfeit plates come from Costa Rica.
Two sizes: twenty's, hundred's.
You have some work.
You are an artist.
I am getting to need the right materials.
- You know the suppliers?
- Of course.
- How much gonna cost?
- Hey, don't worry about that.
This deal goes down, everybody is getting fat.
Hey, Joey, you got a call.
- Who is it?
- I don't know. You want me to ask?
No, just give me the phone.
Hey, Faye, bring me Gibson.
I'll be right back.
Is that Waikiki?
Yeah. You can see the Diamond Head in the background.
It is beautiful.
I suppose to go there on my honeymoon.
Got put off.
So, Faye, so nice girl like you don't want a place like this.
I can't afford to move to Hawaii.
Seriously, like this, sell this place and go.
Joey, he sucked this place dry.
I've got no equity.
How did you link up with a guy like Joey?
My husband died and left me the restaurant.
I tried to make a go of it, but ran into some money trouble.
Joey said he could help. Woo, big mistake.
Hey, Faye, let's go.
You are the one who should get away from him,
while you still can.
- What happens to them?
- Nothing. They don't exist any more.
It has been a while since you work as a cleaner, Miss Parker, I am surprised.
My father has his reasons.
- What are we looking for?
- Anything that seems out of place or missing.
Lyle wouldn't pour out the heap like this unless this must be important.
This got to be something around here.
What is this?
Ah, this is an E-prong chip.
- Most likely ..in the Blue Box.
- Blue Box?
Each Center office has a dedicated hardware system from the mainframe,
called the Blue Box.
But, chips like this just couldn't fall off.
Blue Box is sealed shut.
Like this?
Yeah, that would be it.
What's up?
A friend of my friend tells me that ten pallets of raw currency paper being stored in a warehouse in Brooklyn for one night.
Tonight.
Wow.
You want to rob of the treasury department?
With uncle sam's paper,
no one but no one is going to be able to tell our bills,
from the real deal.
Hey.
Picasso didn't paint on toilet paper, did he?
Trust me.
Did I say something funny?
''Trust me.''
That's the last thing Lester Knight said to me, standed right where you are.
You slew that RICO cop here?
We locked him right where you are standing.
I thought he gonna freeze to death but he suffocated first.
I lost fifty bucks to Two-Guns on that bet.
But hey, dead is dead, right?
I thought he had a dry cleaning bag wrapped around his head.
I did that, to frame another RICO cop.
I am an artist too, you know.
Hi, Picasso, set it up.
You will get enough paper to print a billion bucks.
Have a big go, Picasso!
Yeah, baby.
- Security shift changes in twenty, let's move.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we got to go. The cops come.
How do you know this?
Trust me, I know.
Come on, let's move. Come on.
Come on, get out of here, come on.
Put the hands up. Get them right from here.
Stop the run.
Right there.
...
Get your hands off of me!
- You take Bobbie onboard.
- Did you have to get me in nose?
They shouldn't ... to take a bullet.
Best to know there's someone smelled like cat-food for at least a month.
How long have you been staying in that fish bath?
Let's just say the dry cleaner was not my business any more.
No, no, no, leave them on.
The more bruises, the less questions they are going to ask.
Jarod, we put a lot of pressure on people of Chicago to ..for you.
Now if you think Joey .., we pull you out right now.
We don't want to lose another undercover agent.
I am too close to bear out now.
So why did you set up this phony bust?
Molino seems to know everything before we do.
Looking for a link.
And?
And, he gets a phone call. And he takes off before you guys get there.
Could be a coincidence?
No.
There is a rat on the ship.
It's a big one.
Look, this wasn't a rag merchan you morons boosted
It was the US treasury department.
I told you already.
We were going to meet some friends and we went to the wrong warehouse.
Flanagan, we got a couple of wags who got their brains dead
How can you tell?
Now, who look stupid?
Us, or the guys who lost two undercover cops?
You guys know what you are looking at?
Twenty years.
Funny. That's what Dean Clark is looking at.
Must be a real disappointment for you, fellows.
You don't get it real in the morning.
The chance of putting Joey Molino away forever.
So you guys get wise crack all you want.
This time, I win.
The game is not over yet.
You can't be serious.
Molino's lawyer is in Judge Driger's chambers.
Apparently somebody forgot to read these gentlemen their rights.
What?
Oops.
Cut them loose.
Cut them loose?
You heard me.
It looks like this time you lose.
Well, I made a diagnosis. There is definitely certain chip missing.
Isn't there any way of determining what sort of information was stored on?
It's impossible to know what's on it, more specifically what's not.
Nothing is impossible.
Keep working.
So what happened at the warehouse?
The friend of the friend set it up.
Turns out it had a poor violation.
So with plan both ends against middle,
so we would have to go back to start.
Look, no things can turn out one hundred percent.
But we got enough paper to make a score.
And the friend of the friend?
Let's just say that he won't be talking to anyone any more.
And I'm mailing his wife a liitle present.
Is that a tongue?
Look, the paper we got is good.
So everything is gonna be okay.
I am counting on it.
- Oh, Bobbie.
- Yeah.
- I got you something too.
- What? The guy's brains?
Something better.
A little congrats for getting out of jail.
That is your drink, right?
I can't believe this guy.
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.
All the panels and all the blue boxes,
contain sensitive information,
could jeopardize the operations if falling on the wrong hands.
Lyle obviously knew it. He could get a price from one of these panels.
Set himself up, make him move back into the Center.
So this time he has to be dealt with full finality.
Situation has to be cleaned, but has to play close to the best.
You want me to set it up?
Daddy?
I am not an assassin.
You are sure you do the right thing.
It's taking a lot of manuring to rebuild my position here.
And Lyle's reappearance make me look inefficient.
Daddy.
Angel, it's about us protecting each other.
If you don't protect me,
I can't protect you.
I am going home,
and finish my present.
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Later.
Hey, Nicky, give me a ride, alright?
Can I get you something else?
I'll have vodka and rocks, if you join me.
- Twist my arm.
- Let me get it.
No, no. Not that. Joey waters it down, I keep the good stuff back in the freezer.
Oh...Waitˇ­wait a minute.
No, thank you, I will pass.
I don't want drink anything that comes from the place where, you know, the cop died.
What are you talking about?
Joey told me how they ..the RICO cop in the deep freeze.
Oh, my god.
You didn't know.
That was the night Joey had me shut the place down early.
I just thought...
I had no idea they killed someone.
What about Dean Clark? You know that undercover cop that was charged of the murder of Lester Knight,
Is he here that night?
He was in the bar, he was drinking gin with Bobbie.
He was so plastered they had to carry him out of here.
Are you okay?
I am just pulling my head out of the sand.
One cop is dead.
And an innocent one is going to be executed for it.
Hell!
How did I get here?
And how do I get out?
Central records please.
Yes, this is officer 557E.
I'd like to get a copy of all the requests made in the last two days for a rap sheet on one Jarod Puzo.
Yes, I'll hold.
Who?
Thank you. That's all the information I need.
You can't take it all. I need change for the customers.
Keeps all ... , Faye,
your head'll wind up on the wall next to your Hawaii shot.
I don't believe this.
What did you say?
Hey, hey, Joey, Joey,
the customers.
You want the money to keep coming in this place, don't you?
Where is Bobbie?
He didn't come in today.
He has married to the toilet.
So much drunk.
Mush.
I'll suppose to be across town.
I can make the delivery for you.
No one will be late with the gift.
Alright.
- Make suer it'll be there by ten o'clock.
- Not a problem.
I don't want to get a phone call.
Good evening, Mr. Flanagan.
Where is Bobbie?
Plumbing problems.
You are the white ass in the interview room.
First impressions can be so misguided.
You tell Joey,
if he wants our arrangements to continue,
I would need more money.
The people have to be paid.
- I understand.
- Good.
Just make sure you do.
No doubt about it.
Make sure that Broots takes focus on finding Jarod.
You know how he is.
We need proof for what happens on ADD goes on diagnosed.
What did he ask you to do?
I tell Broots what to do.
Your father.
It doesn't matter.
I don't believe you, Parker.
Lyle shows up and suddenly you are a cleaner again for one job.
What did your father ask you to do ?
He wants me to handle the situation.
To kill him?
Lyle has come in whatever he has come in.
You sound like you actually believe it.
I do.
What?
What's the name of it?
Lyle has been located in a hotel in Providence.
What are you going to do about it, Parker?
To go and to handle the situation.
And then?
And then I am gonna go home and sleep like a baby.
Check.
Mate.
I warned you.
- That seat's taken.
- Eugene Clark?
Maybe.
I am a friend of Dean's.
You are a wise guy.
You got some nerve coming here like this.
I think it's agaist the law to hit a federal agent.
A federal agent? You worked with Dean?
No.
But I know he respects you.
He would never do anything to hurt you.
Look, I am not a father.
But I am a son, and I know,
the feelings that a son has.
Wanting to grow up like his father.
Wanting to make him proud.
I used to think that was Dean.
But last three months, I've been wrecked my brain wondering where I went wrong.
You did the best you could.
I got to go.
Mr. Clark.
Dean is a good cop.
Don't give up on him.
Lyle has been located in a hotel in Providence.
What are you going to do about it, Parker?
What are you going to do about it?
This time he has to be dealt with full finality.
What are you going to do about it?
I am not an assassin.
This time he has to be dealt with full finality.
Full finality.
Finality.
What are you going to do about it?
I am not an assassin.
You're sure you do the right thing....
- Yes.
- So close and yet so far.
That's become some one of an anthem for you, hasn't it?
- Mr. Lyle.
- Don't be disappointed, Miss Parker.
You can't catch Jarod, what chance you to get with me?
You sound like you're catching a cold, it must be dark and wet where you are.
That's temporary condition.
We want the computer chip.
I can't do that. Now that I want to keep the rest of my ..
If you excuse me, I've got a running with a very anxious buyer.
Twenty million dollars, Miss Parker.
God bless me the American Dream!
You got something behind.
You've reached Hillman Marine. At the present, no one is availablt to take your call.
Our normal business hours are from...
- Broots.
- You have ever heard a place called ''Hillman''?
Oh, yes, in Connecticut. It's where the Center's data backup warehouse is located.
The what?
Every friday night at eleven fifty-nine PM,
all the Center mainframe from all across country do this mass computer backup,
and to this giant system from the Blue Boxes.
Boxes.
You think Lyle is trying to infiltrate the warehouse?
Can you think of a reason why he would?
It's how he could decrypt it.
What are you talking about?
The semiconduct panel he stole is encrypt. The code's impossible to break.
But if he were able to input this panel into the warehouse mainframe,
at eleven fifty-nine PM,
on...tonight!
Tonight, when the backup occurs,
it will automatically decrypt,
whatever information is on it.
What is how he gets twenty million for it.
Twenty million?
Man, crime does pay.
Alright, listen, is it located by a river, a lake, the ocean, something like that?
A river, yeah.
He rented a boat.
He does his business, he runs out to ... he escapes in a boat.
Unlessˇ­
Unless I make sure he doesn't.
Plates came in. They've been delivered this afternoon.
Excellent. Have them sent here.
Here?
Yeah.
Who is gonna surprised when we shut this dump down?
We print the money here and we'll torch the place.
What about Faye?
We can't leave any witnesses, can we?
''Hillman Marine''
Midnight stroke.
How did you find me?
I hit redial.
This is always the simple thing, isn't it?
The chip.
You know, twenty million dollars but two wages
apparently out of the question.
Why followed Jarod if this is what you wanted?
That was payoff the debt.
Jarod is to win friends and influence people.
I bring the man, all is forgivable.
The Center welcomes ...
We'll see.
So they sent you to clean up?
- Really gonna kill me?
- That's up to you.
Then why are you still talking about it?
It isn't as easy as it looks, is it?
You know why you don't want to kill me?
Because you are me.
It is natural desire for poeple like us to dominate the fine.
You and I have nothing in common.
We bo...
We both recognise,
that this notion of human equality just perpetuates mediocrity.
But we are not mediocrity.
Are we, Miss Parker?
We are independent.
And independence,
is the privilege of the strong.
Tell me, Miss Parker.
How strong are you?
Strong enough.
How strong are you?
Test me.
Nice working with you.
Yeah.
Mr. Flanagan? I hold a restaurant called Jax.
How did you get this number?
Some friends of yours are over there now setting you up to take a big fall.
I hope you remember this call if I need help in the future.
- Yeah.
- There were some cops hanging around the bar.
Cops?
I overheard one say Flanagan was going to set you up for a big fall tonight.
I thought you should know.
What the hell is this?
Turn around slowly and put your pistol on the pool table.
So what the hell is ( cellophane!)
And why you get to pay extra afford anyway?
What is this?
I just thought you'd like to see how Lester Knight looked, after you and Joey killed him.
Who are you?
Turn around and walk.
Get in it.
You are a dead man,Jarod.
You hear me, you are dead.
Woo, you need a chill out.
It's look cramp in there.
lmagine how Dean Clark must feel in his cell.
You are a RICO.
Did you know about this?
What you think!
Well the truth is I am not really a cop or a mobster.
It's sort of complicated.
Now each of you is responsible for the murder of Lester Knight.
So I thought it will be really need if you feel like he felt.
Listen, Jarod.
- It wasn't my idea about...
- Shut up, Joey.
Shut up.
Lester Knight found about Flanagan and Flanagan bumped him off.
Yeah, you dumped the body and then you framed Dean Clark.
Listen, Jarod, I'll give anything you want.
Actually you've just given me everything I need.
Jarod, please. You just you can't leave me in here and die.
It doesn't really matter if you freeze,
or you suffocate.
Like you say,Joey.
Dead is dead.
- Hey.
- Jarod, no.
- Dead is dead. You are dead.
It is a mess, Miss Parker.
No head. One of his arms, both of his legs are missing.
I'm guessing he got chewed up by the prop of a very large boat.
But it is him.
Thumb is got away.
Mr. Lyle.
Put a gun on you.
And made the choice for you.
I'll see you later.
Miss Parker.
Will you be alright?
I'm just tired, Syd. I am gonna go home to bed.
And I am feeling I am going to sleep like a baby.
I ...on that semiconduct chip before Raines had it confiscated.
It contained codes.
It is a computer chip, Broots.
No, no, no. I don't think you understand.
It contained genetic codes.
Genetic codes?
- Yeah.
- For what?
I think the properer question will be ''for whom''?
And?
I am not a geneticist.
I just can't help wondering if it has...
it's something to do with Jarod.
How is my angel?
There were genetic codes on that stolen panel.
Don't worry about. That's not important.
Important enough to have me killed a man.
Well, he is the enemy.
You did the right thing.
For who?
Smell like a cleaner..can't ..this life.
Let's rest, angel. You look like a hell.
It's a joke.
After you testify in court,
and all those blows over,
send me a postcard from Hawaii.
Hawaii? I don't even have enough money to get to Jersey.
You do now.
Where did this come from?
Joey's private account.
All the money he took from you.
Plus interest.
Who are you really?
An artist.

Wait a minute, I didn't do anything.
Wait! I didn't do anything.
- What, what the hell is that?
- Move it!
No.
I want to call my father!
Do you hear me?
Nice PJs!
They pulled me right out of bed.
I was in the shower.
Hmm! Thanks for painting that one for me.
What the hell is going on here?
Trouble.
The worse kind.
I thought you were leaving town.
Well, I came to say goodbye, Sharpton.
And I knew you'd be here.
Like you are every night.
Collecting your payoff.
Same bat time, same bat channel.
I heard that on a re-run.
I don't know what you are talking about.
Every night you head out alone,
you make your run,
collecting your drug money.
Then one night you hit a little girl.
You couldn't stop because of all the contrabands you had on board,
so you let her to bleed to death.
Tell me, what you are going to do about it?
I'm going to make sure that this is your last run.
You got it all down pat don't ya.
Well, you're right.
I do deliver drugs and I do love my money.
And I do head out alone.
But you left out a little something.
What's that?
The part where I stop and pick up my partner.
Come on, we're going to be late.
He'll freeze to death out here.
Yeah. It's a rough world, ain't it?
There are pretenders among us
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-Six Hours, he has already demonstrated more talent than any of our others.
How many people died because of what I thought up?
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.
He is a pretender.
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.
He defends the weak and the abused.
Life is a gift.

DICTATION: ±ż±ż/´Đ´Đ
You are a doctor?
I am, today.
Hey, wait!
Don't twitch or the dog'll rip the Adam's apple clear out of your throat.
Won't you?
Don't get me wrong.
He's a good-looking dog but that dog was born mean.
He did save your life however.
Found you in a parking lot.
Near barked his head off until I found ya.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Ah there you go.
Hey, what're you looking at?
You got something to add to this?
Why don't you get out of here and go back to your bed.
Go on.
No. No...
Don't try getting up, don't try getting up.
You need to just stay right there and rest.
You got smashed pretty hard.
You just rest. You need to rest. You need to rest. You just rest.
What happened?
What happened?
Oh, Ah, You my friend have been mugged.
And oh no, they got all your money.
I'm, I'm sorry.
All your money's gone.
That's bad but your stuff is safe.
I saved your stuff.
That's good.
Where am I?
Where are you?
You my friend are in my little corner of paradise.
At least for now.
Hey, hey, ah, my name's Argyle by the way.
My name's Argyle.
And I'm called this on account of this birthmark that I got on the back of my thigh.
You want to see it?
You want to check it out?
No? Okay! That's cool.
Most people don't.
No offence taken.
You got a lot of stuff in here, dude.
Hey, I hope my patch job keeps in the blood, okay,
because look, the dog never complained about the doctoring.
But hey, I think you'd be the better judge you being the real M.D. and all.
- Doctor?
- Yeah.
You're a doctor, my friend.
This Id here says that your name is Jarod
and you, my friend, are a thoracic surgeon.
Give me a 3 cc syringe and a size A ET tube.
She's going into respiratory arrest.
Prepare to ventilate.
Give me the syringe. Remove the plunger.
Air entry on both sides of the chest.
She's pinking out.
Now that's a nice sound.
Come on. Come on. Yes! Yeah baby.
Now that's a nice sound.
We're gonna have us some heat now.
Oh. Oh.
Nothing ever works in this place.
Including you.
Never!
That's all going to change.
That's all going to change. Real soon!
I'm thinking four years of college.
I'm thinking Medical School.
I'm thinking doctoring prescriptions.
You know, I've been riding a wooden pony for years now.
And I'm thinking, you might just be my brass ring.
Brass Ring?
Pot of gold, boy, ship that's come in.
The way out man.
I'm thinking the hospital'll pay a healthy finders fee for one of it prize physicians.
Not a doctor.
You're not a doctor?
Come on. Who, the hell, are you then?
I don't know.
What is this?
It's a T-board.
A what? What?
T standing for torture.
The Centre Tribunal.
They want answers and until they get them we're not going anywhere.
Well, no. You're kidding right?
Don't soil yourself, Broots.
They want us unbalanced.
That's why they yanked us in the dead of night.
They're trying to fracture us emotionally.
Well, it's working. I'm shattering.
How do you know so much about this?
I've been on the other side of the glass.
So how does it turn out?
Fine.
If you're on the other side of the glass.
Oh great!
I knew Raines would be involved.
The question is who's behind it all.
The Triumvirate, cruskin.
Under whose authority?
Bridget!
That bitch is like a bad cough.
Who are those guys in the shadows?
I don't know.
I need to get word to my father.
Here.
I'm not sure that he will be able to help.
Sydney!
Hello lovey!
Bridget.
The last time I saw you,
you were trying to blow my father's helicopter out of the sky.
How did you get back in the Centre?
Well, before we get to that,
I promised some friends of mine I'd find out
why after eighteen months, Jarod is still out there.
Not possible.
They created him.
They know what he's capable of.
Yes, they do.
They think, the only way that he could still be eluding the Center
is that one, or all of you, are working with him.
They think that?
Or you made them think that?
Either way, no one's leaving until we find out who.
We start with you, Tex.
Whoever you are, you've got a tooth sweeter than mine, that's for sure.
Sugar's a killer, you know that?
It will rot all the teeth out, right out of your head.
I'm lucky. I'm blessed. I've really good teeth.
They're all mine.
Hey, buddy?
What's wrong?
Oh no.
You don't know who you are and you're burning up.
That's what happens when you're left out in the elements.
That's what happens.
Your problem was you weren't looking over your shoulder.
You always gotta look over your shoulder, man.
There's always somebody back there in the dark,
Some mook, some punk back there gunning for you, I know.
You gotta look over your shoulder, man.
Look over your shoulder.
Or maybe you're running away from this cutie pie.
Who's this?
Hey
Who's this pretty lady?
What did she do?
Bust your rocks for not bringing home the green.
Hey, you didn't bring home the green.
Maybe she's another doctor.
You know, you'd better think twice about that next time.
Well, I'll be John Brown.
I will be John Browned.
You're not a doctor.
You're a park ranger.
No, you're a fireman.
No, you're a roach exterminator.
No, you're a federal investigator.
I'm, I'm sorry, mister.
Could you help me out here for a second?
I'm kind of at a loss here.
Who the hell are you?
Mister?
Mister?
I don't know who I am.
I didn't do anything.
Broots scared.
How do you think he will hold up?
Before or after he wets his pants?
Can I, Can I have a robe?
Is Jarod smarter than you?
- Huh?
- You've been chasing him for over a year.
Has he alluded you because he is smarter?
No.
We try hard every day to find Jarod
but the wheel of fortune just hasn't landed on our number yet.
Spinning, spinning, spinning.
Well, he is a Pretender.
He's a one-man Siegfried and Roy.
Show me what you have.
Jarod interconnected 173 international calls.
But backtracking those calls was impossible
because instead of a call forwarding device triggered by a single call
all one hundred and seventy-three calls was individually initiated.
- Ingenious.
- And very expensive.
I don't care what it cost.
Oh, that's good because Jarod charged them all to your calling card.
He's, he's clever and smart.
Which makes tracking Jarod more fun.
Fun?
No! I...
Are you saying he's your hero?
No. I'm... No, I'm not saying that.
Then what are you saying?
Just... I'm just saying that Jarod's clever.
You can see it in his eyes.
You can tell.
According to your file you've never laid eyes on Jarod.
You never have, have you?
No.
I, ah, I'm referring to pictures.
Hello, Mr Broots.
Oh, my God!
Help me, please.
Eighteen months, no results.
We find it hard to believe that someone could be this inept on purpose.
Help me...
Mr Broots!
If you're not helping Jarod then who is?
Can I have a robe please?
You're like you and me.
Bunch of names. Travel light. Man on the run.
Who are you running from anyway?
John Law.
The man with a smile on his face and the evil in his heart? Huh?
Who you running from?
Hey.
Maybe you got a bounty on your head?
Your head's burning up.
You're burning up, man.
Oh no. This is not good.
You've been out in the elements too long man.
Out in the elements too long.
I knew it. This is not good.
I knew it. This is bad.
Jarod! Jarod!
I love you, Jarod.
Don't leave me.
Please don't leave me.
Come on!
Hey! Hey! Are you okay, man?
Are you okay?
No! No! No, don't you die on me, man.
Don't you die on me! Don't you leave me!
You're my brass ring man!
Come on! Don't you die on me, man!
Don't you die on me, man!
I know the escape procedure.
The fire! It's too hot!
It comes into the airline.
I try not to breathe but it is too late.
I can't open the hatch.
I can't open the hatch!
No one can get to us.
We can't be saved.
I'm burning! I'm burning! I'm burning! I'm burning!
Hey! Your fever broke.
Doubt left you with me for a while.
So, what's the Centre?
Your your little freakish home movies are all labelled ''For Centre Use Only. ''
What's the Centre?
I don't know.
You don't know!
I...I'll tell you what I think, Jarod.
I think that you got a big brain.
And I think that these Centre guys, I think they're after you.
And I think that means you're worth something to them,
which means you're worth a lot to me.
You see I got a big brain too.
Jarod, I got a big brain too.
Why won't you work?
Why won't you work?
Why won't you work?
I'm just trying to fix things, Jarod.
I'm just trying to make them right.
Not a big deal.
No big deal.
Just trying to fix things.
Who are you?
The proudest woman in the world.
Who am I?
Just trust your feelings.
Always trust your feelings.
Jarod, I told you I can't accept this.
But I made it for you.
This card is meant for someone else.
Don't you love me, Sydney?
We have work to do.
Is Sydney your dad or something?
I'm so glad I left Debbie at her god mother's.
I can't believe how long they've had Sydney out there.
You wear a watch to bed?
Yeah.
Why?
In case I wake up and, you know, need to document something.
Let us continue.
When are they going to leave him alone?
When they hear what they want to hear.
He's been out there for six hours already.
And they'll take another six if they want to.
What are they doing this for?
Because they can.
Jarod is my life's work.
My interest in him is primarily scientific.
That interest demands that I remain objective
which precludes the possibility of guilt.
Don't you love me, Sydney?
Forgive me father for I have sinned.
I have betrayed a friend.
Have you prayed to the Lord?
Not even he can forgive me for what I have done.
The bond between Jarod and me is as unique as Jarod is special.
Unique enough for you to be fighting for his freedom.
I would never do that.
Jarod's a very complex case.
I've tried to keep him alive
and to hold his psyche in check during this pursuit.
What are you? His wet nurse?
We must be patient.
Your tactics are far too aggressive.
The day you really anger Jarod is the day that he will disappear forever.
I have tried to bring him back.
That is my objective.
As a scientist,
I think The Centre is as good a place
as he will find to maximise his tremendous potential.
You don't know who Jarod is.
You don't know who Jarod is...
You're not a doctor. You're a park ranger.
No, you're a fireman.
No, you're a roach exterminator.
No, a federal investigator.
I'm sorry, mister. Who the hell are you...
- How are you?
- I can be anything I want to be.
I can be a doctor, I can be an engineer, I can be an astronaut.
But I don't know who I am.
Our father gave you this.
Who the hell are you?
I'm your brother.
Jarod, go and find our parents.
I want to know what I look like.
I want to know who I am.
I want to know who I am...
I'm not really a plastic surgeon.
My name is Jarod.
I'm not really a doctor.
Jarod Jones.
I'm not really in the Coast Guard.
Jarod Kent.
Jarod O'Leary.
Jarod Wright.
Who the hell are you?
Well, I sure as hell aren't Florence Nightingale.
This is who you look like.
This is who you are...
You're my son.
You're my life.
I love you, Jarod.
Then one night you hit a little girl.
Jarod.
Hi, Jarod.
Hello?
Hello. My name is Argyle.
A.R.G.Y.L.E.
Um? Is this the Centre?
Maybe. Why?
I don't know.
Maybe I've got something you want.
Uh huh!
Well, I'm all ears.
Dog here, he's a hero.
See I rescued him from the pond.
And he saved you.
He saved you, I saved him. It's ironic.
It's ironic. Yeah?
When did I go from patient to prisoner?
Prisoner.
Prisoner.
Prisoner! That's cold man.
That's cold.
What would you call it?
What would I call it? What would I call it?
I, I call it ironic.
I call it ironic. I call it ironic.
Just slip into my skin for a second, would you?
Just for a second, slip into my skin.
A wigged out stewardess, gets a hangnail.
Kills the entire flight crew.
Three hundred people drop out of the clouds. Boom!
A postman goes postal. Bang!
A Bus driver goes bustal. Crash!
And we, we all sit idly by
and say ˇ°You are crazy man. Crazy. That was so crazy. I'm glad it wasn't me.ˇ±
The point is you've been sprouting crazy here a while now.
And I'm just making sure that's not me.
Okay. Fair's fair.
And by the way, I'm not into hurting you either.
So you can rack easy on that bro.
Hey, I wish we had a deck of cards
because I got this great trick I could show you.
Is that my phone?
Yeah.
Who'd you call?
Yeah! I just called the doctor.
I called your doctor to see if he made house calls..
You called Sydney?
No. No. No. He wasn't there but a lady answered.
- Miss Parker?
- No. No. No. No. It's Bridget.
- She sounded sexy.
- Did you tell them where you are?
What? Do I look like a road sign?
Listen to me. These people. This organisation. They will kill you. Trust me.
Trust you? No, you listen to me.
Trust. Trust. Great word. Right?
Trust. It's on every coin, every bill, every buck, every bond in this country.
And yet it's still the one thing you still can't buy.
Argyle!
They are setting you up!
No! No! No! No! No! No!
Bridget said you'd have an answer for everything and you do.
Don't ruin everything.
It's good here. It's good. It's good.
Three hours ago you didn't know whether you were park ranger or rodeo clown.
Now you're cracking foxy about some secret organisation that wants to hurt me.
It's you they want, my friend.
It's you.
I just happen to hold the deed.
You listen to me.
I speak from experience.
You're dealing with the devil.
Thank you for joining us, Miss Parker.
Well, it was an invitation that I simply couldn't pass up.
Lose the butt.
You don't have to worry about me blowing smoke.
Put it out!
This is cruel.
Even for a T-Board.
Fire away, babe. I'm not going anywhere.
The Triumvirate is a bit murky concerning your motives in the pursuit of Jarod.
Well. Maybe they should pull their heads out of their sand boxes.
I do my job. Period!
What we are looking for is the truth.
Truth?
That is a very interesting word coming from you.
So you have no other agenda in doing your job.
No unresolved issues or conflicts with the Centre or Jarod.
I have no unresolved issues with the Centre.
Is that the truth?
I know the truth, Miss Parker.
And what truth is that, Jarod?
The truth about what makes you sad.
Daddy, I want to know what really happened to my Mum.
I have no unresolved issues with the Centre.
You didn't answer about Jarod.
Where did you find my mother's ring.
In one of your mother's safe deposit boxes.
Like her medical file.
Oh, you'd be surprised what one can find in there.
Jarod!
You know the dance, Miss Parker.
You help me with one of my secrets, I help you with one of yours.
We weren't able to find anything about Igor or Fenigor.
I don't know if he was my mother's allier or betrayer.
Well, keep searching.
Igor holds the secret to both our pasts.
What makes you so sure?
Call it a gut feeling.
So you're saying that in your past year and a half pursuit
he's not had any undue influence on you?
That's what I'm saying.
Not of any kind?
No influence at all!
Not even emotional?
They say it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.
Do you believe that's true?
You paint a pretty sad picture.
How do we end up like this?
Like what?
Alone.
Searching.
It's ironic because we both want the same things.
Someone to care about
someone to care about us.
Do you think we'll ever find that kind of love in our lifes?
How do we end up like this?...
Miss Parker?
Miss Parker?
Hi!
We're done here.
Miss Parker.
You may have a cigarette now.
I just quit.
Mr. Argyle.
You know Bridget.
If your body is half as good as your brain
you and I might just find a way, you know.
Coming from a man of your brilliance that's quite a compliment.
Hey, by the way you hit it right on the nail indeed about cashew boy here.
He's a nut, alright?
Yes. He's crazy.
But he's resourceful!
So have you come up with a price?
Bridget. If this is about Jarod...
Shhh. I'm on the phone.
You know, I was out scamming this softie suburbanite the other day out of his lunch money
when I saw this dapper Dan in a Rolls Royce.
A Rolls Royce, Huh?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah!
Real, real shiny!
Anyway, this guy right, he gets out of the car,
and I find myself staring at his threads, right.
I'm staring at this cat's threads
and I'm thinking to myself I don't know the dude from the president of England.
I don't know if he's a liar,
if he kicks his dog, if he smacks his old lady, nothing.
And yet, I find myself having this instant, incredible respect for the guy
on account of the suit he's wearing.
Ah hah! Go On.
Yeah! His suit, his shirt, his watch, his loafers, the whole kit and caboodle.
One piece more expensive than the next.
Silk on silk. Leather on leather.
And you know, I'm thinking to myself, Bridget,
I'm thinking to myself, to drape this guy it must have cost at least,
I don't know, at least ten thousand dollars, Bridget.
Is that the price of respect, Mr Argyle?
Hey! Hey, a man ain't squat without respect.
Well, ten thousand dollars is a great deal of money
but I think I can convince my people to approve it.
No!
No! Big brain.
Don't do this.
Bridget? Write this down.
That's just three hours away.
I'm on the next plane.
If you've found, Jarod I am the only one who can bring him in.
Sorry darling.
This time he comes in.
Hey! Hey! It's all for the best.
You're going back where you belong.
I'm getting out of here.
It'll all be fine.
Trust me.
Trust me!
This sucks!
Why are they making us just sit here and wait.
So when wonder woman brings him in
it will prove the point we didn't because one of us was helping him.
Leaving us as good as dead, huh?
I never thought that I'd be rooting for Jarod.
I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean that!
Daddy!
Angel.
Oh, I came as soon as I found out.
How dare they put my daughter through a T-Board.
- Are you alright?
- For now.
You'll all be out of here after I lop off a few heads.
Daddy, be careful.
Right.
Boy, I never thought I'd be glad to see your old man.
Yeah, I'm glad he's here too, Broots.
Unfortunately, there's reason to believe he's been here the whole time.
I'm sorry, Parker.
He's done it again.
Mr. Argyle?
Bridget?
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you!
Get the case out of the trunk, Willie.
Yes. You've got something for me in the trunk, Willie?
I bring you respect in a bag.
Oh wow.
Ten thousand real ones.
Where's Jarod?
He's in the basement, in the boiler room. Hey!
Willie, when you see I've Jarod,
put a bullet in his brain,
if you can find it.
My pleasure.
What are you talking about ''bullet in my brain''?
That's not nice!
Hey, hey.
Damn!
Well, if it isn't sleeping beauty.
And they said you were so hard to catch.
Time to rise and shine.
Wake up, my little love muffin.
Come on, baby, wake Up!
Wake up.
Hi. Time to go home.
Sorry.
But I'm never going back there.
You're not so mean.
Nice to see you again, Willie.
Hi!
Your brass ring.
I knew you were the one to trust right from the start.
On second thought.
I think I'll donate it
to the pond.
In dog's name.
Like you said, he's the hero.
Give me back my pez.
Bridget?
Nope! Sorry! It's just Jarod.
But you can come and pick up your blonde now.
Sweet dreams, love.
She blew it, didn't she?
- Jarod?
- Alive, still free!
So are you.
Thanks for the robe.
Give ne a lift?
To where, daddy? Another dead end.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you dare!
You set me up, for a T-Board?
I was wondering how long it would take you to figure that out.
Come on. You really don't think I could fool you.
You're a Parker.
I'd be stupid to even try.
Besides these damn shoes are killing me.
If this is true, then why would you ally with Bridget?
Bridget cut a deal with the Triumvirate.
Your butt for hers.
I had to go along with her to get rid of her for good.
Action, reaction.
Give and take.
It's not about who knows what
It's about who thinks they know what and what you want them to think.
- I...
- To keep the hungry dogs away
you must toss them a bone now and then.
Is that what I am? A bone?
You're my legacy and you proved it again today.
Never forget that.
It'll keep you alive.
Trust me.
You should find something you can trust.
And you trust me.
Trust me.
How can you still trust him? Trust him?
Will you be alright, Miss Parker?
Of course.
Let's get out of here.
Let's go. Let's go.
Sydney, do you think that someone in the Centre is really helping Jarod?
In the Centre? Anything's possible.
We're still searching for him
and we'll find the leak.
Did you uncover something that can help us find Jarod, Angelo?
Keep working.
Keep working.
See you tomorrow, same bat time same bat channel.
You remember me?
You don't learn so easy, do you, pal?
Maybe not.
But I never make the same mistake twice.
Who the hell are you?
I'm many people.
But tonight I'm a truck driver.

It's not working.
The white duck isn't accepting the mallards as part of his family.
Conclusion?
The family bond is primarily in bloods.
It's unbreakable.
Very good, Jarod.
My family is gone, Sydney.
If I ever left here, would anybody want me?
What is this place?
I get your back, Miss Parker.
Looks like monkey boy has some time on his hands.
Ah, Urban Combat Basics, The Best Vietminh Neutralisation Hand to Hand Combat, and you
Our ..has turned into a .. weekend warrior.
You shot me.
In the head.
You never looked better.
Something you want to share with us, Syd?
Syd.
Syd, are you alright?
Oh, yeah.
All cleared.
What is this? Testosterone headquarters?
What do you think all this means?
Well, looks like Jarod is preparing to go to a war.
Better hope .. shows us the ransom.
Quiet.
See anything?
I have seen nothing.
No cops?
Just hostlers and cracked.
We'll .be okay.
- Check the bedroom.
- Go, go..
Police! Freeze!
Come against the wall.
Check the whole place.
My name is Jarod.
You're going to be just fine.
There are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.
How many people died because of what I thought up?
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.
He is a pretender.
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
- The center wants him alive.
- Preferably.
He defends the weak and abused.
Life is a gift.

DICTATION: ±ż±ż/´Đ´Đ
You are a doctor?
I am, today.
Jarod.
Nice work last night, partner.
No shots, no casualties.
That's what love picture shows up.
That's a pleasure to be here, Sergeant Stevens.
It's an honor to be part of the T-14 Squad.
Although I am still trying to figure out what the T stands for.
Tend to life, if you ask the losers on city-locker.
Turbo..achieve.
- Turbo Squad.
- Turbo Squad.
We are well oiled machine.
- Based on your moves last night, you fit in just fine.
- Hey, man.
I heard about the shooting incident.
Lieutenant Lang is going to be a tough fact to follow.
Dan was ... guy.
He's gonna be missed.
That cop-killer better hope I don't find his worthless ass. That's all I got to say.
Is a precinct picnic used to be all kinds of fun, for all these bitches and morons.
Tracking another ... , Detective?
You guys are making Lang up to be some sort of hero. Truth is he was a fool.
Why don't you take some place else, loser?
- Truth hurts, Sergeant Stevens?
- No, this does.
Come on, Detective. Are you alright?
Why do you keep defending this guy?
He threw himself in between a shooter and his partner. He was a good cop.
... alright? And it got him killed.
Right in front of Lang's kids. That was nice.
That was really nice.
I didn't know.
''S.W.A.T. Officer Killed, Unknown Assailant''
''Police Officer Leaves Two Young Sons Behind''
''Jet'aime, Michelle''
Jet'aime, Michelle.
I love you too.
Hey, Sydney.
Routine scans from last week.
Are you okay, Sydney?
Broots, can I trust you?
Absolutely.
I told you about the dream I keep having about Miss Parker, didn't I?
I need your help to find a person.
Her name is Michelle Lucca.
Okay.
This is every thing I remember about her.
Broots, this is important to me.
Please be secretive.
Okay, Sydney.
You know you can count on me.
Hate to break up the coffee clutch.
But Broots is needed on sublevel five right away.
Oh, okay. Do the course.
Everything okay, Syd?
Fine, Miss Parker, fine.
In a hurry, Broots?
Oh, hi.
What?
I want the paper Sydney gave you.
- You're listening at the door?
- It was an accident.
Call the cop. The paper!
Michelle Lucca.
Dr. Pavlov has been drooling ever since he found that note from Jarod.
Do exactly what's Sydney asked.
Okay.
If Sydney's protecting Jarod for some reason, I need to know about it. You got it?
Yeah.
Oh, and Broots.
I can't wait to hear about that dream of yours.
And we are clear.
What did the hell you shoot that, Mooney? Cleveland?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I need some air.
What's with him?
I don't know.
Nice choice of simulation scenario, Jarod.
Well, Simulation is sort of my speciality.
You and Cook, you show some ... shooting.
Just back up the team.
What's up?
I really drop the ball back there.
Maybe the simulation was a little too close the home.
Maybe it reminded you the day you got shot.
The day Dan Lang was killed.
It's only been two weeks.
I was like I was living that again.
... was going off.
Dan screaming, pain cutting into my leg.
Classic syndromes of post-traumatic stress.
Have you talked to someone?
I am doing mandatory search since the department shrink.
I just can't get it out of my head.
Stress can be triggered by a number of factors.
Anger.
Fear.
Guilty.
Guilty?
About how Dan Lang died to save your life.
Look, Your physical wounds are healing.
Maybe it's time to start dealing with your emotional ones.
It will heal when I catch the man that murdered my partner.
We run the simulations to hold our technical skills.
Same thing can work for healing emotions.
Well, we got a call about butch bank robbery.
The suspect drove three blocks and abandoned his car
and broke into a roller rink.
Lang and I made entry there.
Just behind those lockers.
We moved to our breaches but we were pinned by gunfire coming from the box.
Up there.
I had Lang's ... then I was hit in the leg and went down.
Dan stood between me and the shooter just kept firing.
It sounded like we were in the middle of a war.
Stevens and Cook were taking a cover position over there.
You could see them?
I didn't have to.
It's standard technical procedure.
Anyway, the next thing I knew, Lang was shot and went down.
That's when I saw the shooter.
He stood open to the light.
White man, six feet, ..build,
goatee and in a baseball cap.
Son of the bitch knew what he was doing too.
They found powder of M1-32 shell casings.
Armor-piercing rounds
Cop killers.
Tore off Lang's vest like paper.
They call us the Turbo Squad.
Pistons in the same engine.
If we don't fire at the right time,
that engine breaks down.
People die.
- Anything on this Michelle Lucca?
- No on Michelle Lucca.
Yes on Michelle Stamatis.
Married and living in New York state.
But that's not the screwy part.
- What is that surprised me?
- Well, there is absolutely no record of Michelle Lucca ever have existed before moving to Albany in 1974.
No drivers licences, no birth certificate, nothing.
Broots.
Look deeper.
Then you can give Sydney her address but nothing else.
We need to find that note Jarod left Sydney in the cabin.
I am sure he hid it pretty well.
You haven't seen it, have you? Broots?
No way, no.
Miss Parker, this woman obviously means a lot to Sydney.
Your point?
Whatever happens with respecting someone's privacy?
Look, I know how much you care about Sydney.
How the old goat's even going on me a little.
But this might have something to do with Jarod.
And that, is what's important.
This is central dispatched T-14.
Suspects invaded a roller rink in 21B shore road.
He is armed and dangerous, over.
This is Lang. Officer Mooney and I abandoned the building.
Officer Stevens and Cook have taken flank positions. Over.
Copy entry, keep this channel 11 of T14, over.
Request immediately backup, officer down.
Repeat T14?
Lang was hit!
Officer down...
Copy officer down. Backup in road, over.
Response, T14, over.
Officer Lang, please respond. Officer Lang, this is dispatch, please respond.
This is Lang. I can't, I can't feel my legs.
Daniel, talk to me. Stay with me. The ambulance is on the way.
This's so cold. I am so cold.
Daniel, stay with me.
Please tell my boys,
tell Jordan and Cody, daddy loves them.
You can tell them that yourself, Daniel. Just hang on.
Daniel? Oh, My God!
Daniel, stay with me.
Please tell my boys,
tell Jordan and Cody, daddy loves them.
Ceramics figurines with vegetation for hair.
Chia pets.
Pets?
Yeah. I never have much for green thumb and animals hate me.
It seems like a logical solution.
I am Jarod.
Dan Lang's replacement.
I don't think it's possible to replace a man like lieutenant Lang.
No.
You were working dispatch on the night lieutenant Lang was killed.
I was the last person speak to him.
It must be very difficult for you.
Considering how you and Dan felt about each other.
What?
You two were in love.
I heard the dispatch tape.
I could hear it in your voice, the way you spoke to each other.
It must be very comforting for Dan.
To have you there until the end.
Daniel lost his wife just a year ago.
Since then, it's just been him and the boys.
You were close to his sons?
Yeah, very.
The only family they have left, are Daniel's parents in Seattle.
I have been tried to contact them about taking custody of Jordan and Cody.
Trouble is they've been travelling in Europe for over a month.
I am really gonna miss those kids.
It's difficult,
losing people that we love.
Yeah.
I haven't even cleaned out his locker yet.
It sounds silly.
It makes he seems a final.
So real.
I don't want to forget him.
I want to do something, you know, make a difference.
At least I want to get this cop killer bullet off the street.
Did Dan happen to mention anyone,
who might be supplying that type of ammunition in street?
He did mention a man named Petrovka.
Vladimir Petrovka, a local Russian connected to the Moscow Maffia.
Interpol thinks he might be responsible for smuggling cop killer ammunitions in States.
Among other things.
That's definitely him. I remember hearing his name a lot just before Daniel made up his mind to leave the team.
Daniel was planning to leave Turbo Squad?
Yeah, it was strange.
The last few weeks before the shooting,
he became so distant as if he knew something was gonna happen.
That is strange.
He said he was leaving Turbo because he was burnt out.
But, I think it was because of the boys.
Jordan and Cody were the world of him.
Now they may not have anybody.
Michelle Lucca, the more I look, the less I find.
I access ClA,FBl and...
He is not there.
Interpol files.
None of them have any record of her having ever existed prior to 1974.
so, I got the thinking,
who else could wipe out a person's past so efficiently?
- She worked for the Center.
- Got information, Miss Parker.
She was the clinical psychologist to work very closely with Sydney on the pretender project.
She is beautiful, isn't she?
Figure out how this connects to that note Jarod left.
I'll get on this right away, then.
You are hiding something, Broots.
What?
I think you heard me.
I promised Sydney he can trust me.
- And you feel like you're lying to him, right?
- Yes.
So, by giving me the rest of what you know,
it doesn't make you any more despicable than you are really are.
Right?
Right.
Let's go in my office.
Jordan and Cody remain with ..., but ... respective considering they lost their father.
I understand that. The boys' grandparents might take custody.
And apparently they are out of the country. We're still trying to make a contact.
What happens if they'are unable to take custody?
What happens to Jordan and Cody then?
Statistically older children particularly ones with emotional scars are very difficult to place.
If I ever left here, would anybody want me?
Let's ...
You must be good at this game.
Would you like to play?
Whatever.
You are a S.W.A.T.
Yes, I am.
So, did you know our dad?
No, but I hear he was a great guy.
Do you guys remember anything strange happening before your father's accident?
He yelled one night.
- Yelled?
- At the men.
Me and Cody've gone to bed and we woke up when we heard them fighting.
- Did you see these men?
- No, but we can hear them.
Dad was real mad.
He kept telling them that he didn't want to be involved and that they should leave.
It was a few nights before...you know.
Are you okay?
Everyday before he went to work,
he said nothing would happen to him.
He promised.
Cody, Your father died of saving another police officer.
There is nothing more heroic than that.
This is so wrong.
Sydney should be entitled to a private life.
Keep looking.
He was poped around here when I was here before him.
I got it.
What?
Oh God!
Oh, Miss Parker.
- Sydney, we were just...
- Just looking for you because I need your report on the surveillance scans.
- I'll put them on your desk.
- Thank you.
- Any news, Broots?
- Almost.
Give me that!
It is a birth certificate.
Michelle Lucca is named as the mother but there is no one here as the father.
Sydney.
I was in the cover position near the back breaches with officer Cook when we heard gunfire.
We immediately returned the fire.
I was hit almost immediately.
That's when Dan, I mean Officer Lang began to return fire.
The next thing I knew he was down.
And I can see the shooter, the guy with goatee and baseball cap looking right at me.
Felt like the fire fight lasted twenty minutes.
When we stop firing, we heard another weapon, sounded like one of our MP5 nine mm coming from the breaches in front of us.
Felt like the fire fight lasted twenty minutes.
Felt like the fire fight lasted ...
Felt like the fire fight...
Felt like the fire fight ...
I can't believe that buddy reopened the roller rink that haven't fixed the damage.
Liz, what kind of weapons were Mooney and Lang carrying the day of shooting?
9 mm hand guns.
Stevens and Cook?
- M16 assault rifles, standard team issue.
- Right.
Going to fire...
I can't feel my legs.
Daniel, oh my god.
I am sorry.
I shouldn't have brought you here.
Why did you ask about the weapons?
Because maybe Mooney and Lang didn't have a back up after at all.
What are you talking about? Stevens and Cook were right behind them.
Were they?
Cook said there was a fire fight.
Yeah, so?
So there were such a vicious exchange of gun fire,
why there aren't more bullet holes.
And why are all these bullet holes exact same size?
You lost me.
An M16 slot leaves slightly smaller bullet hole than 9 mm.
It's not something you would notice unless you're looking for it.
And none of these bullet holes come from the assault weapon.
Stevens and Cook are expert marksman.
I've seen them shoot.
That box is only thirty yards away.
Yet they miss their target.
Why is that?
You're saying that they never fired at the shooter.
I am saying that maybe,
just maybe, who's never shooting in the first place.
Then who killed Daniel?
Maybeˇ­
Stevens and Cook.
The birth certificate is from 1974 for a boy named Nicholas.
He was born about eight months after Michelle Lucca left the Center.
... thinking what to do with that part of his enemy.
Now he gets a son out there.
That's just why we should leave him alone.
Give the moral ..., Broots.
I wouldn't want anyone from the Center getting involved my daughter's life.
We have to back off, Miss Parker.
For Sydney show some testosterone ... you.
Must be ... water.
Would you put that away?
The Center made Michelle disappeared. Don't, don't you think they've done enough to Sydney?
I told you this isn't about Sydney. It's about Jarod.
If you say that, I just wonder if you believe it.
''Night Vision''
A voice from beyond the grave.
This lieutenant Daniel B. Lang. Badge number 44562.
The date is March 4.
The time is eleven eighteen PM.
My location is 570 Franklin Avenue.
I am currently on observations of Officer Stevens, Cooke and Mooney with one fled from here, Petrovka.
the known criminal with ties to the Russian Maffia.
And convictions on weapons and drug charges.
This is the second meeting which I have witnessed the exchange of money.
I plan to turn this surveillance tape over to the District Attorney's office as soon as I collect enough evidence.
I just hope I can stop this before anybody concerned.
You may have been too late, Dan.
But I won't be.
Nick, you're...
When I returned to the Center, your desk has been cleared out, your project reassigned, and your apartment was empty.
You left without a trace.
I had only this.
Jet'aime.
Michelle, if you loved me,
how could you leave without saying goodbye?
Because I loved you.
I received a copy of a birth certificate.
A boy named Nicholas,
born eight months after you left.
No father listed.
Michelle.
Am I the father?
Sydney.
Well, am I?
Do you remember that Easter weekend we spent at the cabin?
After a few weeks I got up one morning, I wasn't feeling very well.
So I made an appointment with my doctor.
You were pregnant.
I was so excited.
For me, for us.
I rushed to Blue Cove to tell you. When I got to the Center,
I was stopped.
By whom?
By a man that I've never even seen before.
I don't know how. But somehow he knew about our child.
He gave me a choice, Sydney.
The Center would relocate me,
set up a substantial trust fund for Nicholas ifˇ­
I promise never to see you, speak with you again.
And if you refused?
He said you would be in a terrible accident.
He said the Center couldn't take a chance that you're becoming distracted.
compromising your objectivity towards the pretender project.
Sydney, I was afraid.
After I left and Nicholas was born.
I met someone.
And got married.
He raised our child as his own.
We chose never to tell him the truth.
We can tell him now.
At what cost?
He is such a bright, splendid young man with a great future.
He is going to be a teacher like you.
And he is going to be back in any minute now. I have to go.
I hope you understand, Sydney.
At least this time, we can say goodbye.
Sydney.
The inscription on the watch,
I meant it.
Forever.
I found this in a box full of case files.
Vladimir Petrovka.
- He was arrested two years ago byˇ­
- Stevens, Cook and Mooney?
That's when Petrovka began his relationship with the Turbo Squad.
This is before Daniel joined the team.
Petrovka got off on a technicality.
Now Stevens and the others get paid to tip the Petrovka off about raids.
Their father found out and confronted them.
That must the fight the boys overheard.
He was going to turn them in.
So they killed him.
It's not over, Liz.
Not yet.
Going somewhere?
I saw the birth certificate, Sydney.
Michelle said the Center threatened to have me killed if I ever found out about my son.
She was told to leave. They stole my life, Parker.
Just like they stole Jarod's.
- And Angelo's andˇ­
- Mine?
If you leave now,
then you'll never find out who did this.
You're not really gonna leave, are you, Sydney?
Apparently not.
If you knew about the birth certificate, why didn't you confront me?
Everyone deserves a life.
Even you.
So what the hell couldn't you hit the 45?
Get out of here. I don't want you to talk about my target.
- I was talking about your target.
- Oh, no, man.
I was talking about your 45, too.
Alright, we'll meet at technical region in the morning.
- We'll just have to prove it.
- Yeah.
T-14, we have confirmed sighting of ...
male matches the description of suspect wanted in the murder of lieutenant Daniel Lang.
21B Shore Road, shots happen and fires.
That's the roller rink.
Dispatch, dispatch, this is Sergeant Stevens.
- Have I reached you correctly?
- Affirmative.
You have done the same request and ... immediately.
Oh, come on. Let's move.
Blood.
Looks like the cop killer is back.
Alright, we go in together this time.
Jarod, you wait for my call.
- What the hell is he doing?
- Forget it. Let's move.
Cook, stay with me at point. Mooney, cover our flank.
Yes, sir.
- I don't like this.
- Neither do I. Let's go.
Ready? Go.
Jarod, this is Stevens. Respond.
Respond, damn it. That's an order!
- Where did he go?
- I'll take care of him later.
Keep your eyes open.
Move on.
Hold your fire.
It's a damn target.
What is this?
He is not going down.
I am shooting straight at him
Blanks. They are blanks. Somebody switched the armor.
Who the hell are you?
You know me.
I am the man each of you created.
The shooter in a baseball cap with a goatee.
The man you made up to cover for the murder of Dan Lang.
What are you talking about?
Lieutenant Lange found about your little pay offs from Petrovka.
When he confronted you, you killed him with armor piercing shells.
Cop killers.
It just so happens, I brought some with me tonight.
- Stop.
- You set up Lang, didn't you?
- It was Stevens idea.
- Shut up, Mooney.
You left two boys without a father, for what?
For money?
Better hope you don't miss. We'll blow you away just like we did to Lang.
Did you get all that, Liz?
Every last word.
You got the switch ... this one, didn't you?
What are you gonna do, Jarod? Shoot me?
If I go, you go.
It is over, Stevens.
He, he is right.
It's gonna enough killing, Stevens.
- I'm glad they finally got the hold of Dan's parents.
- Yeah.
They'll take the boys back to Seattle.
They seem like very nice people.
Jordan and Cody are going to miss you.
The Lang said I can visit anytime I want it.
I just wish they are living closer.
Got a lot of ... tell them about their father.
You could always move there.
And do what?
It's not like they need another dispatcher in Seattle.
Oh, it's funny you should mention that.
Because I put a call into the Seattle PD,
and just so happen they're looking for a good person to fill a recently vacated switchboard position.
So if you want the job,
starting in two weeks.
Thank you.
Oh, no. Thank you.
For what?
Making sure those kids knew that someone cares about them.
- Are you here going home?
- Grandpa and grandma have a farm.
With real horses.
Real horses, wow.
Listenˇ­
- Will you make me a promise?
- What?
No matter how busy you are, how crazy your life is getting in the future,
always remember,
that your dad loved you very much.
You promise?
Promise.
Promise.
Where is Syd? I haven't seen him all the morning.
He said he had something important to do at Albany.
Hey, look, Miss Parker.
Don't.
Back off.
Hey, look.
It's chia me.
Little less hair than I am used to.
Well, like I said before, you never look better.
Nice job. See you next time, okay?
Erica, I was gonna talk to you about the ... principles.
I think you essays could be a little bit more in depth.
Maybe you could look at the third chapter, okay?
There is no job more important than teaching.
That's what they keep telling me.
Enjoy your life.
It passes so quickly.
I'm sorry. Do I know you from somewhere?
I am afraid you don't.
This is Sydney.
Did you find your son?
Yes, I did.
Did you remember a long time ago, I asked you
if a family would ever want me?
I do.
I thought it took blood to bond people.
But I've learned it also takes something else.
It takes love.
I hope you are right, Jarod.

And never in such severe results.

That's the word Jarod used.
It was blown away by all the stuff we made.
He even tried us to hang his mirrors.

Ah, this is weird.
That is twisted.
You think that is twisted, come and see this.

Hey, baby.
There are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-Six Hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.
How many people died because of what I thought up?
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.

DICTATION: ±ż±ż/´Đ´Đ
You are a doctor?
I am, today.
''Five-Year-Old Witnesses DEA Murder''
''Child Witness Remains Traumatized''
Dr. Leary.
Actually, it's agent Leary.
Special Agent Roger Bingham.
This is Andrew Stess.
Ah, it's nice to meet you, agent Stess.
I heard you're on here 30 seconds before the bullet started flying,
and you were the one that jumped on the kid.
Lucky time, I guess.
I guess you gonna won a medal.
Actually I was just doing my job.
Meaning we weren't?
Listen, Freud, it's bad enough Davis thinks someone in the department is leaking safe house location.
We don't need him riding us because some outsider did our job.
You wanna be a hero? Go and do it on somebody else's watch.
- Jarod, what are you still doing here?
- Mr. Davis.
Starting to sigh which word comes with worse: the ambush last night or Bingham and Stess.
Look, we're all under a lot of pressure.
Unless that crab-louse testifies what he saw because drug dealer will sell the rest drugs away.
What's all these?
Nickie was traumatized by what he witnessed.
These can help open him up and bring him out of silence.
The kid watch Emilio Vasquez execute one of our best DEA agents and detectives.
Men of Vasquez hit him and tried to kill him.
And you think a damn slinky is gonna help him talk?
Well, it's not that simplistic.
You see studies have shown if you take a child which has beenˇ­
Listen, not personal. Doc. But between you and me,
give you damn about your studies.
You've got two days to make the kid talk,
after that I'll do it in my way.
Angelo has been moved.
Do you know anything about that, Miss Parker?
Are you talking to me?
Exactly one hour after he was moved,
I was notified I'm under Tower review.
As we speak, they've set cleaners scour in my personal files, my office, everything.
I'm crying on the inside.
If you sessions don't happen without a directive.
If I find out you are behind this...
You'll what?
Throw me in front of another T-board?
What secrets are you protecting, Dr. Raines?
The same ones as my mother found?
The ones that got her killed?
Maybe they'll get Angelo to talk.
Or is it Timmy?
Nickie, I think we will be safe in here.
Thanks.
Hi, Carla.
Hi.
Hi, Nikkie.
Wow, these are great toys.
This, my friend, is my own personal special toys.
You certain can play with whatever you want.
I've got a Mr. Potato Head,
a Magic 8-ball...
And this is my personal favorite.
You know, I've never seen a shrink wear a gun before.
Well, by definition I am a psychological reconstructionist.
I use memory and emotion to unlock the truth
when somebody is suffering from post traumatic stress.
Can you give me back my son?
That's the idea.
Carla, in order for me to rebuild his memories,
I have to reconstruct the events of what happened that day.
Yeah.
I worked as a nurse.
I had a few hours before my shift started so
I decided to take Nickie and Charlie to the Laundromat.
Charlie?
It's Nickie's cat.
I put Nickie in the chair,
gave him some chocolate milk.
I turned to load the machine,
and I started talking to another woman.
I lost track of time.
And later I heard this poping sound that was coming from behind the building.
I turned around.
Nickie was gone.
What happened next?
I paniced.
And I ran outside behind the Laundromat.
and I saw a man...
lying there in the alley.
Where was Nickie?
He was gone.
I have looked everywhere for him,
while the other woman, she called the police.
I warned Nickie never to go out by himself.
But it's cat Charlie...
that was going out.
And he went to find him.
I was talking to one of the cops...
That's where we found him.
Nickie.
Oh, little guy.
He had been trapped under the body for a long time.
And he hasn't said a word since then.
Can you imagine that kind of fear?
It must have been terrible.
Willie.
Einnad, no.
Hey.
''Corrupt DEA Agent Killed in Drug Deal Gone Bad''
I don't think the kid is telling us that Emilio Vasquez shot Agent Cruz.
It takes time.
Sometimes it takes good swat in the ass.
I'll bet Bingham can match the 6 in the next lottery
than this kid ... Vasquez is the shooter.
Don't jink me. The lottery is of the thirty million.
You are ruining Washington as you boys started that Cruz was dirty
that he wasn't trying to bust Vasquez,
he was selling to him
and then he was using the seizure warehouse as one personal drug store.
Rumors are just rumors.
That little boy here is the only one that knows the truth.
And hopefully before Vasquez find his silence for good,
you'll start playing with all your little toys in here and get him to speak.
And what would you suggest I do?
An interrogation?
Something scared the kid silent. I'm damn sure we can scare him to talk.
Hey, Nickie.
I've got a treat for you.
Chocolate milk.
Now, I've heard about this powder.
It's somehow dramatic ... composition of milk, right?
You've never had chocolate milk?
It wasn't allowed where I grew up.
Wow, can you believe that, Nickie?
Nickie, Can I try?
Jarod, I have been shot!
Don't you worry, Carla. I'll take care of Nickie.
I want the leak sealed.
If that means every agent takes a polygraph, then do it.
I don't trust anybody around here.
Nickie.
Your mum is going to be fine,
as soon as the doctor takes a look at it.
In the meantime, would you like to go with me to check out your new place?
Do you think maybe she needs a safe place?
You can trust me, Nickie.
Would you mind if I put something in here too?
She is my mum.
I always keep her close.
Will you take care of her for me?
There.
And Nickie.
After a while, it won'e be so bad.
and you will feel strong enough
to put the hurt in the safe place.
This house sits on a myth of tunnels.
There is just oneway in or out.
Why would anybody build something like this?
Paranoia.
People with everything always is afraid somebody is going to take it away.
You must be right.
Listen up, people.
And this house has been built on series of tunnels.
Each tunnel connects four sections of this estate,
with entries and exits,
both within the house, and underground like these drainage vent here in the driveway.
I want every access point secured.
Let's get to work!
Get me a real doctor.
Who attacked you?
I don't know.
I'm trying to help you here.
Willie, Let's go.
No problem, Mr. Raines.
He's hiding something.
... delirious from the anaesthesia,
he kept repeating the same thing over and over.
Name Einnad mean anything to either of you?
Einnad? A disgruntled ex-employee?
Possible but those injuries aren't random.
The attacker slashed this into Raines' arm.
One fifty-five...
That's the room at SL-27 where Raines used to run his experiments.
Judging from the violence,
Einnad may have been one of those experiments.
Do you think my mother was trying to save Einnad too?
I know she's dying trying to stop Raines.
Possible.
What the hell was he trying to make out of him?
Blake? Jackson? Where the hell are you?
Nickie.
Nickie, where are you?
Nickie, I know you were scared.
I'm not buying your little silent acting.
You look at me when I talk to you!
Tell me what you saw!
Stess.
Not now.
I need to show you something.
Hey.
Wait in your room, I'll be there in a second.
... the little boy the wrong way again
his mother won't be only in the hospital!
Your way isn't working.
It just isn't your assignment to deal with.
Vasquez is personal.
The way I see you another bully by nature.
I don't think it's innocent little boy's silence is eating you alive.
You shrink.
What the hell is going on here?
Just a free therapy session.
No reference to Einnad in the mainfraim.
But I found out it's a Welsh name.
It means ''life'' or ''spirit''.
That's useful.
I need to know who Einnad is.
And why he attacked Raines.
Are you sure you want to look ... with Raines?
This tactic ... against your mother.
I am not my mother.
Broots.
Oh, please don't ask me to search Raines' office again, right...
Relax your back side. (Loosen the buttocks.)
I have a better idea.
Hi.
What're you doing?
Which isn't looked too good.
Maybe I can fix her.
Want me to try?
Here. Now she's all better.
Can I play?
Come here! Oh, I missed you so much!
I missed you, too.
You spoke!
He spoke.
I heard it.
''DEA Special Agent Decorated in Drug Bust''
''DEA Agent's Brother Dies of Overdose''
''Drugs Tied to Vasquez Cartel''
Well, you surprised me, agent Stess.
How's that?
I never would guess you would be a decorated officer.
What the hell are you doing with my file?
Oh, let's see. Decorated in 93.
But every year since then, you have been on disciplinary review.
Access of force, questionable investigated techniques.
In clinical terms, agent Stess, you're losing it.
- I've ventured about enough of you.
- Your brother worshiped you, didn't he?
But unfortunately, his addiction got the best of him.
And maybe he was just trying to live up to you.
Or maybe he was just overdid on purpose
for the attention.
I could kill you!
Save your anger for Vasquez.
It was his operation that sold your little brother the heroine that killed him.
Look, I know, you miss your little brother.
You're so hurt and you're so angry that you can't see straight.
I need your help.
Help me bring down Cruz's killer.
Help me save that little boy's life.
What's Marmaduke up to this week?
Ah, Oh, I haven't got to Marmaduke.
That was a quick butt.
Since when does Willie smoke?
I got it. I got it!
It was gasoline everywhere.
He was trying to torch this place.
- Question is why?
- He was trying to cover Raines' tracks.
- What tracks?
- It is written all over the walls.
Einnad.
Look at this!
It belonged to a Daniel Hilton Minor, Davidson Psychiatric Hospital.
That's a surprise!
Another fun house.
Where are the mirrors, Syd?
Miss Parker.
All of these prescribed in D. H. Minor by Dr. Williams.
Some of these go back 20 years.
Williams...As in William Raines.
How about this wallpaper though?
Excessive.
- Methodical.
- And raw.
Strange way of spelling Einnad, wouldn't you say?
But it's not what he's writing.
The answer's in the mirror.
D.A.N.N.I.E.
Dannie.
Who is Dannie?
Hey.
Check this out.
So the mass banking account of Cruz is going to check out?
Look at the last transaction.
Five hundred thousand on April 9.
The day after Cruz was murdered.
How much heroin did you say was missing from the seizure warehouse?
Half a million.
There is no name on the account.
Just a reference number.
Hey, how did you get out of your...
You couldn't sleep, huh?
Is everything safe in there?
Nickie.
Do you remember this man?
Is this the man from the alley?
Nickie.
It's ok. I want you go back to bed.
If Vasquez is the murderer, how come his photograph didn'r traumatize Nickie.
You know, maybe all your slinky stuff is working.
Maybe we are just not seeing the whole picture.
Jarod has been silent for thirty-six hours.
However he is showing signs of illucidity.
Attempting to sketch an image over and over.
This woman without a face.
I have decided to intervene.
Can you tell me who she is?
I cannot see her.
Who, Jarod?
I cannot remember.
I cannot remember any more.
is this your mother?
I cannot remember.
She's gone.
She's gone, Sydney.
She's gone.
Our boy Einnad is actually Daniel Hilton Minor,
One of the Center study groups in the late sixties.
His file ends in 1982.
- Right after the fire in SL 27.
- That's right.
Once Raines lost in 155, he has no place to work.
So he took it elsewhere.
Preliminary diagnosis: Mild Depression.
What a crock!
A mild depression can always be amplified.
- Brainwave manipulation?
- Um, hum.
Whatever Dannie's initial treatment,
the outcome warrant drugs prescribed in increasing dosages.
Let's talk to Raines: You got a headache, lobotomies.
And the perfectly treatable ... becomes the society identity disorder.
Multiple personalities.
Two of them we've known: Dannie and Einnad.
Looking in the mirror can be comforting to someone's suffering from the ID.
The mirror reflects the image of a unified self.
My mother couldn't save him.
She tried it, Miss Parker. She tried it.
But Raines got in the way.
Charlie.
Look what I've found.
Do you know what this is?
That's a very very nice hat.
And who are you?
Mummy!
Oh, hello, mummy.
It's ok.
I'm here to help you and Nickie.
You have a cat, don't you?
Charlie.
Charlie.
I bet Charlie loved to play in the alley.
It that what happened the day in the laundromat?
I found him.
Ok, you found him.
And then a man came up, right?
Two men?
I was in the boxes. No one can see me.
But you can see them.
These men...
Did they look like they came from Mexico?
One of the men?
And the other man?
Jackpot!
Mr. Jackpot was with the other man?
They both had suitcases?
And then they swithed them.
And that's when that happened.
Another man came.
Agent Cruz.
What happened next, Nickie?
They got really mad and Mr. Jackpot pulled out a gun.
He shot the other man!
Then he felt on me.
And I was scared, I couldn't move.
Jarod.
Bingham.
Then the policemen came and your mummy came, and you are ok?
Can't you remember, honey?
Agent Bingham came with the others when mummy was talking to the police,
and he was talking to you.
He took me away.
Kid.
You tell anyone...
this is your mummy.
Any progress?
Nothing.
The transfer's gonna happen tomorrow at eight thirty.
Why?
Dr. Shrink's time's up.
They want the kid over to official headquarters.
What have we got?
Social divided identity disorder with both personalities
are compelled to cover at living space,
even if it's within the same home.
So far, we've only found Einnad's space.
We didn't find Dannie's.
Anyone ever tell you you are not a duck?
Duck?
Alticationly.
Hey, we are running out of time.
Nail this kid.
And 5 Kg will be waiting in the alley, south Columbia Avenue.
Run heroin from the locker.
And they are going to transport the kid tomorrow night.
They'll come in van. Here is the address.
I want you to make sure that transport never leave ...
No problem.
This better be primo junk,
or I swear you'll end up like Cruz.
I checked all the doors.
There are nothing.
It's not doors, it's walls.
Make him stop.
Kill, Kill me, please!
Kill me and he'll stop.
I am not there to hurt you, Dannie.
Manhole cover
It's time to move.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I don't know about you, but it's going to be cold damn June before we'll see the kid again!
I'll call...
I'll take a drive around the perimeter.
- Are you ok?
- Good as paranoia!
What will we do now?
We get the bad guy.
Jarod.
Don't look so shocked.
I couldn't resist about the explosion.
I had to see what a little boy's life was worth to you.
What is it? Five kg?
Ten?
These guys, they think Nickie is dead.
And Vasquez is going to want his heroin pronto.
I'm going to have to kill you.
Like you killed Cruz?
But before you pull the trigger, right,
strongly suggest you to check out your primo junk.
Chocolate.
Somehow I don't think these guys are the chocolate milk type.
What is the matter, Roger?
Cat got your tongue?
Imagine how Nickie felt.
He witnessed a brutal murder,
as a dead body fell on top of him.
Do you have any idea what that kind of fear can do to a child?
And then when it's all over, you threaten to kill his mother if he talks.
Well, he's talking now.
He's telling Davis all about how you deal drugs,
how you killed Cruz.
- You've got nothing on me.
- Come on, Roger.
Admit it.
I can stop these guys.
I have got the real stuff right here.
Ok, I killed Cruz.
- Give me the case.
- At your service.
You got milk?
Do you feel nicely?
Where did you get that?
Handball.
The Tower review has been given new evidence.
Something about my extracurricular activities.
You should hire better people.
- Smoke?
- No.
You remind me of someone I used to know...
Someone who looked exactly like you.
I am not my mother.
Do not make the mistake of forgetting that.
We should all be careful of the mistakes we make,
shouldn't we?
I've just spoke with the hospital.
Dannie has been transferred.
He's now my patient.
Why would Raines have created something like him?
Maybe he was trying to make his own little assassin,
but he backfired.
Only God knows.
God and the Center.
When Dannie attacked me, my instinct was to kill him.
But when I looked at him,
he's begging me to shoot him.
I saw someone who might have had a chance,
if The Centre hadn't gotten its claws into him.
You saw yourself.
Looks like Vasquez and Bingham will be going away for a long time.
Think you know a guy and find out you don't really know him at all.
Tell me about it!
Hey.
Thank you for keeping her safe.
I have something for you too.
Charlie, you came home!
So did you, Nickie.
So did you.
This is Sydney.
Do you think it's possible to forget all the terrible things
that happen to us when we were young?
Forget? Oh, no.
But I believe we can make use of them to make ourselves stronger.
I try to be strong.
But sometimes all I see is darkness,
fragments of who I am.
Will I ever feel whole?
I do not know, Jarod.
I hope so.
Me too.

''Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience during the delay...''
- ''We'll now begin boarding our airflight 105 San Diego.''
- Oh, man!
Is there a problem?
I got bumped.
I'm sure it was an accident.
With this many people it's bound to be on attendant physical contact.
No. I got bumped from the flight. They are overbooked.
Oh.
I may miss registration.
You know I became a freshman of Art in San Diego.
Next flight is in five hours.
By then, all the class I need will be closed.
Here, take my seat.
No, no.
Look, I am not in a hurry.
It's not like anybody's chasing me, today.
Take it.
- Oh, man. Are you sure?
- I'm positive.
Thanks.
That's been real pleasure talking to you these last few hours.
You have a bright future ahead of you, Daniel.
Good luck.
Thanks Jarod. I hope you'll find your family.
Thank you.
Thanks, Jarod.
You really saved my life.
What happened to your finger?
Broke in my wrestling.
What did you do last night?
- Sorry to ask.
- Yeah.
Everything alright?
- Mr. Lyle's personal file?
- My father wants a list of anyone who might be Lyle's ally.
Ever since Lyle's death, my father has been lobbying the Triumvirate to take off his position.
But he is running into blue blocks.
The allies of Mr' Lyle know that your father opposed him.
The fact that you killed him only increases their resistance to his promotion.
Even dead, Lyle is pinning the ass.
Something was, excuse me, something was just delivered.
I think you want to see.
This one.
- Lockers?
- Where the hell did these come from?
Jaord sent them.
Class of 1983, Douglas High School.
Townsend, Nebraska.
Why did Jarod send this yearbooks?
Page two.
There is a name tag in my book.
Who is Ricky Sanders?
Professor Tom Greer.
- Oh, god.
- Who did you get?
Mrs. Ricky Sanders.
- I always thought you'd make a nice couple.
- Yeah, when monkeys fly.
Jarod is expecting us to attend this reunion, Mrs. Sanders.
Brilliant inside, Syd.
But then it did make you the professor.
Look at this.
''Always stay the way you are, unless you want to survive.''
That's Jarod telling us for a danger.
Broots, I want to check all the ... in this book.
Until I have more information, I'm not ... in the Armpit Oklahoma.
It's Nebraska.
Hell is hell, Broots.
What's going on?
Flight 105 has crashed near San Diego.
What?
There were fatalities.
Thanks, Jarod. You really saved my life.
There was a young man on board.
I gave him my seat. His name is Daniel Falk.
- I am sorry, sir. I can't just give out...
- please!
Daniel Falk's body was positively identified at the scene. I'm sorry.
Thanks, Jarod. You really saved my life.
There are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
Thitry-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.
How many people died because of what I thought up?
Since I broke up, I spent very moment searching for my past.
He is a pretender.
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
- the Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.
He defends the weak and abused.
Life is a gift.
THE PRETENDER

Episode 17
Crash

DICTATION: ±ż±ż/´Đ´Đ
You are a doctor?
I am today.
Thanks for Lady, fuselage stayed intact.
Kept the body count down.
Clark Thomas.
Jarod Lindsay, NTSB Washington.
I am here to help with the investigation.
I can't get paper close up our request,
but an investigator I don't need that they send to me.
Well, if you like you could get Washington on the phone.
You could tell them yourself what incompetent managers they are.
Diane Post. I prefer able buddies to paper clips, welcome.
We just got these surveillance photos from the crash scene.
Any signs of mechanical problems?
No. The plane passed FA inspection last week.
We are focusing on pilot error.
Both pilots survived?
They've been ... to Centennial Memorial.
- Flight recorder?
- It'll come in a while.
I want to be there when it's opened.
Do I look anything like this Ricky Sanders guy?
If you swallow the blimp.
How did Jarod expect me to fool anyone to believe that I am him?
Just tell them you shut up with Jenny Craig before you married me.
That don't explain the hair.
It's a high school reunion, Broots.
The only thing more pervasive than love handles with smaller ...
What about Mrs. .., pig?
Oh, no photo.
You are not alumni.
Apparently Ricky met his wife overseas.
They both work as missionaries at a catholic charity in Africa.
This amuses you.
That Jarod wants people to believe that you are a missionary.
Broots, did you find anything about Professor Tom Greer?
He was only at the school for one semester in 83.
Taught obscure languages.
He died in Hawaii two years ago.
Rest of class's business is usual.
Oh, last page here there is a list of people under the words ''camera shy''.
Oh, yeah. They didn't have their photo taken.
I tracked them down. There is nothing special.
Except, well, two were dead.
A deader than Townsend, Nebraska.
Call the hotel and book some rooms for the shindig.
Oh, Jarod already did.
There are non-smoking rooms.
Perfect.
Mr. Larson, some questions!
Do you have anything to say to the families of the victims?
My heart goes out to everyone involved.
As a father who almost lost his son, I certainly share their pains.
Can you tell us what happened?
He is not allowed to issue a statement until he talks to the NTSB.
But I would like to offer my prayers to those who lost loved ones.
Excuse us, please. I just want make sure my son gets little rest, okay?
Thank you, thank you very much.
First thing first.
Let us see what the pilot has to say.
She suffered blunt trauma to the temple lobe which affects memory acquisition.
The chances of recording details of the crash are extremely slim.
So there is really nothing you can tell us?
Like I said,
I can remember being on the approach to San Diego.
And I can remember the screams.
But besides that,
I am sorry.
Thank you for your time, Mrs. Wylie. We'll be in touch.
I'll be outside in a second.
You are going to be alright.
It's like somebody painted my mind black.
When I think about my passengers,
maybe it's better that I can't remember.
I want to make a difference of my life.
I read this quote once.
''We have but a rich moment in time.''
It made me realise we aren't here for so long.
Eleven people died.
But I lived.
What makes me so special?
I can remember being on the approach to San Diego.
And I can remember the screams.
Eleven people died.
But I lived.
What makes me so special?
Can you believe how friendly the Nebraskans are?
This isn't Nebraska, Broots. It's a halfway house for ...
Ricky, Ricky, is that you?
You have changed.
You lost a ton, son.
And this must be...
Nobody you want to know.
Well.
Maybe we'll see you and the Mrs later at the hill ride.
Yeah, the hill ride, okay.
A way to blend in.
All set.
Now this is mine. And 305 is for you two.
- You two?
- Small town, Mrs. Sanders.
The last thing we want is for people to wonder why you're not staying with your husband.
There'll better be booze in the courtesy bar, or someone is going to pay.
Hey.
I thought we've agreed that I would be here when we open these boxes.
We couldn't locate you and time isn't some we have a lot over around here.
Evidence from the flight data recorder indicates the elevators were set at a wrong angle for landing.
Giving the flight we do speed on descent,
fail of the elevators to provide proper lift led directly to the crash.
- Who set the elevators?
- We don't know.
- The cockpit voice recorder is still in lock.
- Malfunction. Never started recording on take off.
I've never heard of this happening before.
It is rare, but not without presence.
Hell that happened on the flight I piloted once.
At least now, with no mechanical malfunction,
we can focus on pilot error.
Which leaves the question.
Which pilot?
My dad tells me how to play.
You never play basketball with your dad?
I just want my parents proud.
You did, Daniel.
You did.
''Airista Crash Claims Eleven Lives''
''Pilot Error Questioned''
''Families Grieve''
I don't know if I'll ever be able to climb to the cockpit again.
You get no argument from me. You're gonna be far too busy in Airista.
Brandon is one day going to take over the organisation.
Sooner I get him behind the desk, the better.
Mr. Larson, we need to question Brandon alone.
Well, I am not here as the head of the airline, and here as Brandon's father.
We will appreciate that, sir, but this is standard procedure.
Fine, if you need me, I'll be in the waiting room.
Brandon.
The voice recorder on your flight aren't function.
We have no record of what happened in the cockpit.
Mrs. wylie suffered a head trauma. Therefore your memory of the event is critical.
We'd like you to carefully take ... of last few minutes before the crash.
We just received final approach instructions.
I was focused on my checklist.
Everything seemd calm.
And all the sudden, we stalled.
Angela was yelling about the mountain.
I looked down my window, just to see the wings slash into trees.
You seem to be very warm.
Would you like some water?
No, no.
No, it's this pain killers.
Made me a little fevers.
Anyway, I can only guess some of our gauges are malfunctional.
According to the flight data recorder, all systems were working fine.
It indicated the elevators were set at 0 instead of 20 degrees.
That's why the plane stalled on its descend.
Oh, god.
What is it?
- Is there something on your mind?
- This is really hard.
Angela is a good friend. We've logged over half million miles together.
But?
When I called out ''elevators 20 degrees'' on the checklist,
Angela gave me a positive.
I guess she just wasn't paying attention.
Look, Jarod, it was pilot error.
- And the pilot seems to be Angela Wylie.
- Maybe.
The guy tells exactly what happened and what do you need.
He said he was on pain killers.
Principal actions of those compounds are analgesics and sedation.
Wouldn't cause a fever.
Isn't that possible that guy's just nervous rack?
Pilots are human.
If I've just been in the plane crash, and I detained my friend,
I'll be sweating too.
Is that what you really belive, Diane?
You know, Miss Parker, if you look at this like a mini vacation from the Center,
you may actually enjoy yourself.
These people are dead from neck up and don't even know it.
Why?
Because the couple in the lobby were married for 14 years and they go to church on sunday,
and they coach little league?
I wish my exwife and I had been that lucky.
Just how hard did you fall on your head when you fall from the turnip truck?
Okay. What's so great about your life?
You're forced to stay at the Center until you catch a guy they stole from his parents.
You drown by the murder of your mother.
Competing for your father's attention with a ball headed lunatic dragging with oxygen tank then you...
Careful!
I am just saying,
I'd take a sunday sermon and a little league game any day with all that.
Hey.
Jarod sent us another yearbook,
marking down the page that list the students
who are absent for the graduation picture.
''Not every picture tells a story'', what does that mean?
He wants us to focus on the ''camera shy''.
Coming?
Dear?
The blood test on you and Brandon were negative.
So there will be felony charges but...
You will be charged with negligence.
I suggest you contact the pilot's union and arrange for legal council.
Oh, my god.
Angela.
The voice recorder malfunctioned.
The only thing we have to go on is Brandon's testimony.
If there is anything at all that you can remember.
I can't remember anything.
The voice recorder did not function?
The imprints are already demagnetized.
Hi. How are you doing? Hey.
Any look with the ''camera shy''?
I found two. Both are for village idiot of that year.
- You?
- I met one.
Farmer's wife, seven kids, wallet full of pictures.
And guess whom he's married to?
Zena. What's your secret?
You gonna ask her.
I've never met a missionary before.
There is a shocker.
And Ricky! Who ever thought he became a man of God.
You know, he and I dated a few times.
Has he ever mentioned me?
He often remind this about,
playing tongues on hockey with you in the barn after the saturday night hoot nannie.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Before we come to the end of this wonderful evening,
I'd like to take a moment to remember a couple of students who no longer with us
because the Lord ... to call them on home.
The first is,
- Diana Hydra.
- Oh, god. It's almost over.
And we're not close to knowing why Jarod sent us here.
And when we start.
If you may remember he died ... in the senior year.
So we don't have a graduation photo of Bobby Bowman.
But we were able to enlarge a picture from a group shot of the Farmers of Tomorrow club.
- I'm out of here.
- Miss Parker!
Oh, my god.
This resemblance is unmistakable.
Bobby Bowman is Mr. Lyle?
Are you sure this is Brandon Larson's file?
This lab has zero tolerance for error. The stakes were too high.
Something doesn't make sense.
Brandon Larson's last FAA physical macrostatic blood count was ten.
But in this test you took after the crash, the count is fifteen.
I thought macrostatic blood counts never vary.
They don't.
Who brought in these blood samples?
Your chief investigator, Clark Thomas.
Don't let Jarod's wild speculations confuse you.
And what about Brandon's sweating?
He said pain killers wouldn't do that.
Diane, listen that the evidence is very clear.
Just have that report ready to go in the morning.
One ... tried to give me illegal payoff.
But my dad was telling me you can never go wrong doing the right thing.
I turned him down.
What did your dad teach you, Clark?
You saved my life...
Thanks, Jarod, you really saved my life.
Sydney.
A young man died because of me.
I gave my seat on airplane.
The plane crashed.
I am sorry.
Jarod, we all want to believe that we can control the events in life.
But it's only an illusion.
He had everything to live for.
Family.
Future.
Now he is gone.
I am still here.
I am afraid you and I could spend the rest of this lifetime debating fate, Jarod.
Lifetime?
Is that how long this will hurt?
Anything?
- I found a police file on Bobby Bowman according to the Omaha's coroner's records ...
- Up here, Broots.
Omaha's coroner reported Bobby Bowman was murdered sixteen years ago.
By his father.
Mr. Lyle, Bobby Bowman it is, faked his own murder,
and framed his father?
And I thought my family was screwed up.
Bowman's body was found headless and in the bed of his father's pick-up truck.
But the body was so decomposed that they couldn't get the proper ID.
Have lost sound trace of dental records and of course,
decomposition would make fingerprint identification impossible.
So, if the body was not Mr. Lyle's, then,
whose body was it?
Broots, go back to the Blue Cove, see if you can find out Lyle's early years in the Center.
- And us?
- You and I are gonna pay a visit to Mamie Elkem.
Bobby was adopted, you know.
Bobby was a good little boy for the most part.
And then when he was around fifteen years old,
something just seemed to snap.
Okay, boys, come and get it.
One day, he was sweet sugar.
The next, mean as a snake, violent too.
After a while, my husband just couldn't deal with him.
He felt Bobby need a discipline.
So he started to lock him in the shed out in the back.
I felt that was a little harsh.
But as my husband said,
the roof didn't leek and there was no vermin in it.
You two dogs stop that barking and get in here.
This's a friend of Bobby's?
Oh, Jimmy Radloff. But he died.
That was a sad day for Bobby.
How did Jimmy die?
Bobby and Jimmy went hiking one day.
They got separated.
Only Bobby came home.
Jimmy just disappeared without a trace.
Well, they looked all over for him but they never found his body.
I've heard enough!
Hey! You don't stop your howling...
Now we know whose body Lyle used to frame his dad.
Personally, I felt that Jimmy ran off and away.
He came from a terrible family.
His father was a drunkard and his mother, well,
Lyle and I always thought she was deaf ...
Lyle?
That's my husband's name.
Although he insisted Bobby called him mister.
Angela? They told me the hospital you've been released that...
May I come in?
It's kind of dark in here, don't you think?
That's not the answer.
All that I've ever wanted to do is be a pilot.
They were preliminaries findings.
Nothing has been decided.
No. They already told me to get an attorney.
That's standard procedure.
That will be civil sues.
I can't face those families.
Listen to me.
I don't believe that the crash was your fault.
Based on what?
Those people who had their lives taken from them, they had no choice.
Don't dishonour their memory by taking your own.
Give me the chance to prove you are innocent.
Once Jimmy Radloff disappeared,
Bobby really got bad.
Though there was no control of him except lock him in the shed.
He hit his father with a shovel once.
I'm pretty sure that that was this ... push Lyle to kill Bobby.
And cut off his head?
Well, I did think that was a bit extreme.
Where is your husband now?
Solitary confinement, Topeka Penitentiary.
Lyle rubs people the wrong way.
I best get supper on...
The shed measures eight by ten.
Same as a prison cell.
If my father had locked me at a hole like this,
I wouldn't have framed him, I would've killed him.
Clearly Mr. Lyle was driven to influence slower functioned.
Unfortunately he didn't confine his need to just his father.
I am sorry to bother you, sir.
But I've received the rather disturbing tip.
That your son was using prescription drugs, not on the FAA authorize list.
- It is ridiculous.
- Maybe so.
But accusation is so serious that going to require an investigation.
I assure you if my son've done anything that foolish, I would know about it.
You have any idea how many flight truckies are barking for a seat in the cockpit for their major career?
I know some who had no trouble lieing to get pilot grounded, open up a slot...
I am sure that's true.
Why would he jeopardise his future by taking unauthorized drugs?
Besides, I wouldn't allow him to.
I have no choice on this matter.
You always have the choice.
Tell it to the victims of flight 105.
- Clark Thomas.
- Jarod Lindsay was just here.
He said he is going forward with an investigation to rumours that my son is using unauthorized prescription drugs.
- Where did he hear that?
- I don't know. It doesn't matter. What does matter,
is the fact that you promised to have this thing off, agree?
Yes, sir.
Then get on it.
''Reconstructing Data, Demagnetizing Cylinder''
My gilr-friend gave me this.
She is afraid I'm gonna forget her.
It is nice known to have somebody care so much about you.
Besides folks, you know I mean.
Yep.
''Data Reconstruction Complete''
Our elevators are at zero degrees. I told you to put two notches.
- We're not gonna clear that way...
- I'm sorry, Angela...
- Pull up, pull up.
- I am sorry, Angela! Oh, My God!
I told you to put two notches. We're not gonna clear that way.
Pull up, pull up.
Our elevators are at zero degrees. I told you to put two notches.
We're not gonna clear that way.
- Pull up, pull up.
- I am sorry, Angela! I forgot. I'm sorry, Oh, My God!
Our elevators are at zero degrees. I told you to put two notches. We're not...
This's your idea of sick joke?
No.
My idea of a sick joke is lying to protect your career while destroying Angela Wylie's.
You are crazy.
Am I?
She didn't cause the crash.
You did.
It wasn't your blood that Clark Thomas took to the lab.
You were flying alright.
And what? Speed?
Methamphetamines to sharpen your senses?
So why you're sweating so badly.
That's not true.
Did you know that Angela was thinking of taking her own life,
because she couldn't deal with the guilt of killing eleven people?
Shall we let her?
Rounded up to a nice even dozen?
All because of you.
I'll see you can take a position at Airista and make your father happy.
There is no room for error with my father.
You have to be perfect.
And if you're not, he just bribe Clark's tongue to fix it, right?
He found about my drug intake after the crash.
And it's routine he's been control like he controls everything else.
He picked my schools, my girlfriends, my career.
So how much works does he have to get before you say no?
You don't understand.
Nobody says no to my father.
Not me, not Clark Thomas, no one.
Don't you think it's time that someone did?
So Mr. Bowman, tell us about your son, Bobby.
Bobby.
I hated that little bastard.
But I didn't kill him.
Who did?
If I knew that, I wouldn't be in here, would I?
If I'd bet I'd say it was probably that counselor that started coming around when Bobby was fifteen years old.
From the adoption agency.
Said he was checking up to see how Bobby was getting along.
But Bobby was getting along fine till he showed up.
They started spending time together.
Too much time.
Do you remember anything about this counselor?
Oh, my lawyer tried to find him ever after I was arrested.
But he never worked for the adoption agency.
Oh, I think no.
These padlock cutouts on the wall,
what do they signify, Mr. Bowman?
Somebody's idea of sick joke.
They've been showing up once a month ever since I got here.
I use them to keep track of time.
Except for the last month when they stopped coming.
That's because Mr. Lyle is dead.
Diane.
I want you to hear something.
Clark? It's Jarod.
There is something I want to see you about.
A jump plane? At least you can take me up a plane with a door.
What are you doing here?
Lindsay called, said he found something at the crash site you wanted me to see.
Oh, good.
Everyone is here.
Shall we?
I am sorry, Mr. Larson. There must be a misunderstanding.
Oh, there has been no misunderstanding.
I've uncovered some new evidence about what caused the crash.
What kind of new evidence?
The kind you have to see to believe.
Gentlemen.
- Why are we so low?
- Better to simulate the descent of flight 105.
Hey, will you take over for a minute?
I have to go in the back.
Why don't you take my seat? It'll get a better view.
What new evidence could he have found?
There was nothing left on that mountain. The head has already been examined.
Alright, what the hell is this all about?
Jarod?
Jarod.
He jumped!
What the hell is going on here?
Pull up, get out of the tour.
I can't. It's jammed.
The hydraulic is ...
Problem, boys?
Well, now you know how Angela Wylie felt when she realised she was going to crash.
Now there is a way for you to survive.
But it comes at a price.
What do you want?
Truth.
About how you bribed Clark Thomas to cover for the fact that was really your son,
that caused the crash of flight 105.
Speechless, ah?
Careful. The voice recorder is taking down everything you say.
Only Clark won't be able to demagnetize the voice cylinder.
70 seconds to impact.
If they find what's left in the plane,
they will do toxicology test on your bodies.
Anything you got to hide, Mr. Larson?
Oh, it's too bad.
Because Clark won't be around to temper with the blood tests.
50 seconds.
Damn it, Jarod!
Okay, I did it, I took the bribe.
Now unlock the slabs.
What about you, Mr. Larson?
Larson, tell him, damn it.
Is your reputation more important to you than your life?
Larson.
We are going to crash, tell him.
Alright, it's solved.
I bribed Clark Thomas to protect my son.
Clark, there is a toggle switch underneath your seat.
Push it backward.
I was close. Just let you know,
there is only enough gas in your tank to get you back San Diego.
Oh, by the way, there is a police car waiting for you when you get there.
I am not buying your theory about Mr. Lyle's, Syd.
Please, Miss Parker, listen.
All I am saying is as if Lyle was able to fake his death as a teenager,
well, perhaps he has done it again.
And that's what Jarod has been trying to tell us all this time,
that Lyle is alive.
I shot the son of bitch myself, Sydney.
I saw him fall into the river, you and I were there together when they dragged his body from the water.
A headless body.
So?
- Exactly the way he faked his death the last time.
- There is no last time, the man is dead.
There is nothing on Lyle.
Except for date of employment and date of termination.
But I did find this under the name of Bobby Bowman.
It's a copy of adoption paper giving custody of Bobby, Mr. Lyle, to the Bowman's.
It's only one reason the Center would have records of Lyle's adoption.
They arranged it.
- I'll get Lyle's body exhumed...
- Oh, no, no, you can't.
The Center had Lyle's body cremated.
''Plane Crashed Cover-up Revealed''
Thank you, Jarod.
You saved my life.
Can I help you?
Oh, Daniel.
My name is Jarod.
I met Daniel while we were waiting for the plane.
It was overbooked and he was going to get bumped.
He was worried about missing his registration.
I don't understand.
I gave your son my seat on the flight.
I am so sorry.
I just thought youˇ­
I should probably go.

Thanks, Jarod.
You really saved my life.

Jarod, your transfer came in.
Yes, I'm sorry to be leaving.
Well, you shouldn't miss out the fireworks.
Did you hear about this? Dr. Mitchell was arrested last night
for killing the administrator and making it look like Panalex overdoing.
I heard Dr. Jekyll confessed ...?
I guess takes his own medicine.

Hello.
Mysterious Mr. Harper...
So that's how you look without the beard.
What do you want?
Cooperation.
Two million by this time tomorrow,
or the next time you see little Patrick will be wearing the toe tag.
I'll give you whatever you want.
Please, don't hurt my son.
There are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-Six Hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.
How many people died because of what I thought up?
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.
He is a pretender.

DICTATION: ±ż±ż/´Đ´Đ
You are a doctor?
I am, today.
The rules are simple.
No law, no media.
Break a rule, Patrick dies.
I'll pay you.
Just please, don't hurt my son.
Look behind the phone book.
Two million in twenty-four hours.
I will call you with the details.
Tell Patrick that his father loves...
''THE HAYVENHURST SCHOOL ''
George Harper.
Patrick.
''Raising a Child with Dyslexia''
''Forbes
Invisible genius:
mysterious billionaire
Geroge Harper''
''Out of sight for decade, George Harper plans breakthrough computer language''
''Last known photo, George Harper in 1980''
George Harper.
''#1 DAD''
You are going to be ok, Patrick.
You are lucky I don't kill you now.
Your hands.
- Who the hell are you?
- George Harper.
You tell that to someone who's not his head security.
Now that's try this again.
Who are you?
That's Jarod, alright?
Clarkston Pharmaceuticals.
It makes a very popular anti-depressant, called Panalex.
Jarod was an employee there for three weeks.
- Who did he help?
- Nobody.
Well, he wasn't stealing the formula for ... vitamins.
Hold on your jockeys
A major shareholder in Clarkston is...
Mr. Raines?
Everyone needs a nest egg.
Continue.
It is a sound lead.
It means nothing until we find Jarod's emotional purpose.
Jarod's purpose is to harass the Center.
He's after my stock.
If he were after your stock, you'd be broke.
Jarod is driven by altruism.
You want him out there trying to help the Little Guy?
The answer is the Little Guy.
If you want to find Jarod, find the person he's trying to help.
I want my dad...
Is he going to make it?
It's too soon to tell.
But he's going to be there about for at least two more weeks.
Look, Doc, I was a little rough on you back there, but...
You want Patrick back just as much as his father does.
I understand.
You said the kidnapper left a cell phone for you.
- From now on, I occupy myself some.
- Mr. Alambar.
He saw me.
By becoming George Harper, I brought the boy one more day of life.
I want you to tell me how that happened.
Mr. Harper got a note after three.
He called me, said to meet at the phone booth.
A limo drops off Patrick every morning to school,
picks him up in the afternoon.
Today,
the driver found only this.
Did you talk to this limo driver?
He found the backpack where Patrick usually waits.
We've known this guy for years, he's been with us for a long time.
But I've been running new backfround check on him just in case.
Mr. Harper is ready to pay off this bastard.
But I know how these people think.
I'm a ex FBl, worked a few abductions.
More than likely,
they'll probably kill Patrick just he won't ID them.
He is a professional.
He wants us to feel a total loss of control,
so he can fulfill his fantasy of power.
What do you know about kidnappers, doctor?
When I was a boy,
I was stolen from my parents.
I can help you get Patrick back.
But you'are going to have to trust me.
Otherwise by this time tomorrow, Patrick could be dead.
Keep the phone.
For now.
''Patrick''
A lunch box!
You will be starting special school soon, Jarod.
It's that why those teachers came to see me yesterday.
Yes, it is. They say you have a gift.
Of course I already knew ...
You are gonna love it, Jarod.
I am so proud of you, and I'm the proudest mummy in the world.
''THE HAYVENHURST SCHOOL''
Is there something I can help you with?
You are a teacher?
I am George Harper.
Oh, this is quite an honor. I am Judith Peck.
Heavenhurst is a much better place since your scholarship funds...
You opened the school to a member of disadvantaged students.
- I'm sorry if I seemed a little surprised to see you.
- I understand.
I am here about my son.
This is Martin Benton. He oversees security for this school.
I am so sorry about this, Mr. Harper.
Nothing like this has ever happened here, sir.
I am shocked.
I stongly urge to call the police.
I cannot.
It is one of the kidnapper's demands.
If I could just find something, anything that would help...
He was in session after school.
- Reading studies, I think.
- Reading studies?
- For the dyslexia?
- Right, he gets off around three.
They were special led kids, most of the others' gone by two.
He doesn't want to be single out.
He hates being special.
Right, he just wants to be a regular kid.
That's why he always reads his comic books in class.
This is where he usually waits for his ride.
- In there, right, Judith?
- Right.
Is there anything we can do, Mr. Harper?
Yes, Nothing.
Do not contact the police or the media.
I beg of you.
- Patrick's life depends on it.
- Of course.
I was stolen.
Taken from my home in middle of the night.
It's all coming back to me, Sydney.
Repressed memories.
They often resurface during traumatic events, Jarod.
But those memories themselves, they are not as important as how you face them.
How do you face yours?
How do you live with what happened to me?
Jarod, nothing can justify what happened to you.
But what've you been doing out there in the wide world for the last two years
tells me something right...
It came out of something very very wrong.
It's like a nightmare.
Now it keeps coming back in pieces.
First, the fear.
And then, the panic.
Shooting to your nerves that night
I'm a child again.
It's dark,
and I'm alone.
All I can think about is seeing my family again.
I want my world to be like it was.
When can I see my daddy?
Harper will pay, and you will get your cut.
Tomorrow.
Um, the kid is having his last meal right now.
You are late.
Clarkston Pharmaceuticals...
Jarod was a national rep in ... in Sunnyvale, California.
You've found any evidence of child abduction?
Why would he, Syd?
A hunch.
Play the tape, Mr. Broots.
Sydney, they made me do this.
How do you live with what happened to me?
Jarod, nothing can justify what happened to you.
But what've you been doing out there in the wide world for the last two years
- tells me something right...
- It came out of...
And for two years I have been saying you personal connection with Jarod has hindered this pursuit.
This is proof.
My conversations with Jarod are nothing new.
They keep us from him.
They keep him from disappearing.
Sydney...
He's right.
Two million.
I got what I could from Patrick's room like you asked.
But I still don't see how it helps.
I'm going to be George Harper.
I have to understand his life and the son's.
I don't want the kidnapper to catch me on the lie.
The limo driver is clean.
I checked his past business associated with possible motives.
Nothing.
FBl files show no kidnappers with a simple ...
At least, not the last five years.
All we can do is hoping bastard keep his word and let Patrick back tomorrow.
This is Patrick's mother?
Chloe. A great lady.
Passed away in 96.
Patrick loves puzzles.
They help him to think.
That's what he always says.
I bought him this one.
Sometimes Mr. Harper's working late, I help Patrick out.
Yeah, well, kind of kids ... faster than me.
Are you ok?
Dozen abductions I worked for the bureau...
I think some of these guys do to those kids just a...
We'll get him back.
''Patrick''
Patrick.
Patrick.
Jarod.
He's waking up.
Mr. Harper, my name is Jarod.
He's going to help us, Mr. Harper.
Is Patrick here?
No, sir.
He is not.
But he's going to be just fine.
I promise you.
Syd, we've been ordered to Sunnyvale.
Broots found this.
Could be Jarod's attended work. We'll leave in an hour.
Raines' sending Willie with us to keep us honest about what he doesn't know,
that Sam is already on his way.
I will be ready.
I hate myself for siding with Raines,
but the Creep's got a point.
The emotional umbilical you have with Jarod is ...
becoming a problem.
In your eyes.
Jarod is doing your work out there, isn't he?
- I could say the same about you.
- Um.
His mind games don't work on me any more.
You cann't make that claim.
Like you said,
we've been ordered to Sunnyvale.
Has the kidnapper called? Where is my boy?
He'll be back by the end of the day, sir.
When he was a new born,
I was going to his room in the night to check on him.
I standed over him,
until my eyes were adjusted to the dark.
When I saw him breath, I knew he was ok.
New parents, they must be very nervous.
New?
I still check on Patrick every night.
But what could it do? I should have been there.
If you had been there, you would've found the backpack not your driver.
That's all.
Yes, since Chloe died, it's just Patrick and me.
I lost her in a room just like this.
I promised to her we'll be a strong family.
Jarod.
I'll get him back.
Need some help?
I am sorry.
I was just trying to put myself into Patrick shoes.
Well, you are in the right place. He always read his comic books right here.
You must be lost.
The kidnapper calls in less than 2 hours.
I went to see Harper. You weren't there.
- What are you doing here?
- I am following you.
- Why weren't you at the hospital?
- I have two hours left.
- There is still some time.
- Time for what?
For this.
He was here.
He was buying comic books here. The kidnapper grabbed him over here.
He emptied out the backpack,
put a note inside and he left it across the street for the driver to find.
And nobody saw a thing.
Almost nobody.
So that's how your doctors do a sugar rush.
There, Patrick.
No plates!
The tape is useless.
This kidnappers coverd his face.
We are down to the wire.
Got it.
I want to check up on Harper before we get the call.
I almost butt your little blow up back there.
That was my office on the phone.
And when I ran a background check on the driver, I ran one on you too.
You're a tough man to track, Dr. Pearce.
Maybe that's cos you died in 1979.
You didn't pretend to be Harper in that phone booth,
you made a deal with the kidnapper.
How much is he paying you?
Look, I know that you think about Patrick like he was your own son.
And you probably saw some pretty horrible things happened to children when you worked for the FBI.
You are afraid the same thing is going to happen to him.
But I swear to you all that I want to do is to help this boy.
And I can't help him unless I answer this phone call.
Please, trust me.
George Harper.
Same phone booth, ten minutes.
Ten minutes.
Miss Parker, I've got him.
Go, go.
The kidnapper's probably watching.
Get off here. I'll maintain visual.
You plan anything, I'll kill you.
I expected nothing less.
I am here, I am here.
Take the money across the street to the green garbage can.
- When do I see Patrick?
- As soon as I get paid.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Where is my son?
Hello.
Harper, I said no law.
What are you talking about?
The deal is off, the boy is dead.
No, no, no.
You are a businessman.
Just name your price, I'll pay it.
Another two million in three hours.
I see one badge,
your son stops breathing.
I want to talk to my son.
I want to know that he is still alive.
I love you, daddy.
Intelligent boy you got, Mr. Harper.
Who says he need special led?
Keep the phone, I'll call.
- What happened? What the hell was that?
- It must be one of the kidnappers.
Look, he wants another two millions in three hours.
You got to get it.
Now you know who you can trust.
Can we trust this guy? How do we know we can trust this guy?
We still have two hours left.
Exponential algorithms.
Yeah, I used to try to solve those since a boy.
Those took my minds some place else.
Just like Patrick uses puzzles.
I never looked it like that.
We're going to find him.
He knew.
He knew.
He said this to me just before he hang up.
He knew that Patrick was in a special classes.
He knew that he would be held after school late.
But how did he know that he would be there alone?
Must be someone in this god-forsaken hospital who seeing Jarod.
- Find anything?
- Bingo.
''Dr. Charles Mitchell, Respected Physician Arrested in Panalex Murder''
Excuse me.
- Have you seen this man?
- Jarod?
Sure, just a second.
Yes, this is Dr. Hargadon. I need to page ... 7477 please, it's an emergency.
So you know Jarod?
- Are you a friend?
- Old friend.
He is upstairs. I am headed that way.
Come on.
Jarod's transfer came in today.
But he still has one more patient.
Well, it's like he had the patient moved.
This is..., Syd.
If I know Jarod, he is right under my nose.
Oh, swing in the miss.
- Sam, ... close in the downstairs.
- Yes, Miss Parker.
Broots, Sydney, come with me.
- Thank you.
- Obviously you got my page.
Thank you to help me keep my work a secret.
Wait a minute. You are the one who got Dr. Mitchell confessed?
Yes, I am sorry that I had to lie to you before.
But I knew that the Pharmaceuticals company would send their lawyers after me.
Lawyers! Well, that explains that woman's attitude problem.
We're not leaving.
Check the employee records, Broots, find out where they're sending Jarod checks.
Okay.
But his last patient was transferred.
It's ..., Syd. Your boy usually thumbs his nose at me.
Could you go?
I can ..., I got the gut feeling.

I want you to take the van.
Get me out of this.
Relax.
You've been kidnapped, just like my son.
- Harper?
- How much is he paying you?
How much is my son's life worth?
Harper, please.
Please get me out of here.
It's too early to beg.
Kidnapping victims, they usually last five point eight minutes before desperation sets in.
First, they have to face the overwhelming fear.
And just like my son, you're wondering where is he going to take me,
is he going to kill me or is he just going to torturing me?
Let me go!
You are begging again.
You moved the student pickup to the north side of the school.
What you made sure Patrick didn't know about it.
He was out there all alone.
You supervised the kidnapping, didn't you?
I don't know what you are talking about.
I have a surveillance video from where my son buys his comic books.
Now, you tell me how much he is paying you.
A hundred thousand.
Where is Patrick?
He'll kill me.
Not if I do it first. Where is he?
Money or no money, he is gonna kill Patrick.
No.
Where is that leave you now?
Where is he?
He is in an abandoned warehouse.
Across the street fromt the phone booth.
He is watching me.
Yes, yes.
Jarod, what's happening? We got less than thirty minutes.
I know where Patrick is.
- Where are you?
- At your place.
- Has anyone been there looking for me?
- No.
I'll meet you there.
- Man.
- Jarod, run! Run!
No.
Miss Parker, there is a little boy.
He's been kidnapped.
He needs my help.
Won't work this time.
They'll kill him.
- Let the police take care of him.
- They don't know about it.
Get Jarod to the car.
Sydney, please.
Please don't let this happen.
This is just only stole me when I was a little boy, please.
I want to see my mummy. Let me go.
It is over.
How did you face your past, Sydney?
Miss Parker.
- I'll take it from here.
- Like how you will.
- If you have a problem, talk to Mr. Raines.
- Back off.
Don't, willie!
I am hit. I'm hit.
- Jarod, stop!
- Parker!
Please.
We're sorry. The mobil unit you have dialed is either outside of...
Now, I am gonna kill your son.
And you're going to watch.
You can handle that, Mr. Harper?
I am not Mr. Harper.
I am so proud of you.
I am the proudest mummy in the world.
It's over, Patrick.
It's over.
It's over.
- Dad!
- Patrick!
Let me look at you.
- How are you, ah?
- I'm okay.
Unacceptable.
Jarod escaped because of you, Miss Parker.
Not at all.
Parker caught Jarod.
Willie botched it. That's what my report would say.
How do you think my father will react when he reads that?
This isn't over.
You can bet your bald head on that.
I can fight my own battle, Sydney.
I knew you did the right thing with Jarod.
You know,
Sydney,
sometimes I wonder if you do want him out there,
helping the little guy.
I want him back as much as you do.
I just don't want hin dead.
''Kidnapper Captured-Accomplice Found in Abandoned Van''
Those people who were looking for you,
they think you're pretty valuable.
As far as I concerned, you died in 1979.
Wow.
Are you looking for this?
Yes, the piece.
Looks like a perfect fit.
And you will make a great father some day.

I was wondering if you gentlemen might have seen him.

DICTATION: ±ż±ż/´Đ´Đ
You are a doctor?
I am, today.
''Dead End''
So much for anonymous tips about Jarod.
The guy said that we would find what we wanted right here.
If we were looking for a urban blight and the the overwhelming stench of urine,
he was right on the money.
You think we're being led astray?
Thank you, Sherlock.
The pink?
Oh, I let Debbie do the larudry.
She kind of got the colours mixed with the whites.
And I donˇŻt want to hurt her feelings.
DonˇŻt let her cut the grass.
I want a team to sweap the area.
I want everything within a fifty-foot radius brought back to the Centre.
Miss Parker.
There are something here you should see.
Miss Parker.
Parker, you alright?
Your motherˇŻs identification card,
and the expiration date has been changed.
It seems Jarod has cultivated a darker sense of humour since we last spoke.
Did I miss something?
The new expiration date.
ThatˇŻs the same day her mother was killed.
Everyone whoˇŻs arrested has the privilege of making one phone call.
YouˇŻre not under arrest. YouˇŻre being detained for questioning.
About what?
Sheriff Delmont will explain it all to you when he gets back.
This is crazy.
Just go with the flow
and nobody will get hurt.
Miss Miller, come quick. It is J.R.
J.R.? What happened?
We were tossing around a football by the church and he just passed out.
- Well, go get Dr. Kraner.
- HeˇŻs gone to Tucson for the day.
We got JR inside the church, but heˇŻs out cold.
I have some medical training.
This is my son we are talking about.
I can help.
J.R.
You kids get back. Get back.
J.R. honey!
Sweetie, can ou hear me?
- J.R.
- He is in shock.
- HeˇŻs still breathing.
- He is hypoglycemic.
When was the last time he ate?
Oh, he had cereals for breakfast 3 or 4 hours ago.
Only water since he was here.
Is he going to be okay?
J.R.
Come on, honey!
What do you think youˇŻre doing? ?
I need to stabilize his blood sugar.
IˇŻll stick this in your mouth. I want you to let it dissolve, okay?
Good boy.
Mum.
It's ok, honey.
It's ok.
Everything is going to be ok.
How is he feeling?
Better.
He has a heart condition.
I noticed the bluish tint to his fingertips and his lips.
I would say, by the looks of it, itˇŻs congenital.
You have a very sick boy.
Are you a doctor?
Not at the moment.
Why hasnˇŻt he had a heart transplant?
Because he's on the waiting list.
Because he has AB negative blood, which is very rare.
It only happens in certain families.
One in three hundred thousand.
I know.
I have it too.
This is the guy?
- ''Message received.
Will meet in DRY RIVER as requested. Hopes remain high.
Jarod''
- I may have found Jarod. I received this email from him today.
And you said you didn't send this ''refuge'' message to Jarod?
If I had, would I be showing it to you?
That's a good point.
What is this Dry River place, anyway?
According to the computer, there is a Dry River in Southwest Arizona.
This is Parker. Have the jet prepared.
Well, get it out of the Hangar.
- Forget it! Just book me a seat on the next commercial flight to...
- To Phoenix.
Phoenix, and IˇŻll pick up the ticket at the gate.
Uh, youˇŻre going alone?
I'm a big girl, Broots.
Have this stuff analysed by Cousin It.
Angelo.
I donˇŻt like dead ends, Sydney,
especially when they concern my mother.
Hold this.
Then he helped J.R. back to the squad car, and we brought him back here.
A touching story.
Sheriff, he had every opportunity to escape,
but he didnˇŻt even think about running.
- What's your point?
- He helped save my son.
Surely there is another way we can handle this.
There's not.
You did a decent thing for the boy and IˇŻm grateful.
But if you give me one second of trouble, IˇŻm going to shoot you dead.
You understand me?
Completely.
Well, let's go.
''Dry River''
ItˇŻs a lucky thing I showed up here today.
Your deputy has a pretty sick boy on her hands.
He could have died.
It must be difficult, watching someone you love suffer like that.
What about you,sheriff?
You have any family?
I think itˇŻs going to be a whole lot easier if you and I donˇŻt get to know each other.
Get out. Let's go.
Go straight.
Move! Go right over there.
Stay there.
Let's go.
Go on.
- Somebody cut themselves?
- Sit down over there.
Look, itˇŻs pretty obvious by the way IˇŻve been treated that something terrible has happened.
Why donˇŻt you tell me what it is?
- I cann't.
- Why not?
Because I wonˇŻt let him.
Lyle.
Gone but not forgotten.
And so it begins.
This is all the stuff brought in from the dead end street.
You think he'll be able to help?
Empaths possess such fine-tuned instincts, Broots,
they canˇŻt be hurried.
Or discouraged.
Or grossed out apparently.
I think Jarod believes the initial refuge signal to be authentic.
Add to that the phoney tip on his recent whereabouts,
it becomes clear that someone has lured him to Arizona.
- Jarod could be in serious trouble.
- I believe yes.
The question is from whom?
Angelo, could you give it a rest already?
Wait.
He cann't pick it up.
Why?
The person Angelo is empathing
doesn't have a thumb.
How long have I been out?
A couple of hours.
Oh, thatˇŻll be a good one.
You sent the message.
You really are a genius.
How did you find out about refuge?
You forget. Before I found myself thumbless in the desert
I was head rat at the cheese factory.
You may have taken off with the DSAs,
but I had access to surveillance videos of every conversation you and Sydney ever had.
I wish you could have seen your face when you first saw me.
It was priceless.
Thumb looks pretty bad.
If you donˇŻt take care of it, you could lose the whole hand.
ItˇŻll be fine.
You seem to have captured loyal support from the locals.
Sheriff Delmont?
Afraid his involvement has less to do with loyalty than it does survival.
I donˇŻt follow.
My first acquisition after arriving in this little oasis
was securing some leverage in the form of Mrs. Delmont.
You kidnapped his wife?
And buried her in the desert.
SheˇŻs currently being fed oxygen
supplied by a five horsepower gas generator,
which with an adapted fuel capacity of fifteen gallons
- should run for about...
- Sixteen hours
Sixteen...
Give or take a few minutes.
When I check my watch,
she should have life support remaining in the area of seven hours and twenty minutes.
YouˇŻll appreciate this:
sheˇŻs pregnant.
I guess about six months.
So you see, our good Sheriff is in no position to be anything but cooperative.
You are insane.
Psychological diagnosis can be really subjective.
- What do you want?
- IsnˇŻt it obvious?
I want everything.
- What?
- Lyle is alive.
- What did you say?
- Angelo had a severe reaction to one of the objects brought in from the dead end street.
IˇŻm certain Lyle is behind all of this.
WeˇŻve been over this, Sydney.
Lyle is dead. I shot him point blank in the chest.
Think about it.
Sydney.
You were there, do you remember?
When they pulled his body from the river?
It was never positively identified, Parker.
Lyle faked his death as a teenager.
He just did it again!
Parker?
Parker?
Look, you got what you wanted.
Let the woman go.
Not until I finalize negotiations.
Negotiations?
The Triumvirate is preparing to meet to choose my permanent replacement.
I intend to make that vote unnecessary.
Look, whereˇŻs a clip-on tie when you need one?
You really think that the CentreˇŻs going to let you just walk right in there like nothingˇŻs happened?
I bring back their Golden Boy
and itˇŻs business as usual.
Cos thereˇŻll have to be changes made, obstacles removed.
Like Sydney and Miss Parker?
Among others.
How long do you think itˇŻs going to be before someone decides to remove you?
NothingˇŻs forever.
However there is a way that we can assure our power base.
We?
With your brains and my leadership skills
there isnˇŻt anything we couldnˇŻt accomplish.
I could be your friend, Jarod.
Like you were my friend when you tried to stop my heart?
Why did you try to kill me?
Hey.
I just got a call from my deputy.
She says thereˇŻs a tall, dark brunette woman
asking questions about someone named Jarod and a man with a missing thumb.
Parker.
And this was going so well.
Nothing is forever.
Well, if you ever want to see that wife of yours again, get rid of her.
Now.
I believe there are two very dangerous men here in Dry River.
You a cop?
I work for a private corporation.
WeˇŻve been tracking these men for some time.
Have you seen them?
Those people dead?
Murdered. Execution style.
And that one?
Jarod.
He has a history of mental illness.
IˇŻve been instructed by his family to bring him home.
I havenˇŻt seen him.
Sheriff, my information is certain.
Dry RiverˇŻs a small town, Madam.
IˇŻm sorry but I canˇŻt help you.
Everything alright?
Oh, everythingˇŻs fine, J.R.
- Hello.
- Hello.
How are you doing, buddy?
IˇŻm tired.
ThatˇŻs why you need to rest.
Come on, IˇŻll make you something to eat.
Nice kid.
WhatˇŻs the matter with him anyway?
HeˇŻs dying.
We have to call somebody.
- Who?
- The FBI, the State police...
To accomplish what? Have you seen this picture?!
The man is a cold-blooded killer! HeˇŻs got my wife buried in the desert!
Yeah, but we canˇŻt just stand here...
HeˇŻs a psycho. If he even thinks that IˇŻm crossing him,
Lyn and the baby are dead.
This really doesnˇŻt surprise me.
WhatˇŻs that?
This rising from the dead game you keep playing.
You pulled the same scam in high school.
Only back then you got really creative:
you murdered your best friend
and then you set your own father up to take the fall.
What do you know about my father?
I know that heˇŻs rotting in a jail cell,
serving a life sentence for a crime you committed.
He got what he deserved.
What about your mum?
Did she deserve what she got?
Did I tell you I went to visit her?
Very nice lady, only she seemed a touch confused.
Seemed she was trying to feed a couple of dogs that didnˇŻt really exist.
You should not have gone there.
She kept your bedroom just the way you left it.
ItˇŻs all very cosy...
One more word and you die.
If you kill me here, youˇŻll have nothing to bargain with.
Which brings us to step two of the process.
Look, I hate to throw a wrench in your plans,
but itˇŻs against the law to impersonate a doctor.
Now thatˇŻs funny.
See IˇŻm going to need something more substantial than photographs
to demonstrate my resolve to the Triumvirate.
An offering, if you will.
Offering?
You should consider yourself fortunate.
YouˇŻll be asleep when I cut off your thumb.
No!
Miss Parker?
SheˇŻs gone.
She showed me a picture of you with a bunch of murdered people.
Casualties of war.
- Is there something else?
- I want my wife back!
You said when you had what you wanted youˇŻd let her go.
Have you ever seen a human being suffocate?
ItˇŻs not an easy way to die.
Now your family has slightly less than three hours of life remaining.
Unless of course you want to arrest me?
Miss Parker!
- She followed me.
- Get rid of her!
Now!
This is private property. Wow!
Sheriff.
I know theyˇŻre here.
Like I said before, Miss Parker, I donˇŻt know what youˇŻre talking about.
Then how did you know my name? I never mentioned it.
I donˇŻt know what heˇŻs holding over your head Sheriff, but trust me.
It will not end well for anyone.
I can help you, if youˇŻd just let me.
I wish I could do that.
YouˇŻre under arrest for trespassing.
Hand over the weapon.
Please.
DonˇŻt do this.
DonˇŻt fight the medication.
ThereˇŻs nothing you can do to stop it now.
Please.
No.
- They said you were dead.
- Not hardly.
They said you were dead.
Not hardly, big brother.
Sydney, this was just delivered for you.
Who is it from?
Receiving. What is it?
What's this?
Who could have taken these?
I decide who lives or dies.
I decide who lives or dies...
I decide who lives or dies...
Kyle.
JarodˇŻs brotherˇŻs alive too?
Man, this is turning into the Night of the Living Dead.
Hi, this is Sydney.
I need seats on the next flight out to Arizona,
and get the Centre helicopter ready for immediate takeoff from Phoenix.
I decide who lives or dies!
I decide who lives or dies.
I thought youˇŻd never wake up.
Kyle?
I thought you were dead!
Yeah, that was the idea.
I saw you in the van.
I saw it explode.
You saw the van explode but I wasnˇŻt inside.
When you escaped I was able to crawl out
and fire a shot into the fuel tank.
My leg was injured so I made my way up to the highway and caught a ride out.
How did you find me?
IˇŻve been following Parker and the others for months, hoping they would lead me back to you.
My thumb, and the rest of me, is glad you did.
Jarod, have you learned anything else about our parents?
Sydney gave me this.
His brother gave it to him before he died.
Our fatherˇŻs name?
I donˇŻt know.
I canˇŻt believe... Where have you been?
In the shadows,
waiting,
watching.
Now that weˇŻre together again I can finish this.
Finish what?
I sent a package of photographs thatˇŻll bring the others here soon.
ItˇŻs almost over, brother.
WeˇŻll start with Lyle.
Kyle, what happened to him?
He tripped and hit his head.
We have less than an hour.
What are you talking about?
Lyle kidnapped a woman and buried her alive somewhere out in the desert.
We have less than an hour before her air supply runs out.
Jarod, we canˇŻt leave now.
This is our chance to end this once and for all.
WeˇŻll start with him.
Did you hear what I said?
There is a woman and her unborn baby buried alive somewhere out in the desert
and if we work together, we can save their lives.
Lyle and the others deserve to die.
And if they do? What chance do we ever have of finding our parents?
Look, I know youˇŻre angry, but thereˇŻs more important things in life than vengeance.
Let me show you how good it feels to save a life
instead of trying to destroy one.
Kyle!
WeˇŻll need to know where they buried her, right?
Relax, brother.
This is what I do.
Hope you like meat loaf.
I live for it.
The sheriff said your son is sick.
He has a heart condition, yes.
I am sorry.
He seemed like a really nice young man.
Yes, he is.
You have to let me out.
I told you I canˇŻt do that.
You know my mother died when I was almost your sonˇŻs age,
and I know how hard it is to lose someone that you care about.
ThatˇŻs why I promise you that the sheriff and anyone else Lyle has involved in this mess will die
unless I walk out of here.
- You donˇŻt understand.
- I understand perfectly, Deputy.
I think that you need to get out there and take another good look at those pictures
because that is exactly what will happen unless you prevent it.
- You donˇŻt know what he wants...
- What?!
What?
HeˇŻs got the sheriffˇŻs wife buried alive out in the desert.
Then we donˇŻt have much time, do we?
We must be close to the place.
Kill the motors.
ThereˇŻs a generator.
ItˇŻs coming from just over that rise.
Come on!
Down there!
There it is!
ItˇŻs out of fuel. Hurry!
Find the feeding tube.
Got it!
Dig!
- ItˇŻs sealed tight.
- Watch it.
Hurry, there canˇŻt be much air left in there!
Ok, that's ok. It's ok.
ItˇŻs okay, youˇŻre safe now.
YouˇŻre safe now.
Going somewhere, Lyle?
Miss Parker.
How nice to see you again.
I wish I could say the same.
What happened to you?
JarodˇŻs little brother wanted some information.
Kyle is here?
We negotiated. I lost.
DoesnˇŻt anybody ever really die any more?
You left that envelope on that sign.
What gave me away?
JarodˇŻs a pain in the ass but heˇŻs not heartless.
ThatˇŻs for my mother,
and this is for me.
God, youˇŻre beautiful when youˇŻre angry.
- Oh, my god.
- Oh Carl!
Are you alright?
I was so scared.
- Where is he?
-We left him chained up at the compound.
IˇŻm going to sit you down.
ItˇŻs going to be alright now, okay?
- What are you going to do?
- What do you think?
Sheriff wait.
Let us handle it.
The man almost killed my family.
Which is exactly why you need to get your wife and baby to a hospital
and make sure theyˇŻre ok.
No.
Now you boys be careful.
DonˇŻt worry Sheriff. IˇŻm no hero.
The Sheriff said the FoundryˇŻs on the edge of town.
- HeˇŻs not in the trailer.
- HeˇŻs not anywhere in the building.
HeˇŻs gone.
Which means heˇŻs out there.
Somewhere.
LetˇŻs head back to the hospital.
I want to see how the sheriffˇŻs wife is doing.
You were right, you know.
About what?
About how it feels to help someone.
When that woman grabbed me after I saved her life and thanked me,
it was like nothing IˇŻd ever felt before.
IˇŻve been angry for so long, so full of rage and revenge
IˇŻd forgotten what it was like to care about someone.
ThatˇŻs all going to change.
Now that weˇŻre together.
And I promise.
Come on, letˇŻs go.
Oh, this is beautiful!
ItˇŻs just one big happy family, isnˇŻt it?!
ItˇŻs the end of the line, Lyle.
ThereˇŻs no place left for you to run.
IˇŻm disappointed in you, Jarod.
You know me better than that.
If thereˇŻs one thing I donˇŻt do easy ¨C itˇŻs die.
Drop the cannon, Kid.
- Shoot him you moron!
- Shut up!
Stay back,
or I put a very large hole in big brother.
Kyle.
Threats and pain
thatˇŻs all youˇŻve ever offered us.
You stole our lives and you killed our spirit, now you think you can threaten us with death?
It doesnˇŻt matter, Lyle.
because we never made a difference anyway.
IˇŻll kill him.
I swear I will.
And then IˇŻll kill you.
DonˇŻt do this, Kyle.
By the way, Lyle,
howˇŻs that knife wound?
You stay with me little brother.
IˇŻm gonna get you to a hospital.
It's too late, Jarod.
DonˇŻt you say that.
Look at me!
Come on, just think...
think about all the good times weˇŻre going to have together.
I'm sorry, Jarod.
For what?
For everything.
No.
ItˇŻs time to come home now, Jarod.
Where is Lyle?
WeˇŻll find him.
Right, nobody move!
Mister, I donˇŻt know who you are but I figure I owe you at least one
get-out-of-jail-free card.
There are two of us Sheriff.
WhatˇŻs to say we wonˇŻt shoot you right now?
Well, mostly because this is a ten gauge pump action shotgun
that will pretty much cut anything in half that itˇŻs aimed at
and right now itˇŻs aimed at you lady!
Jaord.
IˇŻm sorry.
Where will you be taking him?
Some place where he can make a difference.
''Trauma team to ICU on six west...''
- How is he, Dr Ridlin, my son?
- Just fine.
The new heart is functioning on its own and barring complications
your boy should live a long and happy life.
Oh, thank you.
It was a stroke of luck really to find a donor to match your sonˇŻs blood type.
Whoever that donor was, heˇŻs a Godsend.
I donˇŻt know about that, Doc, but he was a hero.
''Anonymous Man Donates Heart to Dying Boy''
Good for you, little brother.
Good for you.

I want a list of people who are on that bus with Jarod.
The uh... bus company says they can't disclose passenger identification.
The bus company says.
You are truly pitiful.
Well, yeah, they have certain privacy regulations, there's a certain protocol that we have to follow.
Daddy?
Daddy?
Well, are you gonna invite me in?
-Hello?
-Of course.
Hello? Miss Parker?
Come in.
I like what you've done with the place.
Your mother would love it.
Oh, that is special.
Is that new?
It was a gift
when I graduated college from you.
You remember.
When you were ten years old.
You'd just come home from your first piano recital.
What was the name of that piece you played? "For Elise".
Bach's Minuet in G.
-Daddy what are you...
-Oh she was so beautiful, like you.
I wish people would remember your mother the way she really was.
They always taint her memory with lies.
Lies?
Yeah, the kind Jarod perpetuates about her, about me.
The truth about Mum is in my heart.
Nothing can change that.
Daddy?
Why are you here?
Well, bad dream.
I was awake all night.
I just ah...
make sure you are alright.
Bach's Minuet in G?
I would love to hear you play that again.
-You sure it was her father?
-Yeah.
Strange that Mr Parker would go back to that house after all these years.
Typically unpredictable.
Working hard I say.
Miss Parker.
Oh, this came for you.
I hear your father came to visit.
- Would you like to talk about it?
- Does it look like I want to talk about it?
Dover Town Bank?
''Something of interest today at 11:00 - "
The secrets to your past.
Jarod.
A letter from your mother?
''March 20th, 1970.''
''I am counting the days until our trip to Europe.''
''How excited I am at the prospect of showing you the world.''
''For now though my friend and I must amend some of the ugliness that exists around us,''
''but I promise you and I will put all of this behind us on April 14th.''
''All my love. Mum.''
April 14th.
The day after Mum died.
Miss Parker?
Oh, oh. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Harold Rosen.
Can I interest you in one of our Easter Annuities or IRA accounts?
Back off Bugs.
Exscuse me.
I'm expecting a package, a letter or something left for me, the name is Parker.
Dad.
Mum sent me here to get the child support.
She said not to leave until you pay.
One of the tellers can assist you.
Easter Annuity?
I guess not.
Mam, I have customers ahead of you. If you'll please wait in line?
Patience has never been one of your virtues, has it, Miss Parker?
You've got quite a set showing up here.
Well, even you wouldn't pull a gun in a bank.
Where did you find that letter?
In the last place you'd expect.
Would you...care to read more?
You son of bitch.
You could have just sent these.
Why drag me down here?
So you wouldn't miss...him.
Morning, Mr Fenigor.
Mr Fenigor! Got to get Jarod and Timmy out of here tonight.
Fenigor?
The man who helped my mother rescue the children at the Centre?
The man who helped your mother try to save me.
He's a regular, comes here every Friday morning. He's been doing it for years.
My friend and I must amend some of the ugliness that exists around us.
He may know who killed my mother.
And who my parents are.
The secrets to both our pasts.
Everybody sit tight!
This is a robbery!
Go down!
Let's go!
You move, you die! Are we clear?
The are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.
How many people died because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent every moment searching for my past.
He is a pretender.
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.
He defends the weak and abused.
Life is a gift.

DICTATION: ±ż±ż/´Đ´Đ
You are a doctor?
I am today.
Move down. Move down.
Let's go. Shut up.
I find one exploding dye pack, somebody's not going home for lunch, you got that?
- What are you doing?
- Ending this thing.
By getting everybody killed?
The sooner they get their money and leave the sooner we get the answers from Fenigor.
Listen to me people, nobody speaks, nobody moves, nobody gets hurt.
- Come on, come on.
- Shut up.
- Everybody keep their hands where I can see it.
- Down! Face down!
Dad, don't.
Alarm!
Frank K lsaac, Assistant Manager.
I have a family.
I bet you do.
Put the gun down and turn around.
I can't allow you to walk out of here.
We got ourselves a problem then, don't we?
Clave.
Shut up.
Now I'm going to count to three.
You're going to lay that pistol down onto the floor.
One.
Two.
Get back.
Now!
What the hell are you looking at? Check the front door.
Get down.
Now!
You have something to say, Sister?
Nothing you want to hear.
Keep that way.
Alright everybody up, move over here. Come on!
It's not too late to stop this.
Tell him that.
Now shut up and move!
This is Lieutenant Roll.
I want SWAT snipers deployed to all buildings across the street and surrounding the bank.
I did that, Lieutenant.
Sniper teams deployed and in position in three minutes.
Okay, get me an open line into the bank!
Get those people back!
Come on! Let's go! Move! Come on!
Everyone in!
Everybody down behind the Manager's desk. Now!
Move!
Get down!
You move, you are dead.
We want your valuables. Watches, rings, wallets, whatever you've got, give it up.
Your wallet.
Inside.
Hurry up.
That means you too, lady, come on.
He looks like he's just seen a ghost.
He has. And I intend to rattle some bones as soon as I can get to him.
How was it that this guy is still alive and I didn't know about it?
Well I guess that Daddy keeps some secrets from you.
Did he tell you about those letters?
I'm sure he didn't know about them.
Oh that would be a stretch considering I stole them from his strongbox.
I'm afraid I woke him up.
When?
Last night.
Why are you here?
Well, bad dream.
I was awake all night.
Hey, you think a man with as much to lose as your father would have a better home security system.
You are lying.
Ask him about that little gift I left for him.
Are you sure it was Jarod?
He took some of Catherine's things and some of mine and left this behind.
Jarod is rubbing our noses in it.
Whose phone is that?
Hello? Hello?
Hello? Miss Parker?
- Hello?
- Give it.
Miss Parker?
Parker?
It's Broots.
It's Broots.
Can you hear me? Hello? Hello?
Watches and wallets, come on, give it up.
Put it in the bag.
Jude.
You weren't going to shoot my little brother, were you, lady?
I'll leave the executions to you.
Throw something over him.
Out of sight, out of mind, ah?
Hey!
Leave her alone.
Alright.
Alright.
Get up.
- What?
- Get up!
What are you doing, Clavell?
Getting us out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
Two armed robbers have entered the Dover Town Bank.
We do know gunshots have been fired and hostages have been taken.
She never hung up the phone so I was able to triangulate the signal.
And called the Dover Police, they told me about the robbery.
Then I called Mr Parker's office,
but nobody's got back to me.
We need to go to Dover.
- Without a directive from upstairs? Sydney, forget it.
- Miss Parker is not just a colleague, Broots.
She is a friend.
Just a minute, a situation is developing.
One of the robbery suspects is emerging from the bank with a hostage at gunpoint.
Sydney, is that who I think it is?
I want a helicopter to the airport and I want a plane waiting on the runway!
Oh, boy.
You got one hour to set it up or people start to die!
Where is this?
Dover.
Dover Town Bank?
Round up your group.
''April 13th 2 AM. We failed to rescue Timmy.''
No!
Raines had already destroyed that sweet little boy.
Raines, what are you going to do with Timmy now?
There is no Timmy any more.
They'll call him Angelo now.
''We plan to rescue Jarod tonight and tomorrow you and I will be on our way to a better place.''
''All my love, Mum.''
Going somewhere?
Apparently not.
There is no smoking here.
Call a cop.
I need the key to the outer vault door.
Dad, give it to him.
Dad?
This your daughter, Frank?
You stay away from her.
Okay, dad.
She sure is a peach though.
Your mother should be shot for sending you here.
If you cared about me, she wouldn't have asked me to do this.
That's what she said? I don't care about you?
She is telling you lies.
Lies.
Yeah, the kind Jarod perpetuates about her, about me.
The parents lying to their children.
Now where have I heard that one before?
My father had his reasons for keeping those letters from me.
Like he had his reasons for saying that your mother's death was a suicide?
But if you really believe that why are you so hell bent on finding out what Mr Fenigor has to say?
Combo to the vault cage?
Only the senior manager has it. He's not in today.
How are you doing, sweetie?
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
Why don't I put a bullet through your brain?
I can open the vault.
What are you? Some kind of handyman?
Just versatile.
You know there's another way out of here.
One with less bloodshed, specifically yours.
What are you talking about?
There is a vent that leads down to a main sewer line.
It leads right out of here.
Then how do you know that?
I studied the blueprints before I came in here.
You're not the only one who's on the run.
So you're a handyman and a fugitive architect?
You are versatile.
Now open it.
That's very good.
Let's go.
Tell the cops to bring us something to eat, I'm starving.
You are always starving.
Get in there.
Give me a bag.
Come on.
Keep an eye on.
Mr. Fenigor.
My name is Jarod.
Do you remember me?
Should I?
I was one of the children that you and Catherine Parker tried to rescue from the Centre.
You tried to help me once.
Please.
Help me now.
I, I don't knwo what you are talking about.
You are the only person who can help me find out who my parents are.
Look you are being held against your will,
you feel trapped and you feel terrified.
I lived my entire life that way, please, help me.
You and her together?
It's complicated.
- You don't know what you're asking of me.
- I am asking you to honour Catherine Parker's memory.
Please tell me who my parents are.
Help me find out who I am.
I can't.
Please.
- I can't. I'm sorry. I just can't.
- Mr. Fenigor.
No.
No.
Hey.
I have to help him.
I didn't shoot him so he could be helped.
- Clave.
- Not now, Jude.
Hey, hey, hey!
It's one thing to defend yourself against an armed bank guard.
It's another thing to shoot an innocent man in the back.
If this man dies, so do you.
In the electric chair.
The bullet punctured his lung.
He's drawing in air from the exit wound.
- I need hand towels and I need some soap.
- In the bathroom.
Details at this time are sketchy,
however another shot was just heard from inside the bank.
I'm going to make my way to the SWAT commander now for confirmation.
Don't you die on me.
I need a plastic bag and I need some tape.
I've got a bag.
We have to seal the wound or he won't be able to breathe.
Cut off strips about this long.
Apply constant pressure to the wound like this.
- I have to get him to a hospital.
- Nobody goes anywhere!
Maybe we should do it.
It's just one guy.
Nobody goes anywhere!
Find me something to elevate his legs.
He's diaphoretic.
His pulse is thready and he's bleeding internally.
I can stabilize him for a while but we need to get him to surgery.
What the hell am I doing here?
- How does it feel to be the prey instead of the predator?
- Well you wouldn't be the prey if you get back to the Centre where you belong.
Oh, nice!
Fitting.
You are so willing to ruin my life.
Is your father's validation that important to you?
I'm standing here with Christy Isaac whose daughter Kaylee is a hostage inside the bank. Christy?
Please don't hurt my daughter.
She's all I have.
Mum.
Kaylee, Kaylee, I love you.
Frank, please take care of her.
It's difficult for little girls to figure out their fathers, isn't it?
What?
You give your loyalties to a man who fills your head with lies.
- Lies about those letters, lies about Fenigor.
- And I suppose my loyalty should go out to you.
- And what would you do if Fenigor confess that it was your father who killed your mother?
- He did't. He loved her.
You are so sure of that, aren't you, Miss Parker?
It appears to me that the police seem to be mobilising for a possible assault on the bank.
Everybody into the vault.
Let's go.
How is he doing?
He is stable, for now.
How well do you know him?
Comes in every Friday to pull cash out of his trust account.
Does he ever come in to make deposits?
His account is funded by an outside source.
Some company from Blue Cove.
So the Centre is paying Fenigor to keep quiet.
Question is who?
And quiet about what?
Over here, Broots.
Anything?
No.
Police, locals, no one I recognize.
Maybe we are the only ones who know that Jarod is here.
Think again.
It's Gar and another of Raines' guys.
They're not the only ones. That's Sam.
This place is crawling with Sweepers.
We need to figure out what Raines is up to.
I'll follow Sam.
You follow the others.
Wait, wait, wait, Sydney.
Oh God, what am I doing here?
I must be out of my mind.
What are they doing?
Working on escape plan B.
''April 13th, 7AM.''
''I have a bad feeling about the people surrounding me.''
''If I can just get through this tonight,''
''we'll be on our way to a better place.''
''All my love, Mum.''
I know it's not easy reading those letters.
Look I broke into your father's house,
trying to find something about my past,
but instead I found out about yours.
Your mother deserved a better fate than what she got.
You're damn right she did.
She used to send me letters on my birthday, holidays.
I never knew about these.
My father paid me a visit this morning.
Talking about how you taint the memory of my mother with lies.
And you believed him.
Daddy.
I have to go to the bathroom.
- Hold it.
- I cannot.
These men are crazy. I'm not going to risk getting us both killed.
Clave.
What are you doing?
Your job.
Clave.
The kid has to use the bathroom, so do I.
- Hold it.
- Hey, give us a break, huh?
Jude.
Thanks for what you did back there.
When you got to go, you got to go.
My Dad says that he wants to take care of me, but,
but then he lies to me.
Daddy.
Why are you here?
Ah, bad dream.
I was awake all night.
I don't know what to believe.
Believe what's in your heart.
Come on.
Jarod.
Mr Fenigor, you've been shot. Don't try to move.
You saved my life.
I did what was needed to be done.
Jarod.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I took you from your family.
- I do want to let you know how sorry I am.
- Mr Fenigor please.
Tell me who my parents are.
Is that the key to his safe deposit box?
- There might be something about my mother in there.
- If there is, you'll get it.
Miss Parker, I brought you this far. I'm not going to shut you out now.
Fenigor, my mother called you her friend.
You owe her. You owe the both of us the truth.
Who killed my mother?
Who killed my mother?
Miss Parker, please, he can barely breathe.
Who's paying you off to keep it a secret?
- What's happening to him?
- There must be blood around his lungs.
I need some sort of tube to drain it out.
I have a sports bottle on Daddy's desk.
Jude, Jude!
Jude, the old man can't breathe. We need the water bottle that's on the Manager's desk.
I don't know.
He's gonna die if we don't help him.
I know you couldn't do anything about that guard, but you can do something now.
Just hang on, come on.
Get back.
Don't Move!
Back off, or I drop little brother.
I've already shot two people. You think one more's gonna make a difference?
No, please. Please don't kill my father.
What's it gonna be?
Mr. Raines guy is in a SWAT uniform. He is right up there.
The target must be Jarod.
We have to take care of the sniper before he shoots Jarod.
Well, don't look at me. I can't even squash a bug, Sydney.
Then guard the alleyway.
Don't let anyone follow.
Are you up to this, Broots?
No, but it's never stopped me before.
Sydney, Mr Raines would like to see you.
You won't be needing that.
What the hell were you doing in there?
She said the old guy needed help.
Help?
I need help.
You pull something like that again, you're gonna end up just like the guard.
Brother or not.
You okay?
I wanna go home.
Me too.
Get away from her.
What?
- She tried to save us.
- You could have got us all killed.
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.
- You do as I say. I'm your father.
- Oh yeah, since when?
You know, you can keep your money.
I cannot believe Mum thought it would make a difference if I came down here.
This is because of you.
I can't figure out if you're ignorant or just stupid.
- You listen to me.
- No, you listen to me!
You think that little girl came down here today for money?
There is something here a lot more important to her than cash.
And I feel real sorry for you if you're too blind to see what that is.
Miss Parker reached out to help someone.
Spare me.
Your mother would be very proud of you.
You put on quite a show today.
Sydney taught you well.
Sydney taught me to believe that you can be anything you want to be.
You should have known better than to come here without a directive.
You should know better than to defy Tower policy by having Jarod assassinated.
You're in over your head, Sydney.
Shoot him if he tries to leave.
I've made some mistakes.
I don't want to lose you.
Mr. Fenigor?
You were my mother's friend.
Her confidant.
Please tell me who killed her.
He is not gonna tell me.
Maybe he already has.
Could you really do it, Gar?
Could you kill me if I stepped out of this car?
Yeah.
Move the car, buddy.
Thank you kindly Gar.
Now do as the officer says, move the car.
Fenigor's deposit records.
Transfer from the Centre Bank in Vinemy.
Ten thousand dollars a month.
Every month for the last twenty-eight years.
Do you recognise the account number?
- No.
- It's your father's.
How do you know?
You'd be surprised what I know about him.
That's it?
That's it.
What else does he know?
Apparently everything.
Mr Fenigor.
What secrets are in this envelope?
What is it?
It's about prodigy.
This is where you came from.
Get me out of here and I'll tell you everything.
Both of you.
What are you going to do with that dye pack egg?
Well.
Handyman was right.
There's an access entrance to the main sewer line.
We're gonna get out of here, little brother.
Come on.
This is your lucky day, people.
Thanks to Jarod's brilliant escape plan none of you will have to die today.
In spite of everything,
it's been a real gas.
Well, at least we won't starve.
Give me that one.
- What?
- Give it.
Come on, Jude.
Jude, what the hell are you doing?
Hurry up! Help me with the old man!
Be careful with him!
Out, out.
Hurry.
Mind if I cut in?
I don't like being locked up in little rooms.
This is mine.
Well, thank you, Jarod.
Let's get out of here.
The crisis is over. The hostages are coming out of the bank now and the paramedics have gone in.
Move, move, come on.
Jarod.
Mr Fenigor.
Jarod.
Mr Fenigor, why is my father paying you?
Is it about who killed my mother?
Jarod.
Answer me.
- In the red files.
- Red files?
- Prodigy red files.
- Prodigy.
Freeze.
All units, shooter second story 641 building across from the bank. Move.
Please.
You were right. Fenigor was in there.
Did we get him?
Wounded. He is in an ambulance.
I'll take care of the details.
Do you think he told her anything?
Nothing that can't be denied.
Are you alright?
Perfect.
Where is Jarod?
He got away.
Another failure.
I'm fine, daddy.
Well?
Maybe you'll sleep better tonight.
''March 20th, 1970.''
''I am counting the days until our trip to Europe.''
''How excited I am at the prospect of showing you the world.''
''For now though my friend and I must amend some of the ugliness that exists around us.''
''But I promise you and I will put all of this behind us on April 14th.''
''All my love, Mum.''
Daddy?
Am I still welcome here?
It's late.
Thank God you're alright.
I'm sorry I didn't say that earlier.
You didn't have to come all the way out here to tell me that.
Oh yes, Angel, I did.
See, I wasn't entirely forthcoming with you this morning.
Oh?
Truth is, somebody broke into my house last night.
That's terrible.
I hope you didn't lose anything valuable.
Ah, nothing that can't be replaced.
I wish I'd known earlier. I could have asked Jarod if he had anything to do with it.
Hmm, well, I wanted you to know.
Can't have secrets between family now, can we?
Daddy?
How come that Center sniper shot that old man outside the bank?
Oh, tragic accident.
Any idea who he was?
Not a clue.
Get some rest, Angel.
You sure earned it.
What?
I never had a chance to say goodbye.
How did you get away?
Escape plan B, remember?
The vent.
How was it down there?
Let's just say that I'm hoping my next pretender isn't as a sewer worker.
Did you talk to your father?
He just left.
He didn't say it was you who broke into his home, didn't say it wasn't either.
Fenigor?
I told him I didn't know who he was.
So you lied?
Like father like daughter.
Jarod, we were so close to finding the truth.
You'll figure it out.
And so will I.
The question is,
what becomes of us when we have all our answers?
That is the question.
This is where you came from.

Mr. Fenigor, tell me who killed my mother.
The answer is in the red files.

Prodigy red files.

Prodigy. This is where you came from.

''240 RTE 1''
As much as I'd like to make a sale, I have admitted it's kind of spooky.
Tell me about the fire.
A family lived here at that time. A mother, a father and a young son.
The whole story was a tragedy.
Rumour has it that boy was stolen and the parents disappeared the night the house burned.
Do you know where they went?
They were renters.
Property changed hands right after the fire.
It's now owned by a company out of Blue Cove, Delaware.
Look, I am late for work.
I'll be glad to give them a call if you'd like to make an offer.
No, thank you.
I am late for work myself.
Harvard, Med Johns Hopkins,
from a medical stand point, I'll be foolish not to hire you as head of inseminology.
Business stand point,
having a doctor named Spock on staff could be worth million bucks.
I am glad to be a part of the Nugenesis Family.
Family is what those fertility clinics all about.
You might say it's our job to make the future.
Dr. Haring, you have a moment?
There are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.
How many people died because of what I thought up?
Since I broke up, I've spent every moment searching for my past.
He is a pretender.
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.
He defends the weak and abused.
Life is a gift.

DICTATION: ±ż±ż/´Đ´Đ
You are a doctor?
I am today.
Mr. Fenigor?
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
Please tell me who killed my mother.
What did you mean by prodigy? What answers are in the red files?
Please help me.
Miss Parker.
You are not supposed to be here. No one is.
Has he talked?
He hasn't spoken since they brought him in.
An opinion around here is that he never will.
Well, we've tried in Vitro, Gift, Zift.
We've literally gone around the world trying to get pregnant.
But NuGenesis show us the only fertility clinic seems to get really care.
Always will.
NuGenesis prides himself being on the cutting edge of reproductive technology.
And I am proud to say that Jarod here, is on the cutting edge of all.
Can you help us?
Any couple with as much love to give as you two obviously have,
deserve to have a child.
Thank you.
Dr. Dewitt will be sharing duties as well.
Anything you need, they're here for you.
A patient mental attitude is sometimes more important than his or her physical condition.
If her mind has faith, her body would follow.
Oh, it's up to us to make sure our patients keep that faith, so our science can do its job.
Jeremy.
Run these and get the results back to Dr. Spock, staff.
Spock? Funny.
For over thirty years, we helped couples like the Brewster realize the fruits of parenting.
Thirty years?
Long before you were born.
I like this guy.
My brother Boris would have liked him too.
- My father.
- And as he always said,
''Get busy.''
Well, I get to go.
I'll catch up with you later.
Red files.
This is where you came from.
Any word out of Fenigor?
He's still unconscious.
You look like you need to change your pamper.
Ah, something weird is going on with Mr. Raines.
Everything going on with...
that half-burnt wheezing ghoul is weird.
No. He is packing up his office, to go.
Well, find out where.
And while you will find out what prodigy means.
Oh, well, that's easy.
Prodigy is someone extraordinary, very talented child.
I know what it means to webster's.
- I want to know what it means to the Center.
- Ok.
So you and Sydney find out everything you can about prodigy and something called ''the red files''.
Okay, I will do what I can, but Sydney's occupied.
Doing what?
String soap adds grey matter?
I am putting him through an experimental neuro-stimulation therapy,
that hopefully we'll unscramble Angelo's mind.
Good luck pulling jello brains out of ...
Let's go back to work, Angelo.
''No Admittance''
''Patient Records
Input Patient I.D.#
12-072463-01''
What are you doing?
A new blood work on the Brewster's.
I want to cross check with the raw records.
I am afraid you are not allowed in here.
Jeremy is a pitbull for protocol.
Hell, even I am not allowed back here.
Uncle Nicholas's policy.
I'm sorry.
Infertility is a sensitive personal issue.
One reason Nugenesis has been so successful is because of trust.
And confidentiality.
We don't even use patients' names.
Only code numbers.
- Jeremy will get anything you need.
- Thank you.
- Good night, Jarod.
- Good night.
Only four more treatments left, my friend.
Hope it works.
Thank you.
Sydney.
Good morning, ladies.
Got to have a special pass to go up that way.
- A pass?
- That's Corridor Seven.
You are not allowed.
I am finding there's many places I am not allowed around here.
''Mr. Raines Personal''
Oh, my god.
- Make sure all of these boxes are out of my office tonight.
- Right.
I'll meet you later.
Hello, Jarod.
My name is Sydney.
I'll be taking care of you for a while.
Why?
Where are my mum and dad?
Here is a fresh bandage.
Why?
Wherer are my mum and dad?
I'd like you to solve a problem for me.
If he starts sing ''A rain in Spain'', I am gonna pass out.
Angelo's mind is working again.
We are restoring the neuro-pathways of his memory.
You know that serotonin isotope?
It seems to regenerate dead pathways.
However, if he doesn't get the entire dosage,
he'll regress permanently.
I am impressed, Einstein.
But my gut tells me that Jarod has something to do with this.
Jarod wanted to know what could be discovered if Angelo's mind returned.
The potential is unlimited.
I believe he can even play the piano.
Music.
What's going on?
Cos then he woke up remembered he was Liberace.
Mr. Valentino played that as a child.
Information of his mind has been absorbing for a lifetime.
It's starting to re-emerge.
This is the icying on a very freaky cake.
What are you bubbling about?
I found this in Raines' office. He had twenty more in file on his desk.
The desk just accidently I hid under for over an hour.
Hiding is bad enough. But I had to watch what Raines did, you know, personal stuff.
What could have been so awful?
He changed his pants.
Oh, thanks for that.
Why is Raines packing and moving?
And why this freak had twenty photos of the same school children?
Red files.
He can't be doing it again.
- Not again.
- Angelo, easy, Angelo.
He said red files.
Then if he is getting his memory back, then he must know something about them.
If that's truth is somewhere in that demented mind, he might know who killed my mother.
Miss Parker.
You have a mail.
This is where you came from. Red files.
Rumour has it that the boy was stolenˇ­
Where are my mum and dad?
Oh, my god.
They're doing it again.
They're going to take another child.
The Center's going to make another pretender.
I thought the pretender program was discontinued years ago, Sydney.
Calm down, Jarod, calm down.
They stole me from my parents.
And they are trying to steal another child, aren't they?
Not sure. But the recent events make me feel you may be right at this.
And what are you going to this time? Are you just going to sit by and let it happen again?
Jarod, please. I think Angelo may hold some answers.
How the treatments working?
Yes.
He saw something that seemed to trigger the bad memory.
I know how he feels.
''Dr. Jarod Spock''
He is over here.
Angelo.
What's wrong with him, Syd?
Angelo needs strip his treatment dotted with specifically time intervals.
Come on, friend.
Answers below.
What is prodigy, Angelo?
Answers below.
He is pointing to the floor below us, sublevel 27.
''Inception''.
Another birthing table.
It is a delivery room.
Oh, my god.
They're recreating this place.
What?
- Oh, come on. Let's get out of here.
- Broots.
Answers here.
Find the security cameras archives that belong to this room, anything and everything.
Yes, mam.
Answers...
Syd, get Angelo his next treatment. Find out what else is in his head.
It may be the treasure chest I've been looking for.
My name is Sydney.
I'll be taking care of you for a while.
Why?
Where are my mum and dad?
If you're looking for information, the way you're going about that you gonna get caught.
If you want help, I'll help you.
Why should I trust you?
Because your mother did.
I polished floors in this place for over thirty years.
I've seen a lot of people come and go.
The hearts in the hands, filled with love they want to share with the child.
Your parents were like that.
How did you know them?
They were here over six months trying for a baby.
Your mother treated me with respect.
I saw her a year so later.
I'll never forget the gleam she had in her eyes when she showed me her baby boy.
The same gleam that's in yours.
That's what hurt so much.
Hurt?
I saw them a few years later.
She was scared, on the run.
Somebody had stolen the boy.
My guess is that was you.
I've been searching for them.
Part of your pain is because of me.
See I told Dr. Boris what she said.
There was a lot of weird stuff going on in Corridor Seven backed in, with kids.
Testing and stuff.
Dr. Boris paid me to forget about it.
The weird stuff stopped.
Dr. Boris died and everything ran away.
Until what?
A while back to start up again.
Kids, testing, and then you showed up.
Do you recognize any of these children?
It's a local elementary school.
One of these children is going to be taken, just like I was.
I may need your help to stop it.
I owe you that much.
And your mother.
Thank you.
There is no Timmy.
From now on, his name be Angelo.
He is remembering what Raines told my mother after he fried his brain.
- I am afraid he is remembering too quickly.
- Well, cut his dosages or something.
I don't want him to pop before he can answer my questions.
Can't be done.
The treatment is giving this specifically time stages that can't be interrupted.
Any break in the schedule means the new pathways and the system will atrophy.
And if they do?
Angelo will regress to his previous self.
Permanently.
- Angelo.
- There is no more Timmy.
From now on, he should be known as Angelo.
Get me Mr. Raines.
I stored Dr. Boris's stuff down here, Jarod.
If you get red files anywhere, there is only one place it would be.
You ain't a safe cracker, are you?
Maybe today,
I don't have to be.
You find something?
Yes.
Me.
And the red files.
What is saying there about you?
It's personal... Blood type, blood scans, height, weight, it's all medical.
Except for one thing.
Destination.
Destination?
It's blacked out.
I'd like you to solve a problem for me.
I was here.
Pi times square root of 931 divided by the radius of the circle.
Very good, Jarod. You are very special.
Where are my mum and dad?
You won't believe what I've found.
What?
Security videos logs in the mainframe,
that correspond to the inception room.
And?
A visual record classified under Catherine Parker.
What?
It's the day you were born.
Keep pushing.
Miss Parker, it's your birth.
This is too weird.
Oh, well, it's just beginning.
Here comes, here comes.
- Is that...
- The Saint Dr. Raines.
Raines delivered me?
Specks your bottom in a second.
I am going to puke.
It's a girl.
I can't believe he saw me nude.
Okay, Catherine, the next one is coming. It's coming quick.
Next one?
Sydney, what's going on?
It appears you didn't arrive alone.
There is a trouble with the boy. Nurse.
Syd.
What's wrong with him?
Tell me what's wrong with him?
What else is on that?
The tape ends there. It cut off, or edited...
Or erased.
So no one would find out the truth.
I had a brother.
I feel like I found a treasure chest,
and inside it's only dust.
Well, sometimes answers lead to more questions.
But for what it's worth, I do remember what your parents first names were.
Margaret and Charles.
Yeah.
Which it still not to say they are your biological parents.
What do you mean?
Back in those days, this was also a adoption agency not just a reproduction center.
Dr. Boris headed up the adoptions.
Dr. Nicholas ran conceptions.
Another dead end.
Maybe not.
''Oakview 555-6507''
The old Oakview Lodge, near Stone Mountain.
Your parents used to stay there when they were here.
Could be a treasure, could be dust.
Yes, just let me know when this's done, will you? I don't want any excuses. That...
Angel.
That thing has a stop button?
Oh, yeah.
Endows me my private pride,
you do look exquisite sitting there.
Some day you will, permanently.
Parents always want what's best for their children, and...
- Of course, you look...
- How dare you?
What?
Why didn't you tell me I had a twin?
Your mother and I,
wanted to spare you unnecessary pain.
I was away when you both were born.
He died before he ever lived.
We buried him.
But not too pain.
Pain or not, I have the right to know, I had a brother.
- Angel...
- No, daddy.
Parents make mistakes too.
He is in a small plot here on the Center grounds.
- Buried at 66. I can take you there.
- No.
I'd, I'd rather find him myself.
You take one more step, I'm gonna blow your head off.
I will settle for ''no vacancy'' sign.
I'm so sorry.
It's just a awake head scared of burglary around here lately.
Well, with the hour I know, I just didn't think anybody's gonna be checking in.
Are you the owner?
Yeah.
Lewis King Road. And keep it to the stars.
Well, you can name your pleasure.
I got mountain view, lake view.
I even got one room my old man used to tell people Jeff Davies slept in.
Did you grow up here?
I grew old, never up.
Lewis.
Do you recognize this woman?
Oh, my Lord.
You must be baby Jarod.
I'll never forget the winter I met your parents.
You know that the lake view I mentioned.
Well, I think float's over.
And I went out on it,
broke through.
Your dad rushed in and saved my life.
What is it?
That's funny. You don't look like either one of your folks.
This cottage right here was theirs. Let's go and take a look.
Oh, here, this's it.
The light's working.
Well, it's, it's not much.
But your dad loved the view.
Major Charles.
That's what I called your dad on the kind of Air Force uniform.
Air Force.
Yeah, he's a pilot.
He and your mummy used to sit out on this porch.
Watched sun rise in the morning.
They really loved each other.
- Lewis.
- Yeah.
I would like to stay here for a little while if you don't mind.
Make yourself at home.
You're sort of a family,
''In finding Timmy, you set Angelo free.
Thank you, Sydney''
Good morning, class. My name is Jarod...
My name is Mr. Kotter.
And I will be your substitute teach for Miss Markam today.
Well, the first of all business,
is we'll divide up to small groups and we will...
Ah, yes, Ari.
We always start with Pledge of Allegiance.
Yes, I've heard of that.
Why don't you to lead us off today?
I pledge our allegiance to the flag,
of the United States of America,
and to the Republic for which it stands,
one Nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
That's it?
That's it.
Okay.
Now we are going to divide up into groups.
As I call your name, please move to the table I assign you.
Table number one: Albert Williams
Ari Thompson
and Davy Simpkins.
Table two...
Tyrannosaurus Rex? Very good.
I would like you to solve this problem for me.
Can we just cut out dinosaurs like the other kids?
Class, work quietly for a moment.
I'll be right back.
Where is Angelo?
He has escaped from the Center.
''In finding Timmy, you set Angelo free.
Thank you, Sydney''
That's, that's beautiful.
Isn't it?
I hope you're proud of yourself, Syd.
Great.
While Algernon is out there picking flowers,
And you two ponder your navels, I am left with buckets.
And you just wait till Raines finds out.
- Does Angelo have to take the serum?
- I hope so.
He has three treatments left.
He misses one, and he'll regress to all the Angelo.
Permanently.
And what he knows will be lost forever.
Thank you, daddy.
Bye.
Pi times the square root of 931 divided by the radius of the circle.
Which one of you did this?
- You did.
- You're lying.
Seven red files.
These were just found by a sweeper team in Angelo's space.
Angelo?
We're still searching.
You know the ramifications if this information's ever got out.
I want your blessing to accelerate prodigy,
to ensure its success.
Get the new one now.
Go, bring us the child.
Who is?
Angelo.
Angelo.
I got here as quick as I could.
It is so good to see you.
The real you.
It's good to be me.
Thank you, Jarod.
It's a big world out here.
My parents stayed in this room a long time ago.
Now I feel it's like it's me I am searching for.
I wonder if I ever know my parents.
You are in the red files too.
There are answers, Angelo.
You're just out to find them.
This is Timmy now.
What is it?
I heard that your brother died.
Feel sad to know that.
Yes, it does.
It feels...
It feels sad.
These blocks, they were used by the child that the Center wants.
If you could just feel something that would tell us who it is.
Timmy feels nothing.
No.
Angelo did.
Time for my treatment.
You are a very special little boy, Jarod.
- Red files.
- Red files?
Red files.
Prodigy.
This is where you came from.
We are all special.
Because of what's in our blood.
Three color-coded samples as requested.
Albert Williams, Ari Thompson, Davy Simpkins.
All three have blood samples on file.
How did you get pass Jeremy?
Nothing as invisible as a man with a mop.
What are you going to do with them?
Throw on waters.
Wait until the sharks come.
I am sorry.
I don't know how much more disappointment she can take.
How are you holding up?
The first time we started talking about adoption.
The process takes forever.
We just want a chance to raise a child.
I am sure you'll get that chance.
Morning, Jarod.
Good morning, Dr. Haring.
I think Mrs. Brewster aren't pregnant?
No, not yet.
Although I have found three excellent egg donor candidates.
- Those have been analyzed, did you?
- Not yet.
But considering Mrs. Brewster's current cycle, I'd like to get on it right away.
Jeremy.
I want a complete work up on these immediately.
So it shall be right now, so it shall be done.
Let's hope we'll find what we are looking for.
Yes.
Let's.
Dr. Dewitt, there is something you should see.
Tell me you found Angelo.
No, but I found something else.
I think maybe Sydney should show it to you.
- I just take a little break.
- Broots.
Last time I saw that little Bambi's mother was in my cross hairs.
Well, I've been hitting dead ends on this birthing things,
so this morning I helped myself to Raines's moving boxes
where I found some personal surveillance files.
Twice in three days?
Broots found something you need to see, Miss Parker.
Sit down.
I'll stand.
Uh, it's more of your birthing record.
What's wrong with him?
I'm sorry, Catherine. The second child is stillborn.
Standard post-natal procedure for the baby girl and sedation for Catherine in the recovery.
Yes, doctor.
Oh, my god.
He was alive.
The male baby is ready for transportation to Nugenesis.
What's Nugenesis?
Yes.
I have a brother,
out there.
Jarod.
Is something wrong?
I found these in lab of on the doners' three blood samples.
I need to contact one of them right away.
Did you find a perfect donor?
Well, unfortunately not for the Brewsters.
But it is perfect match for a special project I am heading up.
Dr. Haring doesn't know, right?
Anyway, the sooner you can get me the contact number on this subject, the better.
I'll do my best.
Thanks.
Davy Simpkins.
Is this Davy's house?
Well, it's the right address anyway.
Hello, I am sorry to bother you.
My name is Jarod Spock. And I am looking for Davy Simpkins.
You just missed him.
- He doesn't live here?
- He did.
We are Davy's foster parents.
Oh, we were. They found him a permanent home.
He just left.
- They?
- The man from child placement.
Davy called him the Snowman.
Snowman?
Because of his hair.
It is solid white.
Raines's cleaner, Gar.
Is something wrong?
Did he tell you where he was taking Davy?
I assume to the county airstrip.

Previously on the pretender:
I am glad to be part of the Nugenesis family.
Family is all those fertility clinics all about.
If you want help, I'll help you.
- Why should I trust you?
- Because you mother did.
What did you mean by Prodigy? What answers are in the red files?
It's working, Parker.
Angelo's mind is working again.
Why didn't you tell me I had a twin?
We buried him, but not to pain.
He was alive.
I have a brother.
He can't be doing it again.
They're going to take another child.
The Center's going to make another pretender.
There are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.
How many people died because of what I thought up?
Since I broke up, I've spent every moment searching for my past.
He is a pretender.
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.
He defends the weak and abused.
Life is a gift.

DICTATION: ±ż±ż/´Đ´Đ
You are a doctor?
I am today.
Where is he?
Who?
The child.
Prodigy.
They must have set up a relay.
A safehouse before the boy arrives here.
I am not going to lose him, Sydney.
What are you going to do?
I have doors on my own to open.
How are you, angel?
Sweetheart?
Tell me about my brother.
- I thought we already dealt with that.
- He didn't die at birth.
What were you saying? Why are you doing this?
What's wrong with him? Tell me what's wrong with him?
Sorry, Catherine, the second child is stillborn.
The male baby is ready for transportation to Nugenesis.
Daddy?
You didn't know about this?
How can you even ask me that?
Raines.
I'll take care of this.
Are you alright?
I will be when we find my brother.
In a way,
it's a gift.
Gift?
I have a son.
Sun feels good.
Warm.
Free.
When I first escaped the Center,
I used to take a long walk in the sunshine.
I couldn't breath deep enough to feel my lungs.
I remember, when I was small,
before they locked me away under the world,
I remember,
- What do you remember?
- Music.
Angelo.
Do you remember anything about where you were taken before they locked you under the world?
I can't remember.
Time for medicine.
Two more treatments.
Maybe this will help you remember.
We have to remember.
For the boy.
For the boy.
Nothing on the mainframe about a safehouse.
- Fenigor's red files.
- All seven.
I found them in my father's office.
You stole those from Mr. Parker?
Is that a problem?
Not for you.
Fenigor said the answers are in these files.
That does ignite by code numbers only.
Do you think one of these files could have something to do with Jarod?
What are you getting at?
No one knows how old Jarod is.
And if your twin was taken to Nugenesis,
do you think maybe Jarod could be your brother?
The answer is in Nugenesis.
I want to see the boy.
He is upstairs sleeping. You can see him on the monitor.
Neuro-pathway stimulation in progress.
And progressing smoothly.
Should we get him back to the Center?
He can't be moved yet.
This treatment is predicated on a straight timetable.
By morning he will be ready for transport.
Where am I?
The ten digit number is under the expediter. They're the same of all seven files.
Try running ... ID number.
Oh, man.
What is it?
You were right, Syd.
The number is identification code for the expediter who brought the children to the Center.
And?
And you will not gonna believe who it is.
Fenigor?
Fenigor?
Fenigor, wake up, man.
I need to know about Prodigy.
Red files.
The children.
Catherine, we could not save them.
I have to know where the children were taken before being brought to SL27.
Charleston.
Charleston, South Carolina.
Blue box inception.
Inception, that's the room in SL27.
Are there more computer files there?
Answer, red files.
Eighth file.
Eighth file?
Sydney, there is only supposed to be seven files.
It's beautiful.
People where I grew up play that,
when I was little.
I need you to remember when you were taken.
I know it's hard.
There is a little boy out there in danger.
Like I was?
Just like you.
They were men.
Where did they take you?
A house.
A glass house.
Tell me about this house.
Big.
Dark.
What else do you see?
A statue.
What kind of statue?
A lady.
An angel.
- The sign said: Angel Manor.
- Angel Manor?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yes.
Charleston, South Carolina. All I know.
Thank you,Sydney.
The first treatment is almost done.
What exactly are you doing with the boy?
Helping to prepare for his future.
As what?
The pretender has the bloodline show the gift.
I am helping to focus his potential.
Like you did to Angelo?
Angelo was a mistake. Trial and error.
With the new technology I'll be able to focus the neuro stimulation to the parts of his brain I want to hyper develop.
Is that what you did to create Jarod?
No, Jarod was a natural pretender.
I'm merely trying to recreate him.
What was that? Willie.
- Where is it?
- Over there.
Angelo crawled into the storm drain.
Get the generator on now.
Mr. Raines, power is out.
Get back to the boy now.
Jarod.
How is he?
They hurt him like they did me.
Like they did me.
Tell me how long he has.
Basically motor skills has diminished and he's been unresponsive to external stimuli for hours.
What did you see at the Angel Manor?
Neuro-receptors.
That's the very same process Raines used on Angelo.
Well, there is one ray of hope.
Angelo's treatment seems to work.
Is he with you?
Yes. And I'm hoping the same treatment can be used on Davy.
It could.
But Raines's new process would be much harder to reverse,
if possible ...
The brain is a non-forgiving area, Jarod.
Time is against you.
So you're saying that if we don't counteract Raines's treatment,
Davy's degeneration could be irreversible.
It will be.
You have three hours or less to synthesize the new serum.
I won't let him do it again.
Jarod, there is something else you should know.
It's about you, you and Miss Parker.
''Inception''
You think it's true that Jarod is Miss Parker's brother?
If Fenigor is right, the answer is under here.
Well, maybe we would find blue box in the junk somewhere.
Hello, nurse.
Here it is, Syd.
I got it. You know this is one blue ex cube I don't know if I want to solve.
Maybe if I don't decrypt the information on it,
I might even be able to sleep in nights.
Syd.
I found it.
''Records Lab''
How much longer?
Ten minutes.
- Thank you for getting me in here.
- Save it until I get you out.
I know you can hear me.
I've been where you are, Davy.
I've been you.
Jarod is going to make everything alright.
Jarod's gonna make it alright.
You are sure that stuff's gonna help that boy?
If he gets it in time.
I can't believe that all these happened again.
This isn't your fault.
But you were, Jarod.
And all these years, I've been asking God for forgiveness.
Well, I don't know about God's. But you have mine.
''Dr. Jarod Spock''
''Oakview 555-6507''
Hello, Oakview Lodge.
It's clear. Come on.
Thank you for giving me a little piece of my past.
And thank you for giving me a peace of mind.
Good luck.
Where is the boy?
He's safe.
Unlike you.
Sorry.
Get up.
Let him go.
Go, Jarod.
You have no idea what you're getting yourself into.
This is my chance to make it right.
Go.
For the boy.
No.
Damn it.
Oh, man.
All seven red files, plus the eighth, just like Fenigor said.
Does it say if they are brother and sister?
Oh, you are not gonna believe what it says.
Angelo.
Angelo.
I've got it.
It's not the kid you need to worry about.
Well, it's good to see you again.
Sis.
How do you know I have a brother?
You've got the red files too?
Mr. Fenigor was right about Prodigy.
Our bloodlines and the lies the Center fed us.
- What are you saying that you're my ...
- There were eight red files.
Eight?
Each of these files represents one of the children the Center isolated as a potential pretender.
There were seven children that your mother tried to save.
But the secret to your past,
is in the 8th file.
The 8th child.
You got my attention.
Nugenesis monitored these eight children for the Center.
They screened them.
You see there is a special anomaly in our blood,
in our genetics.
They predisposes us with a gift.
What is the big secret of number eight?
Number eight,
it's you.
My blood was tested?
Yours and your ... twin brother who supposedly died at birth.
Instead he was wasted off to Nugenesis.
I've narrowed your brother's identity down to these two files.
One of these belong to you?
No.
I am not your brother.
But one of these files does belong to him.
Him?
And the other two of the boy named Bobby.
But you know him better as,
Mr. Lyle.
So you are telling me,
that my brother is either a psychotic killer or a mush head.
It's unmistakable.
I need a drink.
Big one.
That him?
His name is Davy.
Raines's new pretender.
As you can see, Raines already has a jump on it.
Now Davy's only hopeful recovery is an injection of serotonin.
And if I don't give it to him now, his condition becomes irreversible.
No one's doing anything until I figure out what the hell is going on.
If you want to shoot me, then go ahead and do it.
False bravado.
Never cared for that in a man.
Help us!
Your mum,
may be my mum.
died trying to save children like Davy.
Do it for her.
Do it.
I heard shots. Are you alright?
Oh, god.
What can we do?
Nothing.
It's over.
No, it's not.
Angelo.
That's your last treatment.
- Without it youˇ­
- He is a boy.
Let him be a boy.
Please.
Sydney.
This is more than I can take.
Stolen kids, stillborn babies that aren't, Miss Parker's brother.
Re-activating SL27.
It is my fault.
I should have stopped this years ago.
Come on, Sydney, what could you've done?
I could have tried.
Catherine Parker tried.
Fenigor tried.
She is dead and he soon will be.
Now deader than I'll feel inside if I don't try out.
What? Syd, I mean what could you possibly do?
Syd, Syd.
Wait a minute.
That lady with the legs, she's threw a wicked right hook.
It's difficult to distinguish between her bite and her bark.
I read it so. Look at this.
I found this dash away in my parents belongings.
It's a young one of you.
I remember your dad taking it.
It's on the morning just like today.
Do you know if I was their child?
or if I was adopted?
No.
I just know they loved you.
Very much.
Where am I?
You are safe.
Are you the substitute teacher?
Yeah.
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.
And you are going to be home.
Soon.
I like this song.
Me too.
Is it possible?
Maybe.
I wish I could've known you, the real you.
I wish I could've known the real you.
Mum loved that song.
She played it for me.
Tell me about her.
Well.
They say she looked,
Just like you.
Yeah.
Her smile made me feel safe.
Her compassion,
I can only dream of duplicating.
She loved to read to me,
take long walks with me.
She loved me.
And I loved her.
I miss her everyday.
You see her everyday.
I know, you don't have much time, but,
do you remember something,
anything that could tell me who killed her?
Who killed mum?
I know it's there.
Somewhere.
I saw, I,
I,
watched.
A man.
What man?
What man?
Leave me alone.
A man in a dark suit.
Who?
I don't know.
Fenigor knows.
Yes.
But I hope you did too.
She played it for you.
I play it for you.
That was beautiful.
''Danger Explosives''
I want a twenty-four-hour lockdown on all personnel
for security checks and final test runs.
No one in or out. Is that clear?
Raines.
This is Gar. I am in Nugenesis.
I know where they are.
And, who is with them.
Then work back in business.
In twelve hours, I'm putting you out of business.
He is okay to travel now.
We have to move.
I can't let you leave, Jarod, you know that.
Is this what your mother would've done?
It's time to go home.
Where are you taking me?
It doesn't have to be this way.
New blood for the Center, your mother would be so proud of you.
Save it.
I saw your face when Angelo gave up his last treatment for Davy.
Let's go.
Angelo.
Are you alright?
What's wrong with him?
Off me.
Jarod.
Jarod.
Save Davy.
Angelo.
Guess your gun jammed, huh?
Davy free.
Miss Parker's still in hell.
We can't accept this.
Mr. Brewster, creating a whole new life doesn't come cheap.
Believe me. That's you cover everything at Davy, you,
your new family's going to ever need.
If you don't want to do this, I understand.
If what you've told us is true,
Davy is gonna need all the love we can get.
Is that your family?
It will be.
Some day.
His regression is complete.
And irreversible.
I am sorry.
Will he remember anything?
Well, he'll remember all that's important.
Where are you going?
Unfinished business.
Mr. Fenigor.
Mr. Fenigor.
Catherine.
No.
I am her daughter.
My mother isn't here.
She is.
In spirit.
How did you get back into the Center?
The same way I am going to get out.
If you get out, why did you come?
I want to know who I am.
And I'd rather die trying to find out than live not knowing.
He is sleeping in and out.
My parents.
- Tell me about my parents.
- Who killed my mother?
A man in a dark suit.
A man in a dark suit.
Who is the man in a dark suit?
The man who killed your mother.
Who is he?
Jarod's father.
Jarod.
What's that, Broots?
It's security alarm.
It's in SL27.
SL27?
It would be no one down there.
Well, the surveillance camera says there is.
It's Jarod.
- Mr. Raines, securities just reported a breach in SL27.
- What kind of breach?
Well, according to surveillance, it's Jarod.
Jarod is back.
Jarod.
It's like another dead end.
I know all I need to know.
Do you?
Have all the deceit, and all the betrayal we both experienced, how do you know what the truth is?
Fenigor had no reason to lie.
Then you're going to have to shoot me, because I am going to find out the truth.
But we want you alive, Jarod.
I...., angel.
Jarod.
Jarod, get out. There is a bomb.
Forgive me.

<i>Only you...</i>
could have created a mess
big enough to put me back in the field.
I am thrilled to be
working with you as well.
<i>Hmm.</i>
<i>Not for long.</i>
We've tagged Jarod's
account in Anchorage.
He uses an A.T.M. anywhere,
and he's ours.
Don't underestimate him. If we're to
catch him, we'll need to be patient.
Look, Syd, you may be satisfied
in your laboratory...
probing small minds
to solve big problems.
But I have career goals that don't
include schlepping across country...
chasing after Boy Wonder.
You were such a happy little girl.
What happened to you?
- [Beeping]
- I grew up, Sydney.
- [Buzz]
- So should you.
This is a waste of energy.
I've been through Jarod's room
a thousand times.
I haven't.
- What are you hoping to find?
- He left a bread crumb on the tanker.
And I'll bet he left one here.
Run the sim.
This is Jarod's last project.
When the black box on this flight
wasn't recovered...
he simulated the final moments
of the crash.
Using his innate Pretender skills...
Jarod effectively became
each member of the cockpit crew...
and pinpointed the cause of the crash
for our client.
Hmm.
Hell of an environment
you keep him in, Syd.
And with input like this,
maybe we'll find him...
masquerading as a postal worker.
He doesn't masquerade.
He's a Pretender.
- Hmm.
- He becomes anything he wants to be.
Well, the Centre should have stuck
to computers for their simulations.
- They don't run away.
- But they're not human.
They can't tell you how the crew
was feeling as the aircraft lost power...
how their emotions
contributed to their fate.
<i>Jarod can.</i>
Very, very clever.
- Do you know what this is?
- An origami angel.
But I haven't figured out
the emotional connection to him yet.
It's not an angel.
Its wings are bent. It's Onisius.
The Greek god of retribution.
He defends the weak and abused.
I'm impressed. How come you know
so much about Greek lore?
Oh, I did a lot of frat boys in college.
Here's your bread crumb, Sydney.
Your sociopath thinks
he is some kind of vigilante...
getting even for the little guy.
<i>St. Andrew's Middle School, Queens.</i>
<i>[Ice Cream Truck]</i>
- It tastes better before it melts.
- Oh. Right.
This is good!
This is really very good!
Do they whip air into it
to fluff it up?
I don't make it, pal.
I just serve it.

<i>[Loud Whistle]</i>
Hey!
Uh, we got us
a little situation here.
Uh, the A.T.M. says that your bank account
in Alaska has been frozen.
- No pun.
- [Chuckling]
Now, maybe you're happy,
but I'm out a Benjy for my efforts.
Did you do what I asked?
My friend,
it was an Oscar-winning performance.
Thank you.
You're giving me a C-note
for finding out you're broke?
We had an agreement.
Hey, whatever sends you.
Say, you know where to find me
if you need me, huh?
<i>[Knock On Door]</i>
Just a second.
Come in.
Good morning, Dr. Russell.
<i>Sorry to bother you,</i>
<i>but could you go talk to the Greek lady?</i>
<i>She yells at everyone that goes to her room.</i>
<i>No one understands what she's saying.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>I'll be right there.</i>
Nicole, do me a favor.
Have the lab run a complete
diagnostic testing on this.
And put a rush on it?
- Sure.
- <i>Thank you.</i>
<i>[Door Closes]</i>
[Speaking Greek]
You a doctor?
I am today.
You speak English.
When I feel like it.
And I don't need no operation.
- Hey!
- This hurts, doesn't it?
Hell yes!
I haven't gone for weeks.
Well, you need to relax.
<i>How can I relax</i>
<i>with all these tests?</i>
And now they want to cut me open.
Okay. If you don't want surgery,
I'll cancel it.
- No surgery?
- <i>No.</i>
I'm gonna try something else.
You're no doctor.
<i>You are human being.</i>
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
Sandy, make my day.
Well, we have an A.T.M. hit
on Jarod's Anchorage account.
Some genius.
Satellite feed should be up in...
two seconds.
He's in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Call the hangar
and get the jet ready.
- Hold it. He's not in Santa Fe.
He's in Rome. No, Luxembourg.
- Chicago, New York.
The little S.O.B.
scrambled the A.T.M. system.
Miami, Philadelphia, Barcelona.
Hello, Jarod.
- <i>[Gwen] You canceled Mrs. Nikkos's surgery?</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Yes, I did.</i>
<i>Fine. You're the doctor. As long</i>
<i>as I don't get blamed for anything.</i>
And I would like to try her on an herb tea
called Cassia Senna.
Doctor, this is Queens.
We don't do tea.
We do now. And I'd like
the key to Radiology, please.
Well, Andy's out to lunch, but...
- I know.
- There you are.
Thank you.
- Hi!
- Hi, Mama!
How you doin', little sugar baby?
<i>Ooh.! There he is.! There he is.!</i>
<i>Bring Mommy lunch today?</i>
<i>Ooh.! There he is.! There he is.!</i>
<i>Bring Mommy lunch today?</i>
Guess what it is.
<i>[Gwen]</i>
<i>I'm hoping for tuna fish or peanut butter.</i>
I could use a hand with these.
That is, if you have one free.
- Oh, God. It's Dr. Russell.
- <i>[Andy] Dr. Russell?</i>
I'm new.
I'm, uh, embarrassed.
But, um, always, uh...
always happy to help, Doc.
[Clears Throat]
Uh, now...
Uh, I don't understand.
Kevin Bailey is Dr. Trader's patient.
Any special reason
you're looking at these?
<i>Any special reason</i>
<i>that you're in here half naked?</i>
I can be forgetful if you can.
All right.
Your problem is right here...
at the T-eighth.
The eighth thoracic vertebrae was crushed,
severing his spinal cord.
- Kid never had a chance.
- That I understand. But look here.
This is the pre-op,
and this is the post-op X-ray.
- Yeah.
- But both of them are identical.
- How is that possible?
- It's not.
Someone must have made
a duplicate of the post-op X-ray.
<i>You see that fogging</i>
<i>in the corner there?</i>
The old processor
we keep in the basement does that.
I spilled some soda on it
when I first started working here.
The new processor's fog-free.
<i>Why would someone make a copy of</i>
<i>a post-op X-ray and label it pre-op?</i>
Makes you wonder.
[Young Jarod]
I'm on the last flight of stairs...
terrified of what I'm about to do.
My heart's pounding.
My hands are sweating.
<i>I can hardly hold on to the package</i>
<i>I told everyone was curtain rods.</i>
Sydney, is it possible for kids
to forget their parents?
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Keep your mind focused, Jarod.</i>
<i>Concentrate on the simulation.</i>
As I near the window...
I can hear the sounds
of the crowd rising from below.
[Young Jarod]
I can see them coming.
- How fast are they going?
- Forty miles per hour. You know that.
My mouth's dry.
My hands are shaking.
I raise the Mannlicher carbine.
I can't fire enough shots
before the car goes under the overpass.
I can't.
I can't do this alone.
He wasn't alone.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>He had to have had help.</i>
Trader wasn't alone either, Sydney.
[Exhales]
[Grunts, Laughs]
[Gasps]
Good one.
[Exhales]
Good game.
[Panting]
Don't let it bother you.
He never lets anyone win.
- [Jarod Laughs]
- At leastJarod's competitive.
- He's young.
- And you're lazy.
- Yeah, well, there is that.
- [Both Laughing]
Calsix.
You have a heart problem?
<i>Miles is a type-A time bomb.</i>
Two heart attacks.
One more, and it's bypass time.
Which is why I play racquetball.
And I need a refill.
So do I. Um...
<i>It's my day off.</i>
You exercise your way,
I'll exercise mine. [Chuckles]
- <i>So, Jarod, does Queen of Angels</i>
<i>get a passing grade?</i>
- <i>Absolutely.</i>
<i>Frankly, I expected there to be</i>
<i>more fallout from the malpractice problems.</i>
<i>Well, unfortunately,</i>
<i>that's the cost of doing business.</i>
We've had our difficulties, but I would put Queen
of Angels' record up against any hospital.
<i>Are you sure there's no hidden land mines,</i>
<i>even with the Kevin Bailey case?</i>
<i>Well, that was a tragedy,</i>
<i>but let's face it</i>...
an orphaned boy in a wheelchair
make for sensational headlines.
It was a damned witch hunt.
<i>Yes. Once the frenzy died down,</i>
<i>the truth took over, and we were exonerated.</i>
That is all behind us now.
<i>[School Bell Rings]</i>
<i>[Shouting, Chattering]</i>
- Get serious.
- It's good.
Hasn't anyone ever told you? You talk
to strangers, you end up on milk cartons.
My name's Jarod.
It tastes better before it melts.
Your hands still cramp up
when you wheel?
What would you know about it?
I have a good imagination.
<i>[Kids Screaming,</i>
<i>Shouting, Chattering]</i>
[Sighs]
It's gonna get better.
<i>[Car Horn Honks]</i>
I promise.
<i>[Woman] Sir, there's a Shreve Harmon</i>
<i>calling on line seven.</i>
Shreve <i>and</i> Harmon built
the Empire State Building.
Put him through
and trace the call.
[Buzz]
[Chuckling]
Very clever, Jarod.
Are you all right?
I'm broke.
You froze my bank account.
I must have just missed you
in Cincinnati.
The flowers were still fresh.
Well, my parents have been dead for 30 years.
I figured it was time I said good-bye.
- I want you to come home.
- [Chuckles]
There's an interesting way
to put it..."home."
- Why did you leave?
- You're the shrink, Sydney.
You want the truth?
It's because of the lies.
Your lies.
What lies?
I found out the real application
of my simulations, Sydney.
South Pacific
fleet simulation 118.
You took my results
and blew a ship out of the water.
A hundred and 33 people
were on board.
My outbreak simulation?
You used it in the field.
Forty-six people died
of the Ebola virus, Sydney.
Simulation 27.
Simulation 16. Simulation 42.
Jarod, these were
military contracts.
I had no way of finding out
about their ultimate application.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
You need to come home.
I'm worried about you.
I've been walking around your room,
and it feels... empty.
Well, I can't say I miss it.
And by the way...
ice cream <i>is</i> good.
Jarod, this is getting serious.
- They brought in Miss Parker.
- Uh-oh.
Well, you better
watch your back too, Sydney.
- What are you doing, Jarod?
- Using the skills you taught me.
<i>[Man] I'm completely locked out here.</i>
<i>I got nothin'.</i>
- <i>Are you getting anything?</i>
- <i>No. Let me try a new access code.</i>
- Talk to me.
- We've been locked out.
Our client hired us to see if the stock exchange
was vulnerable to manipulation.
- Jarod spent four months on this simulation.
- What's the problem?
The client gave us five million
to testJarod's results.
<i>Jarod knew today</i>
<i>was the day of the test.</i>
<i>Everything was going to plan until someone</i>
<i>on the floor started to manipulate markets.</i>
- <i>They've stolen our five million.</i>
- Gee.
I wonder who that could be.
Well, at least we know where he is.
[Laughing]
That's some kind medicine
you got there.
I might laugh myself dead
before I poop!
[Chuckling]
Laughter is very good medicine.
And so is reflexology.
Nicole, massage these marks,
would you, please?
Thanks.
You gonna tell me the truth?
What truth?
A man who gives me the sun...
who massages my feet...
who gives me stinky tea...
Who are you?
Oh, so much sadness.
And so much joy.
<i>[Miss Parker] Comforting to know</i>
<i>there are only 137 hospitals...</i>
in the metropolitan New York area.
Your rooms have been prepaid,
Miss Parker.
- Prepaid?
- In cash.
And the gentleman left this.
Not a word.
- Alan. Hey.
- Jarod, hi. Hi.
Denise, I'll have
another ginger ale, please.
- Make that two ginger ales.
- Okay.
Either you've
just been mugged...
or it's been one hell of a shift.
Four gunshot wounds,
a lobectomy and a ruptured spleen...
and I'm only halfway through.
Alan, I think I might have
screwed up today.
Really screwed up.
Hey, how you doin'?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Hey, look, is this Trader's exchange?
Good. Look, I gotta
get a message to him. Yeah.
So...
what's the trouble?
The lobectomy? I think I left
a hemo inside when I sewed her up.
- No problem.
- No problem?
- You think that's gonna make the H.M.O. happy?
- Check her chart.
If the white count is spiked,
you've found your hemo.
Well, then what?
Take it out.
Tell her you found
some internal bleeding.
- Hey, you're the doctor.
- Oh.
- <i>[Pager Beeping]</i>
- Ah.
Always count on it happening
on your lunch break, huh?
Um, I gotta get back.
- Well, thank you for the advice, Alan.
- <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>[Typing On Keyboard]</i>
<i>[Knock On Door]</i>
- [Beeps]
- Come in.
Oh, good.

- Sure.
<i>[Door Closes]</i>
This one's been with us
for only 36 hours...
and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
Hey! I'm finished!
Hi, Jarod. I'm Sydney.
- I'll be taking care of you for a while.
- Why?
Where's my mom and dad?
- <i>Where's my mom and da</i>...
- <i>[Clicks Off]</i>
[Horn Blasting]
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Please evacuate the building.</i>
- <i>[Alarm Blaring]</i>

Thank you.
- Sydney. Downstairs.
- Please make your way to the emergency exits.
- This way.
- <i>[Woman] Wait up for me.</i>
- <i>[Alarm Continues Blaring]</i>
- Just one minute, sir.
<i>[Female Voice] Please exit your room</i>
<i>and proceed to the nearest stairway exit.</i>
My God.
Sorry to wake you, Sydney...
but I needed
to speak to you face-to-face.
You look well.
What's this?
Instructions for retrieving
the Centre's five million.
- Less my commission.
- [Chuckles]
Don't look so surprised.
I don't want money. I want the truth.
What are you talking about?
Who am I?
Did the Centre adopt me?
Was I bought, or was I stolen?
And where are my mom and dad?
Jarod, we've been over this
a thousand times.
Your parents died
in a plane crash.
Yes, I know the story, Sydney.
It's been burned into my brain for 30 years.
But, you see,
I did a little checking.
There's this genetic anomaly
that's in my blood...
that should be in my supposed parents.
But it's not.
Therefore, it's impossible
that I'm their son.
So, the truth, for once.
- [Man] I thought you quit.
- [Miss Parker] Shut up.
Where were you going, Sydney?
- Damn it!
- What?
No smoke!
Out of my way!
I'm sorry, Jarod.
I didn't know.
You have to believe me.
But it doesn't matter.
It matters to me.
I am not gonna be your little
science experiment anymore, Sydney.
I can be anything I want to be.
You trained me well.
I can be a doctor. I can be an engineer.
I can be an astronaut!
And so much more!
But I don't know who I am!
- Tell me who I am.
- I don't know either.
At the time, I had no reason
to question what the Centre told me.
- I swear.
- Then prove it.
Give me tomorrow's code
to the Centre's mainframe.
The truth about who I am
has to be in there.
- You know I can't do that.
- Sydney, you stole my life!
Please give it back to me.
<i>Sydney.! Shoot him.!</i>
7-5-1-2. Go.
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>
- <i>[Sydney] No.! No guns.!</i>
- Let me go!
- <i>[Elevator Bell Dings]</i>

<i>All aboard, please.</i>
Excuse me.
Gwen.
Gwen!
- Dr. Russell.
- Can I speak to you for a minute?
Is there a problem?
You're not supposed to have that.
I knew that Trader was involved.
What I couldn't figure out was
why would anybody help him cover it up?
I don't know
what you're talking about.
I didn't either, until I found this.
It's a printout of your record.
Who else knew you were in prison
besides Trader?
Who the hell are you?
Someone that doesn't think
what happened to Kevin Bailey's fair.
A-And you think I <i>do?</i>
You don't know what it took
for me to get back on my feet.
<i>I've got a job.</i>
I've got a good man.
I've got a beautiful baby boy.
I don't want to lose them.
I don't want you
to lose anything.
<i>Just tell the truth.</i>
What would you do
if your wife came home and told you...
that she'd been a crackhead
and a convict?
<i>I'd say she paid her debt.</i>
And I'd ask her why she didn't
trust me enough to tell me the truth.
At least that's what
I think I would do.
You don't know how scared I am.
I think I do.
I had to page Dr. Trader
that night at the Silver Rail.
<i>We all knew he drank...</i>
but nobody wanted to admit it.
I showed him the X-rays.
Even I knew that the boy
should have been stabilized...
but he insisted I was wrong and...
He was the doctor.
He severed the little boy's spinal cord
when he moved him.
<i>But it was Dr. Hendricks</i>
<i>who covered it all up...</i>
<i>and threatened to expose my past</i>
<i>if I didn't go along.</i>
See, uh...
when Trader realized
what he'd done...
he gave me the pre-op X-rays
and told me to burn them.
<i>But I couldn't.</i>
<i>I went to Dr. Hendricks instead.</i>
I don't know why I thought
it would do any good.
He's been covering for Trader for years.
He took the X-rays...
and he made me swear that I wouldn't
tell anybody that he had 'em.
He said that he might be able
to use them for insurance.
[Sighs]
Thank you.
Dr. Hendricks
isn't gonna give you that film.
He'd rather die
than risk that hospital sale.
- Dr. Trader.
- Alan? It's Jarod.
- We need to talk.
- About what?
Uh, not on the phone.
Can you meet me today
at the Silver Rail at noon?
- I'll be there.
- Thanks, Alan.
<i>[Punching Keypad]</i>
Miles.
Jarod Russell.
Jarod.
What can I do for you?
How about another game
of racquetball?
Why would you want another game
so soon after I crushed you?
[Chuckles] To return the favor.
How about today at noon?
Well, it's your funeral.
Well, we all have to go sometime.
- [Groans]
- Point, game, match.
Toss me my water, will ya?
Sure, Miles.
<i>[Hendricks Grunting]</i>
<i>Geez.</i>
<i>[Sighs]</i>
So, Jarod, why the self-torture?
Well, I figure I let you
win a few games...
I earn your pity,
you cut me a better stock option.
Well, my pity doesn't come cheap.
I'll tell you something... you ran me
all over that court. You are getting better.
- I've been practicing.
- <i>Ah.</i>
But I won.
[Gasping, Panting]
You okay, Miles?
Jarod...
[Gasping]
Miles?
Can somebody
call an ambulance?
Dr. Russell says
he's running a bit late.
Show me a doctor
who isn't, huh?
I'll have another quick one.
<i>Sure.</i>
Get O.R. 3 set.
Dr. Hendricks is having a heart attack.
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Watch your back.!</i>
Pulse is 112 and thready.
B.P. has dropped from 75 to 60.
I want you to start him on a nitro drip
and get him prepped for surgery, stat!
You lied to me.
Last night, you told meJarod came here
to return the five million.
- All he really wanted was the mainframe code.
- <i>It was the least I could do.</i>
He was lied to about his parents.
So was I.
Stop pouting.
It was need-to-know.
You didn't.
Anyway, you've done us all a great favor.
You see, I tagged Jarod's file.
- He logged on this morning.
- Where is he?
Queen of Angels Hospital.
They're bringing the car around now. Let's go.
The Centre wants him alive.
Preferably.
<i>[Monitor Beeping]</i>
Miles, we were unable
to bring in a cardiologist fast enough.
But don't worry.
I paged Dr. Trader.
No...
He'll take care of you, Miles.
- He took care of Kevin Bailey.
- No.
[Gasping]
Please.
You do the operating.
Okay, okay...
O-Okay, Miles. No problem.
But first...
you tell me where
Kevin Bailey's pre-op X-rays are.
[Continues Gasping]
Behind the Punjab painting in my office.
Now, you do the operation, Jarod.
l-l-I'd like to, Miles.
I really would.
But that wouldn't be ethical.
You see...
I'm not really a doctor.
And you're not really
having a heart attack.
Trader, he's all yours.
Okay.
Let's do this.
[Wheezing]
Jarod. Jarod...
[Miss Parker]
We'll start on the first floor and work our way up.
Jarod does not leave.
Nicole?
Would you page Security and have them
stop Dr. Trader from operating?
- He's drunk.
- Oh, my God!
Yeah.
You take that side.
Jarod!
<i>Guess what.</i>
<i>Guess what I did today.!</i>
Oh!
Well, that's great!
Sorry.
He's got to be
in one of these rooms.
<i>[Mrs. Nikkos Screams]</i>
Let's go!
<i>Hey.! A man.!</i>
<i>He ran out the fire escape.!</i>
He's heading to the roof!

<i>Your attention, please.</i>
<i>Flight 1428 to San Diego</i>

[Mews]
<i>You just missed him.</i>
<i>Only been gone a couple days.</i>
<i>[Man #2]</i>
<i>I'll check the dresser.</i>
How did he look?
Oh. About 6'2",
170 pounds, I guess.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>That's not what I mean.</i>
<i>I mean, was he okay?</i>
<i>Did he seem in good health?</i>
Are you kiddin'? Man had a physique
the pros would kill for.
<i>[Man] So, tell me, uh, if Mr. Spitz</i>
<i>wasn't really an atomic engineer...</i>
how did he stop the nuke plant
from turnin' us into pork rind?
- Mr. Spitz is, um...
- A fascinating man.
Oh.
So, any stab atJarod's Oedipal tragedy,
Dr. Freud?
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Jarod. That was his first name, yeah.</i>
<i>Strange...</i>
but you'd think a grown man
with a last name of Spitz...
<i>would already know</i>
<i>how to swim, wouldn't ya?</i>
He was here for swimming lessons?
Hey, we are the "Y."
He was a quick learner too.
From Pike to Advanced Adult
in just five weeks.
Day in, day out,
swimming was all he did.
Except for this past week.
He spent every second in the pool,
but he didn't swim a stroke.
What do you mean?
From the time we opened in the morning
until the midnight crew closed her down...
he'd be there in the deep end...
treading water without ever stopping.
Just treading water.
I wonder what your science project
is up to now.
<i>[Woman Over Radio]</i>
<i>Banking two-niner and heading down.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Go in for a closer look.</i>
<i>It's smoking pretty badly.</i>
<i>I'll call in a rescue craft.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>She's going overboard.</i>
There's no time!
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Jarod, no.!</i>
<i>Come on, Jarod.</i>
[Coughing]
Hello. My name is Jarod.
You're gonna be just fine.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>Miss Parker, you have a fax.</i>
[Together]
1,324.
- <i>[Door Opens, Closes]</i>
- Very good, girls, and absolutely correct.
Sydney, now!
Your theatrics upset the children.
Save the Mr. Rogers, Syd.
I set up a text session with Broots
so that he can help us trackJarod.
I think that takes precedence
over Thing 1 and Thing 2.
Broots's technology isn't going
to help us track a chameleon.
Jarod changes color.
He blends in.
We'll get close when he lets us.
Patience, Parker.
We need patience.
Syd, patience may be
a soothing catchall...
for the potato heads
in Psychogenic Services.
But my father and the boys in the Tower
equate patience with failure.
ButJarod is a Pretender.
He can become
anyone he wants to be.
We'll never catch him
with one of Broots's phone taps.
That's what they said
about the Unabomber, Syd.
And how did they catch
that whacked-out prodigy?
A letter to Mommy.
It's the smart ones
who always do something stupid.
Let's use the stairs.
It's only three flights up. Come on.
- Stop nurturing, Sydney.
- [Elevator Bell Dings]
Hell, it's been 20 years. I don't have
any problem riding this elevator.
You shouldn't either.
Your mother was a special person.
My mother was weak. Period.
She couldn't handle the pressures
of S.I.S. or this place.
I don't have that problem.
Only thing that
ever bothered me was...
why in an elevator?
They go up, they go down.
They end up nowhere.
It's amazing how a single bullet
can change your life.
If you ever want to talk about it...
Correct me if I'm wrong, Sydney,
but wasn't my mother's session with you...
one of the last things she did
before she got on this elevator?
- No, thanks.
- [Elevator Bell Dings]
[Chuckles]
Sydney, I'll take my own chances.
[Chattering]
Martha.
Good morning.
- You look way too rested to be
staying in Coast Guard housing.
- I live off-base.
It took three years and a husband
to get me out of the iron cot.
- How'd you swing it?
- I forged my transfer papers.
[Laughs]
Oh.
Martha, are you okay?
Yeah, it's uh, bad sushi.
- Is there any other kind?
- Lieutenant Campbell. Good morning.
- Good morning.
- I'm glad I caught you.
I wanted you to meet my
lieutenant commander, Paul Bilson.
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Word is you did some pretty
good work out there yesterday.
Heard you even plucked a victim
out of the soup.
Well, it's a good thing
I took those swim lessons at the "Y."
[Laughing] I wish all my transfers
had your humility, not to mention talent.
<i>Commander Powell, I was hoping to get</i>
<i>a few minutes regarding my rank review.</i>
- Well, all rank reviews go through the L.C.
- <i>I know. It's on my desk.</i>
- I'll get on it A.S.A.P.
- Thank you, sir.
<i>Well, I'll leave you in</i>
<i>abler hands, Lt. Campbell.</i>
Thank you, sir.
<i>Well, the real question is,</i>
<i>what kind of sea legs do you have?</i>
As you know,
anybody can fly, right, Poole?
A kite maybe, sir.
Lieutenant.
Good morning, L.C.
Hey, got the <i>Christi</i> purrin' like a kitten.
- I don't trust that old nag. I'll take the 45.
- Yes, sir!
Commander Powell likes his men to be
real sailors. You up for some sea duty?
- As ready as I'll ever be, sir.
- Javi, we're waiting!
<i>[Javi]</i>
<i>Rumble Base Alpha signing off.</i>
Haven't you ever heard
of the Internet? E-mail?
- I'm a purist. I crave static.
- You comin'?
Yeah.
- Hi. Jarod Campbell.
- Javi Padilla.
Nice to meet you.
Is Bilson always in such a hurry?
Only when the ocean calls.
Commander Powell tells me you've been
running icebreakers off Katima Bay.
Great Lakes? You didn't tell me
this was a freshwater boy, sir.
Ah, give me a break.
At least I transferred to the unit...
with the best S.A.R. record
in the Guard.
You're damn right. We conducted
178 search-and-rescues last year alone.
<i>Whoo.!</i>
<i>[Bilson]</i>
<i>Looks like a 42-80 to me.</i>
It's listing about three degrees.
Abandoned?
<i>[Bilson]</i>
<i>That's my guess. Javi, call it in.</i>
Jarod, check it out.
<i>Hello?</i>
It's the Coast Guard.
Is anybody here? Hello?
Whoa, now, sir.
Nobody's here to hurt you.
[Both Laughing]
Oh, hell.
<i>Roy Abbott, say hello to Lt. Campbell.</i>
<i>Hi. Call meJarod.</i>
Get off my boat.
Ah, come on, Roy.
Is that any way to treat the new guy?
Sir.
Your stores appear to be low,
and you also appear to be taking on water.
Why don't you let us tow you ashore
so we can help you resupply?
Nothin' I need over there.
I'm fine where I am.
<i>[Bilson]</i>
<i>Mr. Abbott, the commander did not agree.</i>
You have one week to come in,
or we're authorized to bring you in, sir.
It's for your own good, Mr. Abbott.
- <i>[Telephone Ringing]</i>
- Sydney.
Well, I'm surprised you're not out
making rounds down Corridor 15.
<i>Even a psychiatrist</i>
<i>needs a day off.</i>
And all this time, I thought
your interest in me was purely paternal.
I understand learning to swim,
but aren't you a little old...
to be playing with bathtub toys?
Well, it's certainly better than the kind
of playtime you foisted upon me.
It's funny.
I can't see their faces.
But their eyes...
they won't stop staring at me.
- <i>Whose eyes, Jarod?</i>
- I don't know.
Dead eyes.
Eyes of people
that aren't alive today...
because of how you exploited
my simulations.
And now, you want
to right those wrongs...
by using your gift
as an avenging angel.
- <i>Is that it?</i>
- Something like that.
[Sydney]
Then why are you calling?
I wanted to know if...
ifJarod was my real name.
I think it is.
At least, that's what I was told.
Thank you, Sydney.
Don't hang up.
I'm worried about you.
If you're so worried about me,
why don't you go to the authorities?
- You know I can't do that.
- Why?
Because you love me?
Or because you're afraid
of what I know?
Jarod, if those people from the beltway
find out what you have...
I won't be able to protect you.
If they find out what I have...
you won't be able
to protect yourselves.
Those D.S.A.'s contain my work.
No, Sydney.
They contain my life.
Good-bye.
[Sighs]
We got you, genius.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Now this is very interesting.</i>
You mean somebody actually manufactures...
imitation canine feces?
Yep. Only they couldn't
fit all that on the label...
so they just call it fake dog poop.
Oh.
And why exactly would
somebody want fake dog poop?
'Cause it's funny.
- Oh.
- No, I mean the white ones. Yeah.
<i>Thank you.</i>
It is funny.
I got the white ones, Mommy.
Those were his favorites.
<i>[Miss Parker] Broots traced</i>
<i>Jarod's call back to this Y.M.C.A.</i>
Get him!
Hey, hey, hey! I ain't done nothin'.
I ain't done nothin'.
What are you doing in this room?
I ain't trespassin'. No.
This guy gave me the room.
- Is this the man?
- <i>Yeah, that-that's him.</i>
And you know what?
He conducts the philharmonic. Mm-hmm.
<i>And-And he gives me six months'</i>
<i>free rentjust to transfer his calls.</i>
<i>And you know what?</i>
<i>He says he likes to travel a lot.</i>
Shut up, Sydney.
<i>[Opera Over Radio]</i>
- [Whistling]
- <i>Good morning, Mr. Abbott.</i>
What do you want?
I don't know.
I was just passing through.
Permission to come aboard?
Granted.
<i>Magdeline's</i> a pretty lady.
How do you know Magdeline?
I was talking about your boat.
Is that your wife?
Could've been.
Probably would've.
I never asked her.
Do you think the Dutchman
ever found his lost love?
<i>What?</i>
<i>The opera you were listening to.</i>
<i>Wagner's</i> Dutchman.
<i>That's the story.</i>
<i>I always wondered...</i>
if he ever searched for his love...
or spent the rest of his days
floating around on that ghost ship.
I never really gave it much thought.
It's not easy wondering
if someone you love is still out there.
I ain't movin' my boat.
I'm not asking you to.
Don't that uniform make it your job?
I'm just borrowing the uniform.
<i>I brought you some supplies from town.</i>
<i>I'll trade you for...</i>
this chest you carved.
Throw in some candles next time
you pass, you got yourself a deal.
Done. Thanks.
Do you ever listen to Mozart, Mr. Abbott?
The Magic Flute?
I like this one fine.
It's all I need.
I was allowed to listen to it
once when I was a child.
I'd close my eyes,
and in my mind...
I became an eagle.
I could go anywhere, do anything.
Nothing could stop me.
Maybe Mozart knew something
that Wagner didn't.
I ain't movin' my boat.
Lt. Campbell,
even on routine patrol...
I expect your eyes on the deck.
This is a helicopter, not a library.
Trying to orient myself to
the West Coast ocean search patterns.
Tell you what.
I will buy you lunch...
if you let me pick your brain
about some of these old searches.
As long as it's not sushi.
Great. I don't want
Commander Powell...
to tag me "Freshwater Boy"
on my rank review.
Wait a minute.
You've been here three days,
and you're getting a rank review?
Oh, great! All I need
is another guy in this operation...
- <i>elbowing for room on the ladder.</i>
- When are you due?
I should've made L.C. months ago...
but Commander Powell
keeps putting it off.
Not your promotion.
Your baby.
I'd say from your nausea and your sore back,
you're about nine weeks.
My husband doesn't even know.
What are you, a part-time obstetrician?
No, but I was a midwife once.
You haven't told
the commander yet, have you?
Hell no! If Powell or anyone else
around here finds out about this...
I can kiss away
my chances at L.C.
Your secret's safe with me.
<i>Well, Broots, what happened?</i>
I'm backtracking his call
through the other phone.
All I know right now is that
they're all international landlines.
- I didn't even know that was possible.
- How long to trace it?
Uh, that's hard to say.
I mean, Jarod's method
is so basic, so simple.
Uh, 20... 24 hours.
You have 12.
I can do it in eight.
The King file?
You certainly picked a sensitive one.
It's all downhill after this.
You-You should talk to Bilson.
This was his baby.
- <i>How so?</i>
- Well, it happened during
his regular Tuesday night patrol.
So, Bilson was in charge.
It was a tough one too. No one
was sure how King's boat went down.
Never did find it.
This one was particularly sad.
Coroner said Tom King treaded water
a day and a half before he drowned.
<i>For an S.A.R. team</i>
<i>that's come up empty...</i>
that's the kind of news
that hurts the most.
This report says that
the search patterns were based...
on water current information
provided by directional buoys.
Yep.
I dropped them myself. Here.
Pilcher's Point.
That's the area Tom King
was known to have been fishing in.
So Bilson deployed standard grid searches
southeast of that point?
That's S.O.P. You seem to be
following this fine. What is the matter?
According to satellite monitoring...
the D.F. buoys indicated that
the current was moving southwest.
- You're doing it wrong.
- Hmm?
Didn't you ever
eat cookies as a kid?
They didn't have cookies
where I grew up.
Where'd you grow up... Mars?
Sort of.
First, you twist the cookie...
so the top comes off
like a little lid.
Then, you get all the white stuff off.
I pick it with my teeth,
but you can scrape it or lick it.
Then what do you do
with the brown part?
Grown-ups put it in ice cream.
Why don't they just sell
the white stuff?
It wouldn't be any fun.
Hmm.
Your mom works hard.
Since my dad died,
that's all she does.
He's with St. Andrew...
the one for fishermen.
I got my dad a statue
of him at church.
It was on his boat.
They never found that.
It's hard to lose a parent.
I know.
What part do you miss the most?
My mom's smile.
- <i>[Young Jarod] I can't figure it out.!</i>
- <i>[Sydney] You have to.</i>
How much oxygen is left?
Less than 48 hours.
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>Well, what caused the explosion?</i>
- We don't know!
- Fuel.
Oxygen.
There's nothing that can save us!
- It's your duty to save your crew!
- No! I can't do it!
You shut down now, you all die!
[Sighs]
Come on, Jarod! Think!
[Young Jarod]
Wait! Wait! I've got it! I've got it!
I can use the gravitational pull
of the moon to help get us back.
Very good, Jarod. I knew
you would save them if you wanted to.
They didn't want to save Tom King.
They wanted him to die.
<i>[Telephone Ringing]</i>
What?
Oh! I intentionally wake you
in your deepest sleep phase...
- and all I get is a lifeless "what"?
- [Sighs]
You want wit, read Noel Coward.
<i>What time is it where you are?</i>
Cute. Not funny, but cute.
You're making house calls now.
I'm honored.
Well, I was feeling a little guilty
about my virtual phone game.
You know, I really should tape this
to replay at the Christmas party.
You'll be there, you know,
rest assured.
- I'm not resting much at all these days.
- Breaking my heart.
So, Jarod...
why the Y.M.C.A.?
I was watching retro night on VH1,
and they were doing the '70s...
which, as you know, I missed.
There was this singing group that was
extolling the virtues of staying at the "Y."
So, here I am.
Cute. Not funny, but cute.
Did you know that
they make fake dog poop?
It's amazing...
how it appears to be one thing...
- but it's really something completely different.
- <i>[Clatters On Table]</i>
And I should care because...
Well, this sort of thing could be
a real moneymaker for the Centre.
Besides, isn't it
the perfect metaphor...
for the way your father and the Centre
distort the truth?
- And what truth is that, Jarod?
- It's all in the note I sent you.
The truth about
what makes you sad.
<i>[Boat Departing]</i>
<i>[Horn Honks]</i>
I doubt the boys back at Katima Bay
are sittin' beach-side this time of year.
Probably freezing their butts off
on some futile cape-hopping S.A.R.
So, um, beside the obvious,
why pull up stakes?
Well, I was feeling kind of
cooped up where I was living.
So I decided to head out west.
I interviewed at
the Channel Islands Station first...
but I decided that
this was the spot for me.
Well, you made the right decision.
The Channel Islands
is full of our rejects.
- That's funny.
- Here you go, sir.
They said that this group
was a bunch of renegades.
That's a crock.
They said guys who couldn't rescue
a fisherman from their own bay...
didn't deserve to wear the uniform.
Were they talking about
the King rescue?
Yes, I think that was the name they used.
Did something go wrong?
<i>You know, it's amazing how the people</i>
<i>we put our lives on the line for...</i>
can just turn around and
smear the Guard with one news story.
<i>The man's wife took it hard.</i>
<i>She blamed us.</i>
I understand her tragedy.
I guess she had to blame somebody,
so she could deal with it.
<i>I promise you.</i>
We did everything we could do
to save that man.
We did our job.
<i>[Martha]</i>
<i>Pilcher's Point is where Tom King...</i>
<i>was known</i>
<i>to have been fishing.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>The current was going southwest.</i>
<i>[Martha] No one was sure how</i>
<i>King's boat went down. Never did find it.</i>
<i>[Telephone Ringing]</i>
What? I'm on my way.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>It wasn't easy, but l-I have to admit...</i>
<i>figuring Jarod's mind</i>
<i>is a real treat.</i>
- He's a damn clever guy.
- He's a one-man Siegfried and Roy.
- Show me what you have.
- Okay.
We backtracked the call we thought
was coming from this Y.M.C. A...
<i>from Jarod's room</i>... <i>Room 334.</i>
<i>Jarod interconnected</i>
<i>173 international calls...</i>
<i>but-but backtracking</i>
<i>those calls was impossible...</i>
<i>because instead of a call-forwarding</i>
<i>device triggered by a single call...</i>
<i>all 173 calls...</i>
<i>were individually initiated.</i>
Ingenious.
<i>[Broots] And a hell of a lot of work</i>
<i>forJarod, I might add, and very expensive.</i>
I don't care what it cost.
Oh, that's good, because
Jarod charged it to your calling card.
Where is he?
Oh, the-the last place
we would expect to look.
- <i>[Chuckles] Room 335.</i>
- In the same "Y"?
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Yeah, in the very next room.</i>
[Chuckles]
Gotcha.
I found this at
a novelty shop on the pier.
- Yeah, very funny.
- Just when you think it's your lucky day...
you find out it's not.
<i>So, what are you doing here?</i>
Same as you.
Looking for peace of mind.
And the answer to why
she'll never see her father again.
- Who the hell are you, huh?
- I don't really know.
But last night I became you...
and I realized
why you come here so much...
why you feel so guilty...
and why you and Bilson
didn't save her father's life.
We searched for him for two days.
But you made sure that the search was in
areas that you knew he wouldn't be found.
You couldn't afford for him
to be found alive, could you?
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about!
I know you and Bilson make the same patrol
on the south sector every Tuesday night.
<i>And every Wednesday afternoon,</i>
<i>you make a rather sizable deposit...</i>
<i>into your private account</i>
<i>on Coronado.</i>
So what kind of contraband
were you running?
- You're crazy, man.
- Am I? The paint on the hull.
<i>It's gonna match the rescue cruiser</i>
<i>that you and Bilson were in...</i>
<i>the night that he went down.</i>
You can search everywhere
you want for salvation.
The only place you're gonna find it
is in the truth you're running from.
<i>[Javi]</i>
<i>Me and Bilson meet a Mexican hauler...</i>
named the <i>Santa Marca</i>
every Tuesday night...
bringing in a shipment
of something.
I think it's rock,
but I'm not positive.
We're just paid delivery boys.
I don't know how we hit his boat.
I mean, it was foggy.
I just-just couldn't see it.
But we sheared it right in half.
<i>And then</i>...
Then I swung around and...
and I spotted him in the water.
He was still alive.
Yeah.
And he looked up at me, and...
and all I can think was...
"What a small world," you know?
I used to see him with his daughter
and his wife at Mass...
and I think
he recognized me too.
And then he put
his hand up to me.
So I tried to pull him on board...
but Bilson stopped me.
He literally put a gun to my head
and told me to leave him.
- And if you saved him...
- That we'd go to jail.
<i>But I'll take prison in a heartbeat...</i>
if I can get out of this hell I'm in.
Hey, could you do me a favor?
Now, that's funny.
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
- Late for what?
- Patrol.
I just got the call this morning
about riding with you.
- Riding with me? Where's Javi?
- I don't know, sir.
They told me he was sick.
- Sick?
- Actually, I'm not feeling very well myself.
Bad sushi. Do you mind if
I hit the head and catch up with you?
Nah, sure, sure.
Is there something wrong?
No, everything's great.
All right.
I will see you in a minute.
- Where's 45?
- I guess it's on patrol. The <i>Christi's</i>...
Yeah, purring.
I know.
Javi?
Javi?
<i>[Man Over Radio]</i>
Santa Marca <i>to Robin 247.</i>
Santa Marca <i>to Robin 247.</i>
Come in, 247.
Are you insane? We don't have
scheduled radio contact until tonight.
We're confirming
we got your message.
At your request, the rendezvous
will be at 10:00 a.m. today.
You will be there, Javi?
Hello? Javi?
Right. Today.
I'll be there.
Adios.
Well, there you are, sir.
<i>I'm ready if you are.</i>
Oh, that's all right, Lieutenant.
It's-It's a routine patrol.
- <i>I'll do it alone.</i>
- Are you sure, sir?
- Yeah, yeah. Go take care of your gut.
- Well, thank you, sir.
You didn't tell us he lived next door.
You didn't ask.
Paint.
Come on.
[Engine Stalls]
[Engine Cranking]
Excuse me.
Have either of you seen this man?
Well, that's great.
That's just great.
Purring like a damn kitten.
Robin 247 to <i>Santa Marca.</i>
Come in, <i>Santa Marca.</i>
Rescue 45, come in.
Is that you, Javi?
Rescue 45, you're on a direct course
to my craft. Veer off.
Rescue 45, veer off!
Rescue 45,
you're coming right at me!
Rescue 45, veer off!
Hey!
- Oh, my God!
- What the hell's wrong with you, man?
- You blind or somethin'? Come on! Toss me a line!
- I can't, sir.
- What?
- I'm sorry, but I can't rescue you.
You're bucking for
a court-martial, Lieutenant!
Well, that is serious, sir.
But, you see, a court-martial,
it won't exactly affect me.
<i>I'm not really a lieutenant.</i>
<i>The truth is...</i>
I'm not really in the Coast Guard.
You get me out of here!
Oh, don't worry.
You'll be okay.
Men have been known
to tread water for days.
- This isn't funny!
- <i>Oh, you're right. It's terrifying.</i>
You're all alone.
You can't see anything
but water...
and you start thinking about
what might be down there...
<i>whatjust bumped you</i>
<i>below the suryace.</i>
<i>But after a while,</i>
<i>your nerves will settle down.</i>
<i>But, unfortunately,</i>
<i>that's when your body starts to ache...</i>
and the only way to stop the pain...
is to stop treading.
<i>But then you start to sink.</i>
<i>And in that instant</i>
<i>between life and death...</i>
<i>you think about all the people</i>
<i>and all the things you left behind.</i>
<i>So you start fighting your way</i>
<i>back to the suryace.</i>
You fight for your life.
- You can't leave me here!
- <i>Sure, I can.</i>
Just like you left Tom King.
<i>No.!</i>
No!
[Gasping]
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>
<i>There's something you have to see.</i>
What's this?
<i>[Javi]</i>
<i>It's the truth, sir.</i>
[Jarod]
Rescue Unit 45 to Base.
Requesting pickup near
D.F. buoy number 29.
But take your time getting there.
Just a little floating debris.
[Miss Parker]
There he is!
[Sydney]
Hello, Jarod!
Hello, Sydney!
[Miss Parker]
Give that to me!
There's nowhere to go this time!
Sydney raised me to believe
my mind can take me anywhere!
[Engines Stall]
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>He's out of fuel.</i>
Like I told you, Sydney.
The smart ones always do something stupid.
Get him.
- <i>[Sydney] He's not there?</i>
- <i>How?</i>
I don't know.
But he left you this.
<i>[Opera]</i>
- Hiya, Roy!
- Jarod?
Nice day for a swim!
[Inaudible]
[Clattering]
- What's that, Sydney?
- I don't know.
[Woman] No! No!
[Screaming, Sobbing]
- They're trying to hurt her!
- Stay here, Jarod.
- No!
- [Man] Get her out of the elevator!
- <i>[Young Jarod] Stop it.!</i>
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>
- [Man] Get the kid out of here!
- Stop!
<i>[Gunfire]</i>
- [Girl Screaming] Mama!
- No, keep her back! Keep her back!
- [Young Jarod] Leave me alone!
- <i>No.! Mama.!</i>
[Sobbing]
It's me.
I wanna know what
really happened to my mom.
- Thanks, Roy.
- It ain't nothin'.
Magdeline's out there somewhere.
What are you gonna do?
I think I'll take a walk.
Thank you.
How about you?
I think I'll take a drive.
<i>[Cheering]</i>
<i>[Man Over P.A.]</i>
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines.!</i>
Okay, Jarod, you're set.
[Mews]
<i>Oh, man.</i>
<i>What did he say?</i>
A natural heat vortex.
That's what he called it.
And he was right.
See out there?
The cool breezes from the ocean
mixing with the steamin' desert air...
make, like, a big...
wind collision thing,
and that's what runs the windmills.
You figured that out
by yourself?
Not me. Jarod.
- <i>[Bird Screeches]</i>
- Did it by watching them.
<i>Without moving a muscle,</i>
<i>they can just...</i>
hover in the vortex.
He just sat in this spot
all day.
Just eatin' Pez
and taking in the hawks.
I'm surprised your Dr. Dolittle
didn't try talking to them.
<i>Well, it wasn'tjust</i>
<i>the birds he was into.</i>
He really dug these.
He'd, like, be throwing dust at 'em
all day, saying he was figuring the...
updrafts and
the air currents and stuff.
- Righteous, huh?
- Lovely.
Oh, Jarod.
What are you up to now?
<i>Whoo-hoo.!</i>
<i>[Laughing]</i>
That was great!
Congratulations.
You just beat the gauntlet.
This is so cool.
Well, Jarod, the audition's over.
You want the job, it's yours.
Want it? I could
stay up here forever.
<i>Hee-hee.!</i>
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
Well, Mr. Matthews, for an ex-fighter jock,
you've done pretty good for yourself.
Well, Yeager sells batteries.
I've got SkyVionics. A buck's a buck.
The end of the Cold War nearly killed
most of the defense contractors...
yet your stock's up, what,
17% last quarter alone?
- Eighteen.
- Whoo! Maybe I should buy me a little.
Well, with the Scimitar
chip about to be approved...
maybe you should
buy yourself a lot.
- Is that a Draken?
- Yeah. Uncle Sam's not the only
one with a shrinking purse.
We're testing the Scimitar
in planes from the R.A.F., the Israelis.
Hell, even the frogs
sent over a Mirage.
- You seen Dixon?
- Yeah. There's the wild man now.
<i>He's a good pilot,</i>
<i>but punctuality's not his thing.</i>
<i>He'll probably miss</i>
<i>his own funeral.</i>
- You're late.
- Yeah, but what an entrance.
- So, how'd he do?
- Only took him one week to do
three weeks' worth of tests.
- That makes him the new king of the mountain.
- You serious?
He scored 34%.
- Ah, it was no big deal.
- <i>Oh, it is when Dix here only scores 33.</i>
Even so, I want you to
shadow this hotshot.
He'll show you everything you need to know
about the new system.
<i>Then you can teach him how to beat</i>
<i>the gauntlet. At the end of the week...</i>
I'll decide who gets to be my
wingman for the Pentagon test.
No pressure.
So, Jarod, I heard you ran some
flights for the Agency.
- Who was your point man?
- Andrew Sterling.
Original secret agent man.
Yeah, I ran some TR-1 recons over Singapore
for him back in the '80s.
North Korea.
Right.
Well, I can't believe I'm actually flying
for Manhunter Matthews.
He's the second-best pilot
I've ever seen.
And who's the best?
You're looking at him.
- How does it feel up there?
- Ah, smooth. I can't wait to get this baby back up.
Body by F-16.
Brains by yours truly.
<i>The Scimitar chip makes any plane's onboard</i>
<i>computer work 10 times as fast as the others.</i>
Well, in this game,
speed means life.
Glad to see Tom's finally got himself
some A1 jocks to keep up.
Quality control problems?
- Mr. Lawson.
- Depends on who you ask.
I'd appreciate the latest
hydraulic specs.
- You're beginning to sound like
a broken record, Lieutenant.
- Quick way to fix that.
Yes, ma'am.
<i>[Lieutenant] Stereographs.</i>
<i>They say there's a picture in there somewhere...</i>
<i>but I've never</i>
<i>been able to see one.</i>
A penguin at the Sphinx.
A penguin riding a camel.
A penguin on a Nile barge.
Now that's something
you don't see very often.
I could look at these things
for a week. Nothing.
Well, it's all in
the ocular muscles.
The key is you focus
on the poster...
but you move your primary eyesight
eight degrees to the left.
<i>[Lieutenant]</i>
<i>What did you do? Invent these things?</i>
<i>Mmm. Not officially.</i>
- Jarod Wright.
- You're Ronald Collins's replacement.
- LieutenantJanice Gant.
- Nice to meet you.
Penguin, huh?
Penguin.
I see you met
Miss Congeniality.
Toughest S.P.O.
in the field.
Ah. So she's
the special projects officer.
Blue-suiters sent her
to keep tabs on us.
Which reminds me. Clearview Ridge.

You lean on the throttle anywhere near there,

Clearview Ridge.
Thanks for the tip.
<i>[Plane Engine Roaring]</i>
<i>[Young Sydney] Don't tell me what you see,</i>
<i>Jarod. Tell me what you feel.</i>
Tell me what you feel.
I feel tired. My legs hurt.
<i>[Young Sydney]</i>
<i>Push with the pain. Focus. We need details.</i>
This helmet's too tight.
It's hot.
I don't like this.
<i>Why can't I get a bike</i>

<i>Sydney.</i>
[No Audible Dialogue]
<i>[Knocking On Door]</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Just a minute.</i>
- Hello, Mr. Hollis. How are you?
- Fine. Super. Great.
- <i>Can I help you with something?</i>
- Why do you need a second phone line?
It's for my modem.
I'm uploading something.
Oh. One of those.
- One of those?
- Sheep. People who don't mind
giving up their privacy.
- Baa!
- Excuse me?
It's too late.
They know.
- They?
- The black helicopters. The gray men.
Like those SkyVionics people.
I've been on that place.
Been out there since World War II...
doing some very
cockamamy things.
What's in the case?
- Memories.
- Pictures?
Something like that.
Why would you want a computer
if I gave you a perfectly good TV?
See? Universal remote even.
Runs everything but your life.
Yes. But they could be
watching you through the TV.
No reverse-imaging device.
I inspected it.
<i>I also took the liberty...</i>
of programming this to skip channels
with subliminal mind control.
Well, that was very considerate
of you, Mr. Hollis.
You aren't uploading
filthy pictures, are you?
Well, that depends
on how you define filthy.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>It came down the linejust a few minutes ago.</i>
Jarod.
<i>This better be good, Syd.</i>
<i>Mr. Raines?</i>
<i>How did he find out about him?</i>
<i>Must be the disks from</i>
<i>the digital simulation archive.</i>
Do you think he realizes
what it means?
We're talking aboutJarod.
If he doesn't now,
he soon will.
<i>He is a genius.</i>
You can stretch it...
bounce it

Yeah. See, the egg is like a symbol

<i>Its being.</i>
<i>It's notjust putty.</i>
It's whatever
you want it to be.
Oh.
Well, why would they call

I don't know.
But I'll buy this.
I'll buy 100.
Cool.

Hello. You must beJarod.
[Mouthing Words]
We'll be very happy
to help you with that.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>The view is better from the inside.</i>
Thought I smelled some smoke.
Everything seems to be A-okay.
Good.
Never figured you
for a pilot.
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I'm not really a pilot.
Oh, right.
I'm Jimmy Hoffa.
Could have told me.
Man likes to know when he's about to
have his throat ripped out and fed to him.
It didn't seem important.
Important?
Does that look important?
Fleets of these behemoths,
like crazed flying monkeys...
terrorizing U.S. citizens
from Seattle to Miami.
Terrorizing?
Halcion gas.
C.I.A. created it in 1971.
- 1969.
- I knew it. You're one of them.
Would you stop, please?
This is a mass hallucinogen.
This is pretty potent.
Well, not anymore.
I cut it with 50% oxygen.
Hell, your dentist
has stronger stuff.
Even so, I caught
an accidental whiff.
Thought I was Eleanor Roosevelt
for the best part of an afternoon.
- Your point being?
- Remember the medfly?
No such thing.
Lock your doors
and bolt your windows, amigo.
The exterminator's coming,
and his name is SkyVionics.
- SkyVionics?
- Merchants of death. Trust me.
I've been a clown
in that circus...
and it's anything but
the Greatest Show on Earth.
<i>[Chattering]</i>
<i>[Country]</i>
<i>[Singing In Spanish]</i>
That's quite a collection.
The only thing we have now to hang up there
is you, the SkyVionic boys...
since we don't have
a base anymore.
What's your poison?
- Excuse me?
- What's your drink?
Uh, I was raised on optimized
nutritional supplements:
hearts of palm, wheatgrass,
asparagus mixed with tomato.
Virgin Mary,
celery garnished.
Uh, could you make it two, please?
I'm expecting company.
Mm-hmm.
What the hell do you think
you were doing up there?
- Practice makes perfect.
- You know what I'm talking about, Wright.
Clearview Ridge.
I was retracing
Ronald Collins's last flight.
<i>Two Virgin Marys.</i>
I hope this is your poison.
- You knew I'd come after you.
- Toughest S.P.O. in the field.
At least that's what
they tell me.
<i>So, Lieutenant Gant...</i>
why is the air force so concerned
with a civilian flier?
You're testing a system that's designed
to protect military pilots.
It's my job to make sure
it's safe.
And I'm up for wingman
on Friday's test.
I don't fly avionics
I'm not familiar with.
It's my job to know
what I'm getting into.
True.
Now, from what I understand,
Collins had plenty of time to eject.
Time, yes.
Ability, no.
His record in the Gulf
says otherwise.
Well, between me and you
and that wall of fame...
Collins didn't eject
because he blacked out.
<i>What are you saying?</i>
Put it this way.
His drink of choice was not a Virgin Mary.
- Is that true?
- You can take my word for it...
or steal my report
from the Special Projects Office in D.C.
Now that would be impossible.
Look, not even his wife fought the allegations,
and they cost her his pension.
Two SkyVionics employees place Collins
right here in this very bar...
- <i>the night before the crash.</i>
- Who?
<i>Lawson, for one.</i>
Who else?
Tom Matthews.
<i>[Matthews On Radio]</i>
<i>Nice flying, Jarod. Bring it on home.</i>
- You weren't kidding when you
said you were a quick study.
- Ah. Beginner's luck.
We're making a big announcement
after the test.
Scimitar's going commercial.
By the year 2000, that Scimitar chip's
gonna be on every airliner in the country.
I feel safer already.
Well, I just want you to know
I've been talking to corporate types about you.
You're our best flier,
hands down.
- But?
- But I gotta give the test to Dixon on Friday.
I understand.
You don't want a repeat of the last test.
We won't.
This time no test pilot's gonna let me down.
Ron Collins could have
flown circles around you two.
Instead he hit the bottle.
I'm surprised you missed that.
I called him on it the morning of the test.
He said he was fine.
So it wasn't
a mechanical failure.
The residual alcohol
in his blood...
caused him to black out
when he pulled too many g's.
Collins was flying a safe plane.
I'm sure he was.
Is your mom home?
Mom!
You were with Ron
in Saudi Arabia?
Your husband... he saved my tail
on the third night over Baghdad.
<i>When I heard about</i>
<i>the accident, l</i>...
<i>Well, I tried to make my way here</i>
<i>as soon as I could.</i>
I want to tell you
how sorry I am.
Me and a couple of the guys,
we petitioned the C.N.O.'s office...
about getting Ron a posthumous
Gulf War commendation.
What's wrong, Mom?
Nothin'.
That's great.
That's really great.
Have you had supper yet?
You're saying Jarod
left this for us.
When I tried to save
this picture of Mr. Raines...
it unzipped an executable
that created this program.
And I'll be able to communicate
with him and see him?
Through his encryption,
yes.
I don't want Miss Parker
to find out about this.
Uh, wait... wait a minute.
Uh, you want to play political Parcheesi
with the ice queen, you go...
[Growls]
You go right ahead, but I'm not dancing
in that minefield. No way.
[Laughing]
You are afraid of losing your job.
I'm afraid of losing my life.
<i>[Jarod] Hey. You get hot dogs</i>
<i>and macaroni for dinner every night?</i>
I wish.
It's quite a view, huh?
That's Orion, the hunter.
- And that one's Pegasus.
- The winged horse.
That was Dad's favorite. I can name
a lot of stars. Dad and I studied 'em.
We went to see 'em in the desert
the night before he left.
Really?
- Just you and your dad?
- Shh.
Mom never liked it
when we snuck out late.
We never told her.
<i>Hey, Jarod.</i>
<i>Don't forget.</i>
Tomorrow I need you to
play bogey in the Draken.
- Where is it?
- They're prepping in number 27.
- That's two hangars down.
- Thanks.
How many hours you logged
in one of those?
Well, actually,
this'll be my...
first.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Looks likeJarod's been busy.</i>
<i>This image was taken last night</i>
<i>by one of our KH-11 satellites.</i>
- That's La Grange.
- Mm-hmm.
- La Grange?
- One of the Centre's private, unmarked airstrips.
- That's somewhere in Virginia, right?
- <i>Right. It's just outside of D.C.</i>
This shot's just before 2:00 a.m.
Nothing up the sleeve, right?
<i>And presto.</i>
- [Mispronouncing] Draken jet.
- Draken.
Oh. Parked there
for three hours until...
- Poof.
- He landed there in the middle
of the night, undetected?
And three hours gives him
perfect time for a visit to D.C.
Why Washington?

Let's try that again at Mach 1.8.
- Throw in a shoulder roll for good measure.
- Come and get me, Manhunter.
<i>[Matthews]</i>
<i>Coming in for the kill. Say your prayers, Hammer.</i>

<i>Pull out of the roll, Collins. Pull out of the roll.</i>
<i>You're headin'down.</i>

<i>Collins, punch out.!</i>
<i>Level off, Collins.</i>
<i>You're going down.</i>
<i>Get out of there.</i>
<i>Punch out.! Punch out.!</i>
<i>Collins.! Collins.!</i>
You couldn't punch out...
because Matthews sent you up
in an unsafe plane.
If you don't understand,
we'll just try again. Okay?

Hmm.
- Broke?
- Defective.
Hey, you're
the mechanical whiz.
The specs say there's
a failure rate of 0.4%.
So?
So, I've done my own calculations,
and I've come up with a failure rate of...
3.1%.
Sounds like a bad chip.
You're the expert.
- That's a Scimitar chip.
- Mm-hmm.
And when it fails,
whole plane's affected.
Altitude controls...
infrared sighting...
ejection systems.
Ronald Collins didn't punch out
the night of the crash because he couldn't.
3.1%.
Is that what a man's life
is worth at SkyVionics?
He wasn't at the Tail Fin Bar
drinking the night before the crash.
He was out in the desert.
He was stargazing
with his son.
Why did you lie?
I, uh... I warned Matthews
about the chip...
but he said the ratio
was acceptable.
"3.1 is nothing
against the bottom line."
Is that why you doctored
the voice recorder?
Yeah.
Matthews wanted to keep
Gant out of the loop.
He said we'd all be raking it in
once he closed the commercial contracts.
[Scoffs]
<i>Jarod.</i>
<i>Put yourself in my shoes.</i>
I already have.
[No Audible Dialogue]
Who is that man?
It's no one, Jarod. It's no one.
- <i>[Beeps]</i>
- Answer the question, Sydney.
Who is he?
And what does he know about my father?
Sydney, I'm not here.
I'm glad we can
finally talk again.
The plane crash is
"not exactly a lie."
What did he mean by that?
I only know him as Mr. Raines.
But listen, Jarod.
I've been searching here...
<i>and I've discovered one thing.</i>
Your father was an aviator.
An aviator who had flown with...
- Jarod? Jarod!
- Sydney?
Sydney? Sydney!
Sydney.
Damn.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Well, somebody inside cut us off.</i>
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>That's right.</i>
Come with me.
Lieutenant Gant,
it's Jarod Wright.
There's something
that you really should see.
Uniforms-R-Us?
I need a rush job.
I thought we had
an understanding.
And now... this.
Well, he talked me into it.
He forced me.
He's not that good.
I can make it up to you.
And how do you propose
to do that?
Jarod's transmission used an old ARPA connection
from the early Internet days...
when it was still
a Defense Department system.
I've zeroed in
on his location.
- It's a beginning.
- [Coughs]
- Lieutenant.
- Sir. We should be starting
in about 30 minutes, sir.
Good. Been waiting six years
for this Scimitar system to impress us.
- Better be now.
- Trust me, sir. After what I saw last night...
it's gonna be
a real eye-opener.
<i>[Matthews]</i>
<i>What do you mean you can't find Dixon?</i>
I'm sorry, sir. There's no answer at his home.
He's probably on his way.
All right. You tell control
to confirm that all systems are on line.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- And call Dixon's house again.
[Hissing]
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
<i>[Ringing Continues]</i>
[Line Ringing]
Nothing.
[Jarod]
The natives must be getting restless.
You up for a dogfight?
Me? I was born for this moment.
[Matthews On Radio]
All right. You know the drill.
[Jarod]
Just like we practiced.
Don't break Mach 1.
Don't get fancy.
We'll be open-miked
into the tower, so remember...
we're on the air,
and everything's on the line.
I wouldn't have it
any other way.
<i>All right. Here we go.</i>
Scimitar 2, why don't you
make like a bandit?
Roger that, Manhunter.
<i>[Matthews Over Speaker]</i>
<i>First stop, radar reflection.</i>
<i>Scimitar's advanced avionics</i>
<i>will enable Eagle's R. W. R...</i>
<i>to initiate lockup twice as fast</i>
<i>as competitive systems.</i>
<i>As he evades,</i>
<i>Scimitar will predict his angle off-tail...</i>
<i>and lock on a real missile.</i>
<i>In the air, speed is life,</i>
<i>and Scimitar is speed.</i>
- [Beeping]
- Bang.
- <i>You're dead, Eagle.</i>
- I always wondered what that felt like.
- <i>[Matthews] Okay.</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Let's try this again.</i>
<i>Mach 1.8.</i>
<i>Let's really test the system.</i>
Roger that.
<i>[Beeping]</i>
<i>[Matthews]Jarod, we're off the speaker.</i>
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>
- <i>You want to look good in front</i>
<i>of the brass, don't ya?</i>
- You follow my lead.
I really couldn't do that.
You see, there's a failure rate
of 3.1% on any promise I make.
Ronald Collins wasn't so lucky.
<i>Come and get me, Manhunter.</i>
All right, General.
Watch and learn.
Sir.
- What the devil is this all about?
- The truth, General.
[Beeping]
I've lost flight control.
<i>[Matthews]</i>
<i>Eagle, repeat:</i>
I've lost flight control.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>That's because your Scimitar chip has failed.</i>
<i>Just like the one</i>
<i>in Ronald Collins's plane.</i>
Scary, isn't it, Tom?
I can't punch out!
I can't punch out!
<i>I'll tell you how</i>...
<i>if you tell me the truth.</i>
What the hell
are you talking about?
Well, then you're gonna suffer
the same fate as Ronald Collins.
<i>Do you copy, Manhunter?</i>
I had to make good
on the quarter!
You killed a good man,
and then you blamed it on him.
I didn't want that to happen!
I'm sorry!
<i>He was a friend of mine.</i>
<i>I didn't want that to happen. Get me out ofhere.!</i>

What's that?
It's in Delaware.
Blue Cove.
A place called the Centre.
Now, that's the only map
you're ever gonna find it on.
It's a dangerous place. People should be
made aware, if you know what I mean.
Oh, yeah.
This is real ripe.
I'll spread the word.
I'm counting on it.
- Good luck.

Uh, Jarod.

Gave the chip to the waitress.
Where's she going?
Forget the courier.
Focus on the chip.
Because it and dozens like it...
are on their way
to your security chief's mace holster.
- Mr. Morgan...
- <i>[Morgan] Remove it.</i>
I've worked here for ten years.
- All of a sudden some jerk in a shiny suit...
- Help him.
That's over $10,000.
Get him outta here.
It's not gonna stop here.
- A casino... it's always a target.
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
So, Mr. Felson...
what do you want?
Five percent of what you <i>don't</i> lose
while I'm in charge.
Don't you little ladies forget...
come see my show tonight.
There's no cover, no minimum,
and there's free <i>hot</i> hors d'oeuvres.
- [Ladies Giggling]
- I'll see y'all later. Bye-bye.
Thank you very much.
Hey there, teddy bear.
You come to rub elbows
with the king of rock and roll?
No. I'm trying to understand this.
You dress up in a rented costume
and pretend to be a dead singer?
"Singer"? Son, do you have
any idea who I am?
- Well, actually, I would assu...
- You are looking at a national monument.
Mount Rushmore
in blue suede shoes.
<i>There's not a human being</i>
<i>on God's green Earth...</i>
that has ever demanded
the attention and respect...
of the man you are lookin' at
this very moment.
Hey, Bernie, some guy at the craps table says
he'll give you five bucks to goose his wife.
I'll be right there.
Well, my fans beckon.
I must go.
Thank you very much.
That is the last of them.
I've run every one of these
through the mainframe...
and I can still find
no correlation.
Although there is something
to be said forJarod's theory...
<i>on the aerodynamics</i>
<i>of a 50-cent piece.</i>
Heads.
Okay.
Jarod is trying
to tell me something...
and this book is the clue.
That's a hell of a clue, Syd.
Jarod highlighted the entire book.
<i>But look at this page of statistics.</i>
He traced over
all the number eights.
<i>Now, eight is Jarod's favorite number.</i>
His favorite figure.
He calls it upright infinity...
because of the way one loop
coils into the next, never ending.
Maybe your Boy Wonder
has turned into Brian Boitano.
Mm-mmm.
<i>Jarod is looking</i>
<i>for a purpose.</i>
He's playing games.
Games?
<i>Games with numbers?</i>
<i>High-stakes games?</i>
<i>High-stakes poker.</i>
Baccarat.
Well, that narrows it down...
to any of the thousands
of gaming establishments on the planet.
Any ideas where to start?
I know just the man to see.
Hello.
Have you read this?
It's... It's very good.
It's about this inquisitive
little monkey named George.
He was <i>curious.</i>
<i>I've only read it</i>
<i>about a thousand times.</i>
Oh, well, good.
Then maybe you can help me.
Who is the man
in the yellow hat?
I don't know.
- Oh, well. Thank you anyway.
- Okay!
Can I help you?
Jarod.
It's about time.
- Hanlon's been asking for you.
- Asking for me?
Exposing Davis's scam saved him more money
than his creative accountant ever did.
Steve Hanlon, Jarod Felson.
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
I want to thank you
for helping us out.
<i>Here at the Marquis,</i>
<i>we think of ourselves as family.</i>
Nothing worse than being
betrayed by those close to you.
<i>Truly impressive, the way</i>
<i>you came in and cleaned house.</i>
<i>I guess the only question</i>
<i>I have... is why?</i>
<i>Why would a man I never heard of,</i>
<i>never laid eyes on...</i>
step in to help my business
out of the blue like that?
I'm a fan, Mr. Hanlon.
<i>You took a no-name video store.</i>
<i>You turned it into an empire.</i>
You listen to people.
You give them what they want. I like that.
You study people too.
Master your space.
My lecture at Brownstone.
- That must have been 12 years ago.
- <i>It was 11.</i>
And it was the first time you used
"Family First" as the company motto.
- <i>You were there?</i>
- <i>No, sir.</i>
But I bought the cassette.
I wore out my tape player.
<i>Peter, watch out.</i>
<i>I might steal this man for corporate.</i>
[Laughs]
Well, thank you, sir.
We finally got corruption
out of the Marquis.
I would like to help
keep it that way.
Jarod, you have my permission
to do whatever it takes.
I thank you, sir.
Jarod, this is my wife, Kitty.
Kitty, Jarod Felson,
our new security chief.
- <i>Nice to meet you.</i>
- A pleasure, Mr. Felson.
I saw your picture in the lobby.
Kitty used to
headline the show here.
Uh, I need to steal
Mr. Hanlon for a moment.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Felson.
- Nice to meet you.
So, you're a company man, huh?
I agree with Mr. Hanlon's theories on family,
if that's what you mean.
The only thing Hanlon likes about family
is the procreating part.
He spends millions
building this playground...
and proclaims families now have
a reason to vacation together.
And you don't think they do?
At a casino?
Jarod, people who never even dreamed of
gambling now think it's sanctioned by God.
Add a few flashy arcades,
even the damn kids go home broke.
Don't let Hanlon fool you.
He may talk the new corporate attitude
in this town...
deep down, he's still old Vegas.
[Monitor Beeping]
I'm sorry it took me
so long to get here, Maggie.

<i>Visiting hours</i>

<i>Dr. Ryan to O.R.</i>
I thought she was all alone.
Well...
she's not alone anymore.
<i>No offense, uh</i>...
She isn't going to wake up.
I know.
But it doesn't mean she can't hear me.
My name's Jarod.
Oh.
Name's Buddy.
Nice to meet you.
- Buddy.
- Hmm?
If-lf anything happens to her,
will you page me?
I didn't mean to...
sound cold before, but...
I've learned not to
get too attached.
But it is nice to know...
someone gives a damn.
<i>[Door Closes]</i>
[Tires Screeching]
Miss Parker,
what are we doing here?
Saying hello to an old friend.
Hey, I know you're excited to see me.
Just keep it in your pants, Vito.
Sydney, say hello toJohnny.
Johnny's brother hacked
into the computer profiles...
at one of our satellite companies
in Chicago.
- <i>Now he's serving 10 hard in Joliet.</i>
- What do you want?
<i>He's working a con in a casino.</i>
This face? He's not a con.
He's not the type.
He is <i>every</i> type.
<i>Find him for me.</i>
- Pass.
- Mmm. Not an option.
Because, you know,
I heard that at 3:00 tomorrow...
you're shipping out a boatload of...
[Whispering] stolen cars to Venezuela.
Now if you don't want the Port Authority
all over your little boat, well...
- You wouldn't.
- Wanna bet?
Fifty thousand for information.
No questions asked.
- <i>[Applause]</i>
- [Sighs]
<i>[Emcee]</i>
<i>Thanks, ladies and gentlemen.</i>
<i>You've been</i>
<i>a terrific audience tonight.</i>
Hey.
<i>If you're not staying at our fabulous hotel,</i>
<i>please drive safely.</i>
<i>Well, welcome</i>
<i>to the Heartbreak Hotel.</i>
What are you doing here?
You should be on stage.
Oh, no.
There's no more stage for the King.
The casino fired me.
I'm sorry.
Did it have something to do
with that bird thing?
- Bird thing?
- The... goose.
[Snickers]
No. No, they said they had had
complaints about the show.
<i>So I put on 20, 30 pounds.</i>
You think it's easy
being the idol of millions?
- I would guess no.
- <i>You're damn right it isn't.</i>
I sacrificed everything.
I did it 'cause I loved it.
It's what the people wanted.
<i>I just wish some of those casino bigwigs</i>
<i>could spend one hour...</i>
wearing the cape...
just one hour.
They'd walk away singing a different tune,
I guaran-damn-tee you.
Well, couldn't you get a job
at another casino?
No. No, buddy boy.
After 24 years
of making people smile...
singing the songs and...
spreading the good vibrations...
I'm afraid it's the end of the line
for the King.
<i>No, we</i>... <i>we had one hell</i>
<i>of a ride though. Didn't we?</i>
I bet you did.
Look, l... I'm sorry.
I'm spilling my guts,
and I don't even know your name.
Jarod.
<i>Felson.</i>
Bernie Baxley.
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Bernie Baxley.
Thanks.
Jarod?
I'm scared.
Of what?
Him.
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>
- Sydney.
- Hello, Sydney.
<i>Jarod.</i>
<i>Good to hear from you.</i>
It's been a while.
Where are you calling from?
You'll figure that out
sooner or later.
- I'm counting on later.
- Counting on or <i>betting</i> on?
You are so well read.
You know, it's such a pleasure to have
the freedom to read whatever I want these days.
Why the games, Jarod?
It's in the mail.
Jarod?
[Dial Tone]
[Imitating Monkey Hooting]
<i>[Jarod] I'm having trouble</i>
<i>understanding the account totals from July.</i>
Guy even works on his day off.
You pay me
to locate discrepancies...
and I can't reconcile
the figures against last year...
specificallyJuly.
- Just set it aside.
- Set it aside?
Jarod, there's a reason
those numbers don't match.
One of our showgirls
was attacked in the parking garage.
Our revenue dropped 30% for three days.
It was an anomaly.
<i>[Morgan]</i>
<i>Not to mention a publicity nightmare.</i>
Fortunately, the megabuster jackpot
hit two days later...
<i>and everybody came back.</i>
Sometimes Lady Luck
even smiles on the house.
<i>[Hanlon Chuckling]</i>
<i>[Ivy]</i>
<i>Thanks for the escort, Mr. Felson.</i>
None of us walk alone anymore.
Not since Maggie.
Maggie.
She was the woman that was attacked.
- Right.
- You knew her?
Well, I'd seen her in the show and around...
backstage, you know.
I read in the paper
there was no evidence of a robbery.
No.
The night it happened,
the showroom was completely packed.
It was the Fourth ofJuly.
Maggie was so happy.
She'd just landed the lead
in a big show in Atlantic City.
Maggie was leaving town?
Yeah, I guess so.
I know I would.
God, it happened right here.
- Gardenias.
- Excuse me?
Uh, Maggie always wore
a gardenia in her hair.
<i>I know it sounds strange, but...</i>
every time I pass this spot,
I swear I can smell gardenias.
- Listen, thanks.
- Sure.
- Drive safe.
- Thank you.
[Engine Starts]
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>This is weird, Sydney.</i>
<i>This doesn't make sense.</i>
I made it inside.
She doesn't hear me.
<i>The hallway's dark.</i>
<i>It smells like...</i>
flowers.
I round a corner.
To where?
The kitchen.
I'm getting closer.
I know they made her do things
that she didn't want to do.
Did she do something wrong?
Keep going, Jarod. Now focus
on the killer and not the victim.
Is the woman on the bed
her old self or her new self?
They are the same person.
She doesn't think so.
[Sydney] You have what you need
to complete the simulation.
[Young Jarod]
But I don't know why he's there.
Is he trying to kill Norma Jean
or Marilyn?
I'm confused.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Finish the simulation.</i>
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>Itjust seems so unfair.</i>
No one should have to die alone.
Something's wrong
with this picture.
Something's wrong
with this picture too, Sydney.
Somebody's luck just ran out.
[Bell Dings]
- Thanks for the escort, Mr. Felson.
- It was my pleasure.
Now, you're absolutely sure that you don't
know who this man in the yellow hat was?
Sorry.
- My car's right here.
- Well, have a good night.
Thanks.
This was just delivered.
Come on, Sydney.
We have a plane to catch.
Packin' up, huh?
Gotta stay mobile, son.
You know, I was thinkin'
about headin' back east.
You know, try Branson.
Vegas has changed, you know.
Not much in a city like this
for an old dog like me.
Thanks.
Oh, <i>that...</i>
is an official piece...
of Graceland memorabilia.
- Well, it's very nice.
- [Sighs]
Oh, kid, you know...
you should see the house
in person.
It's, uh... The King
named it for his mama.
People talk about how Elvis let himself go
there near the end...
<i>how he stopped caring</i>
<i>about the people, about the music.</i>
To me, it was just the opposite.
- The opposite?
- <i>Yeah.</i>
He cared too much.
He ran so fast...
so quick...
he didn't have anything left
to finish the race.
Too bad I won't be able
to finish it for him.
You never know, Bernie.
Sometimes a change of scenery
can do you good.
Maybe.
<i>[Pager Beeping]</i>
[Monitor Beeping]
It's okay, Maggie.
You're not alone.
[Monitor: Sustained Tone]
<i>[Monitor Clicks Off]</i>
So, where is he?
So, where is he?
It's a hundred grand.
- That was not the arrangement.
- <i>Actually, Sydney, it was.</i>
Your boy is in
the Marquis Casino in Vegas.
It's always a pleasure
taking white collar to the cleaners.
<i>[Miss Parker Chuckles]</i>
I know what you mean.
I brought 200,000 with me.
Who knew you'd be such a cheap date?
Come on, Syd.
We're going to Las Vegas...
a place where
maybe even you could get lucky.
[Line Rings]
[Woman] Hospital Administration.
Can you hold, please?
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Uh, yes, I'll hold.</i>
Yes, I would like to arrange
to pay Maggie Blaire's hospital bills.
They have?
Could you tell me by whom?
- Thank you.
- [Line Disconnects]
I thought you'd come.
I wanted to pay my respects.
Just like you paid
for Maggie's hospital bills...
and for this funeral?
You found the videotape, didn't you?
What?
The real security tape
from the night of the attack.
The one that Peter made sure
the police never saw.
It shows Maggie leaving the Marquis
with your husband.
- They were having an affair, weren't they?
- Who are you?
Somebody who doesn't believe
that Maggie deserved her fate.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
You don't have to pretend
like it's not happening anymore.
You don't understand.
He doesn't mean to hurt me.
Yes, he does.
This is your husband's rap sheet.
You're not the first person
that he's hurt.
And unless he's stopped, Maggie's
not gonna be the last person he kills.
My God.
Kitty... I'm here
because I want to help you.
I can stop him...
if you help me.
No. No, l... I can't do that.
When I told him that Maggie was dead
and that I knew what had happened...
h-he lost it.
He said he'd kill me
if I told anyone.
And then he just hit me
again... and again...
[Sobbing]
and again.
Why did he stop?
The phone rang.
Kitty, one day
the phone's not gonna ring.
Mr. Hanlon.
Jarod Felson.
I've discovered a serious problem...
and I'd like to discuss it with you
one-on-one.
Say tomorrow morning,
around 10:00?
Ivy, it's Mr. Felson.
I was wondering if you
could do me a favor.
[Speaking German]
- Hello?
- Peter.
Jarod Felson.
Jarod. What's up?
I've discovered
an even larger problem than before.
- Is it Davis again?
- No.
But it's big,
something you need to handle...
personally.
Can you meet me tomorrow morning,
around 10:00?
Absolutely.
I'll see you there.
So, what are you,
about a 38?
- What?
- Waist.
Uh, 30... 36.
<i>Seńor</i>Jarod,
five nights and you don't sleep.
- [Chuckles]
- Hmm?
Too much to do, Blanca.
Not enough hours in the day.
Jorge!
- <i>żHas leído este libro?</i>
- <i>Si.</i>
<i>Mucho.</i>
<i>Tengo cinco nińos.</i>
<i>ˇBlanca, peryecto.!</i>
<i>żQuién es el hombre</i>
<i>en el sombrero amarillo?</i>
Mmm.
<i>No sé, seńor.</i>
- <i>No sé.</i>
- [Sighs] <i>Gracias.</i>
żBlanca?
<i>żSí?</i>
Would you do me a favor?
- Peter, come on. We don't have much time.
- What's this about?
It's about a hundred grand walking out
of this casino right under your very nose.
<i>Mr. Hanlon.!</i>
<i>From Jarod Felson.</i>
He said he'd meet you in the security bay
as soon as he can.
<i>[Jarod] Somebody has been</i>
<i>double-counting the cash outlays.</i>
Based on my findings, over a hundred grand
is being skimmed off the top...
every Tuesday cash pickup.
- You think Davis was behind this?
- I'm not sure.
But it's bigger than one guy.
An accounting scam
tied into the armored car courier.
For every $300,000
that's deposited on paper...
another hundred grand
is being dropped off at a second locale.
But if we keep this scam going...
we find out where the locale is...
we can bring down everybody
that's been ripping off the Marquis.
Why don't we just
bring in the cops?
Peter, think about this.
If you pull this off...
you are gonna be Steve Hanlon's
$20 million hero.
- The Marquis. Now.
- Yes, ma'am.
Why me?
I'm the new face around here.
Nobody's gonna trust me.
But if their courier is greeted
by the president of the casino...
he's gonna play
right into your hands.
It's showtime.
Where's Mr. Davis?
[Clears Throat] Mr. Davis worked for me
in more ways than one.
I'm Peter Morgan.
I run the Marquis.
It's business as usual.
You understand?
Sure.
Business as usual.
Take the skim to the drop.
Deposit the rest in the bank.
- We'll see you next Tuesday.
- Okay.
[Imitates Elvis Presley]
Well, thank you very much.
That was exciting!
Guy fell for everything I said.
He must be a complete idiot.
[Sighs]
Find him.
[Chuckling]
<i>[Morgan]</i>
<i>Steve.!</i>
- I didn't think you'd be here.
- Surprise.
- You won't believe what I've been doing.
- Bet me.
Business as usual.
Take the skim to the drop. Deposit the rest
in the bank. We'll see you next Tuesday.
<i>[Bernie]</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
Steve, I wasn't really
taking the money. We were...
There's a great deal of unreported cash
leaving this casino.
I know!
And, uh, we were...
And a great deal of cash
is going in your Swiss bank account.
- I don't have a Swiss account.
- Oh.
<i>Electronic transfers...</i>
for $4.6 million.
That is your signature, isn't it?
I didn't do this.
Tell him.
Tell him the truth.
I am sorry, Mr. Hanlon.
I'm sorry
I didn't catch this sooner.
<i>And the figure is closer to 4.8.</i>
Every instinct in my gut
told me you were bad news.
Steve, I didn't do anything wrong...
[Groans, Panting]
Felson, damn it!
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>
I didn't do anything wrong.
Neither did Maggie Blaire.
<i>Detective Benson,</i>
<i>Homicide.</i>
- I'm looking for a Peter Morgan.
- He's in a meeting right now.

<i>[Approaching Footsteps Running]</i>
<i>We got your radio call, Mr. Felson.</i>
<i>Is there a problem?</i>
Yes, there is.
A couple of grifters
trying a roulette scam.
<i>Call the L. V.P.D.</i>
<i>and have them picked up.</i>
Let go of me.
You might want to strip-search this one.
She could be palming chips.
Oh, you bastard!

- I will get you.
- You wanna bet?
<i>Tails.</i>

<i>Not a paper clip.</i>
<i>No trash, no lint.</i>

- What line?
- Well, don't you think
we should wait for Miss Parker?
- We'll do it without her.
- Sydney, she's gonna kill me.
- What line?
- Okay, two.
But keep him on as long as you can.
I've already initiated a trace.

<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Hello, Jarod?</i>
- I had the dream again.
- Are you all right?
Keep talking to him.
We almost got him.
- [Loud Whistling Over Phone]
- Tell Broots I discovered Radio Shack.
Strange.
Feeling homesick.
Only I don't know
where home is.
Your home's here, Jarod.
You were never meant
for the outside world.
Spare me the white-leopard
speech, Sydney.
Somebody at the Centre
knows who I am.
- I want the truth.
- I'm sure we can explore...
these questions if you come back
and resume our work.
I wish I could believe you.
What you believe or don't believe
is not the issue.
- What is?
- Those digital simulations you stole.
They contain the only
existing record...
of over 25 years of research.
The Centre...
I want them back.
Well, then perhaps they...
you... would consider a trade.
A piece of my past

Get back to me, Sydney.

- Late for what?
- Justice.

- But you dress like a woman.
- Didn't anybody tell you?
- No.
Listen. I know you don't know me,
and I'll admit I'm a little different.
But if you don't help me, they're gonna put me
away faster than you can say Chanel No. 5.
<i>I didn't do anything wrong.</i>
<i>Those men were trying to kill me.</i>
I just defended myself.
You walk out on me,
I'm a dead man.
- Don't worry, Mr. Dexter.
- <i>[Patting Shoulder]</i>
I'll stand up with you.
Thank you.
I knew you were a good man.

- About seven minutes.
Oh.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
[Indistinct]
<i>Jarod, please, join us.</i>
<i>We wanted to be the first to congratulate you</i>
<i>on your victory in court this morning.</i>
- It was beginner's luck.
- <i>We heard your client was quite a looker.</i>
Just how lucky did you get?
<i>Don't let Bradley</i>
<i>get under your skin.</i>
All junior associates get thrown
a ringer their first time out.
There's honor in keeping
poor, innocent men out of jail.
- Even if they do wear chiffon.
- <i>Excuse me.</i>
- Mr. Dumont, Michael Metzger's
waiting in reception.
- <i>Thanks, Annie.</i>
Thankfully, a client
who's neither poor nor innocent.
Speaking of poor, innocent men...
<i>have you finished your brief</i>
<i>on the Whittaker appeal?</i>
<i>Ben, I'm spending 70 hours</i>
<i>a week on the Metzger merger.</i>
My plate is full.
Dumont is a pit bull in the court,
but sometimes forgets...
who signs his paychecks.
[Chuckles]
All right, I'll take care of it.
Oh, Jarod, in case
you're interested...
Collins department store is having
a two-for-one sale on the lingerie section.
- See ya, tiger.
- Jarod, keep up the good work.
- <i>I'll do my best, sir.</i>
- Annie...
<i>there's something</i>
<i>I want you to do.</i>
- Brad, may I speak to you for a moment?
- It was a joke.
I understand that.
I wanted to ask you some questions...
about the Whittaker trial.
Old Man Sloane lost a murder defense
a few years ago...
and I got stuck holding the bag.
Why would Sloane tie up
his best trial attorney...
writing an appeal that could be handled
by a first-year law student?
The Whittaker case is
a raw nerve with Sloane.
- He hates to lose.
- Let me write the appeal.
<i>You said your plate is full.</i>
And I could use the practice.
The old man will have my head if he finds out
I dumped this on a junior associate.
I can keep a secret
if you can.
Let's talk.
You find Dumont for me now,
or I'm gonna find him myself.
<i>Base it on my previous appeals</i>
<i>and keep me in the loop.</i>
- You're the boss.
- Not yet, but I'm working on it.
Mr. Metzger. I just got
off the phone with the judge.
I think everything's gonna work out
just the way you want it.
- Good.
- Have you lost weight?
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Madam Director...</i>
allJarod wants is some
small piece of himself, of his past.
I believe if we can
accept his trade offer...
it would go a long way
towards reestablishing...
the kind of trust I need
to bring him back.
What about S.I.S.?
Well, Miss Parker believes she can pistol-whip
her way into any resolution.
But I know Jarod.
The harder we chase...
the harder he'll run.
I'll discuss your proposal
with the Tower.
But I make no promises.
Oh, damn.
The idea is to get all the same colors
on the same side?
[Scoffs]
Where were you during the '80s?
I led a very isolated life.
When did you quit smoking?
How did you know that?
Oh, your trembling hands...
<i>nicotine stains on your fingertips,</i>
<i>irritability.</i>
You know, you can try
a simple Epsom salt bath.
The salt, it draws the tar and nicotine
out of the bloodstream through the skin.
So, you're a doctor and a lawyer?
- And I'm working on Indian chief.
- Annie.
Would you please transcribe, proof and
hand-deliver these to my boat tonight?
Tonight? Oh, no, no, no.
Mr. Sloane, I can't, because my daughter...
Is a very lovely girl who knows
how valuable her mother is to this firm.
<i>Annie's the best, Jarod.</i>
Annie do this.
Annie do that.
I'll tell you... it's like being Sloane's wife
without the fringe benefits.
<i>Too bad paychecks are harder</i>
<i>to quit than cigarettes.</i>
So, did you need something too?
Actually, Bradley Dumont
asked me to go over an old case file.
Marcus Whittaker?
Oh, yeah. Mr. Sloane had those files
moved down to the basement.
But I'm gonna warn you. It is impossible
to find anything down there.
Nothing's impossible.
<i>Jarod.</i>
Isaac, what are you doing here?
I got to thinking how nice you were,
how decent.
- And I wanted to repay your kindness.
- Repay?
- <i>My chariot.</i>
- <i>Isaac.!</i>
- It's beautiful.
- [Chuckles]
It'll be more beautiful
after 37 payments.
That's when I plan to trade it in
for a limousine.
Actually, I offer
a very valuable service.
You'd be surprised how many cabdrivers
won't pick up a man in a dress.
Really? Why?
The truth is,
I'd like to offer my services...
as your personal chauffeur.
No kidding!
Well, that's great.
- Now, you sure you have a driver's license?
- Don't worry, boss.
You're in good hands.
And I promise to be
the perfect lady.
- <i>[Horn Honking]</i>
- <i>[Man Laughing] Hey, baby.!</i>
- Up yours, pal!
- <i>[Tires Screeching]</i>
[Computer Rings]
Very good.
<i>Sydney, a word?</i>
- Do you wanna tell me what's going on?
- <i>Nothing, really.</i>
An alpha brain wave experiment.
- <i>Quite promising, actually.</i>
- That's not what I mean, and you know it.
You spoke to the director?
Answer the question!
- Jarod wants to make a deal.
- A deal.
He wants to find out the truth
or part of it.
<i>It is the humane thing to do.</i>
You are out of line lecturing anybody
about humanity.
I'm not the one who kept
Jarod locked up for 30 years.
<i>I'm killing your deal, Sydney.</i>
And then I'm gonna find Jarod.
And I'm gonna end this thing
once and for all.
Everybody's a critic.
<i>[Blues]</i>
Doesn't this music just give you chills
up and down your spine?
It's very... sad.
It's the blues, baby.
The blues.
- I like it.
- It's about life...
about pain...
it's about truth.
- Truth is good.
- Yeah. Look at me, for example.
I come out here every day
like a target.
And I say to the world,
"Ha!
This is me.
Take it or leave it."
- Can I ask you a question?
- Why do I dress like this?
Well, it does seem
to draw attention.
I don't know why I do it.
I just know it's right for me.
I mean, I grew up like
everybody else.
I played football,
dated a cheerleader.
But I never felt complete
until I found this.
<i>It hasn't been easy, though.</i>
- Why do it then?
- <i>It's who I am.</i>
People can't go around acting like
they're something they aren't.
You do that long enough, and pretty soon
you can't find yourself anymore.
Know what I mean?
Yeah.
So, who we lookin' for?
<i>[Buzzer Sounding]</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>His name is Marcus Whittaker.</i>
- Friend of yours?
- Not exactly.
<i>[Isaac]</i>
<i>What'd he do?</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Nothing.</i>
Nothing at all.
The Tower has considered all the variables and
has decided to move forward with the deal.
- You can't be serious.
- I think you know that I am.
The chairman is going
to hear about this.
Your father cast
the deciding vote.
<i>The information Jarod requested</i>
<i>will be on your desk within the hour.</i>
- <i>Use it wisely.</i>
- <i>[Elevator Bell Dings]</i>
- [Sydney] You'll only have one
shot at the terrorist, Jarod.
- I had the dream again.
It's just a dream, Jarod.
Forget about it and concentrate.
Is it possible...
to forget who you are
and where you came from?
Jarod, please.
It's just that in this dream,
I can't see my mother's face.
She's in the yard hanging wash.
One shot, Jarod.
Time's running out.
The hostages are counting on you.
But I wanna see her, Sydney.
I wanna see my mother's face!
Finish the simulation
and I'll see to it that you do.
- Promise?
- Promise.
Wait. I can't
complete the mission.
I might hit a hostage.
- I might kill an innocent person.
- Sometimes, Jarod...
<i>one life must be sacrificed</i>
<i>in order to save others.</i>

[Woman Reporter]
Murder suspect Marcus Whittaker...
accused of beating Audrey Price
to death in her apartment...
was arrested in the early morning hours
in his janitor quarters...
of this West L.A.
apartment building.
Marcus Whittaker has
an unusual benefactor in this case...
his employer, real estate magnate
Michael Metzger...
whose company owns the building
in which the murder took place.
How long we gonna stay here?
Hello?
<i>Audrey Price's death</i>
<i>is a tragedy.</i>
But Marcus Whittaker shouldn't
be forced to take the rap...
for the sloppy handling
of this investigation.
I'm just grateful that Ben Sloane
has agreed to represent Marcus.
Mr. Metzger was with me on my boat
when word reached him...
that a murder had taken place
on one of his properties.
Naturally, I offered my services.
Isaac, let's go shopping.
Whoo! Now you're talking
my language.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>It's creepy.</i>
He's been doing that
for almost an hour.
Check out his girlfriend.
- Are these all the boat shoes you have?
- Yes, sir.
I'll take them all.
You want seven pairs
of boat shoes?
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you carry these in a 13?
<i>[Knocking]</i>
Well?
I did it. Just like you said.
And?
I dragged it around
behind my bike.
- Excellent.
- [Scoffs]
Oh, yes, right.
Five dollars.
That's right.
I have friends. We could really mess up
your car if you're interested.
I'll let you know.
Cool.
Mr. Whittaker is the only
possible perpetrator.
The defense has no relevant evidence
to the contrary.
<i>You're wrong, Mr. Edwards.</i>
<i>[Edwards]</i>
<i>Thank you. Enjoy the book.</i>
My God. What did you do,
drag this behind a car?
Well, actually, I paid a kid
to drag it behind his bike.
- Truthfully, it's been like a bible to me.
- Well, I'm flattered.
- Whom should I make this out to?
- John Corey, Jr.
I knew a John Corey
at Dartmouth. You're not...
Guilty. Dad's been after me
to look you up for years.
<i>So there's your father wearing nothing but</i>
<i>a drunken grin running up the dorm hallway...</i>
shouting, "Banzai!"
- Dear old Dad.
- Yeah.
I never saw a better litigator
in my life.
He said the same thing
about you.
I especially admired the way you brought
down Ben Sloane a few years ago.
- <i>The Whittaker trial?</i>
- Oh. Sloane had no case.
Really? What about
the shoe print?
- How'd you know about that?
- <i>I did a paper...</i>
<i>the People vs. Whittaker,</i> at UCLA.
I read the case files.
- 5,000 pages?
- 5,612 to be exact.
Michael Metzger buys Whittaker
the most expensive lawyer in the city...
and the guy drops the ball.
- <i>We couldn't believe he missed it.</i>
- The D.A. knew about the print?
We provided it in discovery.
We kept waiting for Sloane
to play the card, to create doubt.
<i>But it never came.</i>
And you never said anything?
[Sighs]
We had witnesses...
<i>who said that Marcus Whittaker</i>
<i>was obsessed with Audrey Price.</i>
His prints were
all over the apartment.
<i>He was caught in his janitor's quarters</i>
<i>cleaning her blood offhis clothes.</i>
Now, you don't have to read Proust
to connect those dots.
Yet you never found
a murder weapon.
Marcus Whittaker
was guilty of murder.
<i>Ben Sloane was just guilty</i>
<i>ofbeing a bad lawyer.</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Mr. Sloane came to the police station.</i>
He was nice to me.
He brought me a ham sandwich.
What are you making?
Paper clocks.
A pen pal taught me.
They really work.
They'd be better with note cards.
The-The paper the guards give me
gets all soft.
- Would these do?
- Can I have those?
Sure.
Marcus, I wanna ask you
some questions about your case.
Mr. Sloane is my lawyer.
I know, but I'm here
to help him, and you.
Okay?
- Okay.
- <i>Can you tell me...</i>
why you ran away the night
that Audrey Price was killed?
I didn't wanna go to jail again.
You had gotten into some trouble when you
lived with your mother, is that correct?
Some boys were making fun of her.
<i>I had to fight 'em.</i>
I didn't wanna hurt anyone.
<i>I had to go live at Milltown.</i>
The detention facility.
Now I wanna ask you
about the night of the murder.
[Exhales]
I was bringing flowers
to Miss Price...
like I did every day.
<i>I was finishing up late.</i>
<i>She would always pay me</i>
<i>an extra two dollars for them.</i>
[Clears Throat]
But this time, when I walked in...
I saw her body on the floor.
Marcus? Marcus?
It's okay.
You don't have to be afraid.
She was all twisted up.
Her face was covered with blood.
The... The owl
was sitting beside her.
The owl?
Made of rock.
It was green.
Miss Price had
a whole family of them.
She kept them on top
of her coffee table.
<i>She looked so quiet.</i>
Like she was sleeping,
except for the blood.
- You liked her.
- She was nice to me.
The other lawyer said
I wanted to touch her...
but I just thought she was nice.
Did you ever notice her
having visitors?
<i>Boyfriends?</i>
Mr. Metzger would come visit her
at lunchtime almost every day.
- Mr. Metzger?
- Yeah.
He had a cool black car.
- It had real shiny wheels on it
and the top was gone.
- Marcus.
Did you ever tell Mr. Sloane or the police
about Mr. Metzger's visits?
Oh, Mr. Sloane said
that I shouldn't say nothing.
<i>It might not look good.</i>
Mr. Sloane always
looks out for me.
They really work.
- [Line Ringing]
- It's 9:20, and Michael Metzger
has just killed a woman.
- Who does he call?
- You've reached Benjamin Sloane at the marina.
I wish I was on my boat right now, but I'm
probably in my office working to pay for it.
Leave your name and number
and I'll get back to you.
[Machine Beeps]
I don't understand. Why would
a defense lawyer like Mr. Sloane...
<i>put a poor, innocent man in jail?</i>
To keep a rich, guilty one out.
<i>[Clock Ticking]</i>
Hi, Jarod.
[Ringing]
Mom?
- <i>[Ringing Continues]</i>
- Mom?
Time's up, Sydney.
I need an answer.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Miss Parker's not happy.</i>
<i>In fact, she's removed herself</i>
<i>from this case...</i>
<i>because the Centre has agreed</i>
<i>to your request, Jarod.</i>
Your information in return
for the stolen disks.
They said that?
We... you and l...
have guarantees from the council chairman
and the director.
I'm sending it through now.
Hope this is what
you need, Jarod.
[Computer Rings]
Is this her, Sydney?
Is this my mother?
Yes, it is.
I'll-I'll meet you at the place
and time we agreed on earlier.
Mr. Sloane, is it true that your client
will not be testifying in his own defense?
Mr. Whittaker suffers
from a severe learning disability.
It was his feeling and mine that it was not
in his best interest to take the stand.
<i>[Reporter] Well, what is your assessment</i>
<i>of the prosecution's case so far?</i>
I think this deliberation doesn't
bode well for the prosecution...
especially in light of the fact that they still
haven't produced the murder weapon.
The murder weapon. The murder weapon.
Produced the murder weapon.
Yeah. I wonder why.
<i>[Knocking]</i>
Bradley, will you check my brief
for the Whittaker hearing?
I worked from your old appeal,
and I made a few notes.
- You what?
- I went over the old case file.
- There's some areas we should explore.
- No, there aren't!
Copy my draft! Change the date.
Stamp my signature on it.
Get it to the court by 5:00.
If you can't handle that,
I'll hire a monkey who can.
- Sure thing, Brad.
- [Whirring]
[Engine Not Turning Over]
Shoot. Damn it!
<i>[Car Door Closes]</i>
Don't fight it, brother.
At times like this,
a man's gotta believe in fate.
<i>Bad luck...</i>
meet good fortune.
<i>My chariot.</i>
<i>[Whittaker] I got a letter from my mom.</i>
<i>She's really sick. She shouldn't be alone.</i>
Don't worry, Marcus.
You're going to see your mother again soon.
I promise. But first,
we have to go to court...
one more time.
- Mr. Sloane will be there too.
- What do I have to do?
Trust me.
- <i>[Isaac] So, how was your lunch meeting?</i>
- <i>[Dumont Chuckles]</i>
Extremely profitable.
Arriving in this limo
didn't hurt negotiations either.
Excuse me. Um, sir, this isn't the way
back to the office.
It's such a fabulous day,
I thought we'd take a little <i>ride.</i>
- <i>[Chuckling]</i>
- A ride?
To... To where?
- [Laughing]
- <i>Hey.!</i>
<i>[Doors Locking]</i>
What the...
<i>In the matter of</i>
Beaumont vs. Markswatch...
Jarod.
I wanted to congratulate you
on the Whittaker appeal.
- <i>Dumont says that the new trial is a slam dunk.</i>
- New trial?
The court has accepted Dumont's motion
to present new evidence.
Evidence?
Yes, he's confident that he's gonna have
a warrant for the murder weapon by tomorrow.
He didn't tell you?
- <i>[Intercom Beeps]</i>
- Annie, where's Dumont?
<i>[Annie]</i>
<i>He's been out all afternoon.</i>
The last I heard, he was having lunch
with Ira Klein, the criminal attorney...
I know who he is!
Annie!
<i>[Muttering, Shouting]</i>
I wanna know
where the hell Dumont is!
<i>[Dumont]</i>
<i>Hey, pal, this is kidnapping.</i>
- <i>[Blues]</i>
- I'm a very successful attorney, you know.
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
That's gonna cost you another
hundred miles, Esquire. [Laughing]
<i>Whoo.!</i>
<i>[Sloane] Mr. Metzger was with me</i>
<i>on my boat when word reached</i>...
<i>Mr. Metzger was with me</i>
<i>on my boat when word reached</i>...
<i>[Voice Distorted]</i>
<i>With me on my boat.</i>
Hello. I would like to book
a nonstop flight to Los Angeles.
<i>[Sloane]</i>
<i>Tell the associates this is top priority.</i>
<i>[Keyboarding]</i>
Yes, I'd like the number
for the <i>Los Angeles Chronicle.</i>
The city desk, please.
<i>[Sloane] Annie, there's something</i>
<i>I want you to do for me.</i>
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
Hello?
Mr. Sloane.
Well, no, sir.
I was just listening to some
very interesting old recordings.
The hearing is tomorrow
at 9:00 a.m.?
Yes, sir, but shouldn't
we wait for Mr. Dumont?
Yes, sir. I understand.
I'll see you first thing
tomorrow morning.
Like clockwork.
<i>[Sloane] Annie, there's something</i>
<i>I want you to do for me.</i>
<i>Annie, top priority. There's something</i>
<i>I want you to do for me on my boat.</i>
[Tape Rewinding]
Annie, top priority. There's something
I want you to do for me on my boat.
<i>[Sloane]</i>
<i>Just watch, listen and learn, Jarod.</i>
You won't see this kind
of dismantling again soon.
I'm looking forward to it, sir.
What are the press doing here?
- [Reporters Clamoring]
- There's nothing I can say at this point in time.
But I will say that there's
going to be some surprises.
- The district courthouse.
- What the hell?
You didn't seriously think the Centre
would cut a deal with Jarod?
Double double cross, Syd.
It's just business.
Have a seat over there.
What the hell is he doing here?
I invited him.
<i>[Judge]</i>
<i>On the record in</i> People vs. Whittaker...
the court hearing a defense motion
to present new evidence.
Mr. Holmes.
<i>Your Honor, Mr. Holmes</i>
<i>is a junior associate in our firm.</i>
He doesn't represent
this particular client.
With all due respect, Your Honor,
I wrote the motion...
and I did the research
for this hearing.
To assign it to another attorney is to deny
Marcus Whittaker a chance at fair representation.
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- Trying to get an innocent man...
- <i>a fair shot atjustice.</i>
- That's enough.
<i>Mr. Whittaker, is there an attorney</i>
<i>you'd like to represent you?</i>
Jarod.
- Your Honor...
- It's over, Mr. Sloane.
Call your first witness, Mr. Holmes.
<i>Your Honor...</i>
the defense calls Benjamin Sloane.
- <i>[People Chattering]</i>
- <i>[Gavel Rapping]</i>
<i>Mr. Sloane, you represented Marcus Whittaker</i>
<i>to the very best of your ability.</i>
- Is that correct?
- Absolutely.
And to the best of your knowledge,
nothing slipped through the cracks?
- There are no cracks at Sloane and Associates.
- <i>Hmm.</i>
Would you explain your relationship
with Michael Metzger?
He's a client.
Were you aware that your client
was carrying on an affair...
with Audrey Price
at the time of the murder?
- Do you have any proof of that?
- Marcus Whittaker would gladly
testify to it under oath.
What's your point, Mr. Holmes?
Now you went through great pains
to establish the fact...
that Michael Metzger was a guest on your
boat at the time of the murder... is that correct?
I wouldn't call it "great pains."
He was there.
Do you remember what time
Audrey Price was killed?
- Between 9:00 and 9:15, if memory serves me.
- <i>Interesting.</i>
Then maybe you could tell me...
why Mr. Metzger made
a cell phone call to your boat...
at 9:20 the very same night
if he was with you.
May I see that, Mr. Holmes?
Proceed.
For the record, the D.A. has cataloged
this photo...
as a partial shoe print
from the murder scene.
Mr. Sloane, would you explain to the court
why the jury never saw this photograph?
<i>The police never made</i>
<i>a positive match.</i>
It proved nothing.
Well, perhaps I could help
the police out.
It's a size 11, deck shoe.
<i>You were on your boat that night,</i>
<i>weren't you, Mr. Sloane?</i>
- [Chuckles] So, now I'm the killer?
- <i>No.</i>
You were the janitor.
- We'll get to the killer.
- Your Honor, this is pointless harassment.
- <i>[Judge] Mr. Holmes.</i>
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
One moment, please.
- <i>[Annie] Mr. Sloane's on trial?</i>
- <i>Not officially.</i>
Not yet, anyway.
<i>[Banging Desk]</i>
<i>I love this part.</i>
A size 11 deck shoe...
from Mr. Sloane's closet.
- Proves nothing.
- <i>No.</i>
But this certainly does.
The murder weapon.
<i>Stained with the victim's blood.</i>
Mr. Sloane, would you care
to explain to the court...
what the long-lost murder weapon
was doing on your boat?
[Scoffs]
This is ridiculous.
I don't think that
Michael Metzger thinks so.
You've been blackmailing him
with this since the murder trial.
Michael Metzger beat
Audrey Price to death.
<i>And then he called upon</i>
<i>Mr. Sloane to clean up the mess.</i>
<i>Only before you got there,</i>
<i>Mr. Whittaker arrived.</i>
He found the victim.
He panicked.
He ran away.
You allowed an innocent man
to go to jail.
<i>If I've missed something,</i>
<i>feel free tojump in.</i>
<i>Your Honor, there hasn't been</i>
<i>a piece of evidence...</i>
presented here that a good
defense attorney couldn't shoot down.
Then I suggest
you find a very good one.
<i>I'm ordering you into custody</i>
<i>as an accessory to murder...</i>
<i>and issuing a bench warrant</i>
<i>for the arrest of Michael Metzger.</i>
- <i>Court adjourned.</i>
- <i>[Gavel Raps]</i>
I don't know what kind of law
you're practicing here.
The kind of law that applies
to millionaires too.
<i>Congratulations, Marcus.</i>
<i>You're a free man.</i>
Go, Sam.
We'll head him off downstairs.
- [Monitor Beeping]
- Hey, hold it right there!
You don't understand.
I have a permit to carry that.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Out of my way!
That way.
Jarod!
Damn it!
Next time I'm just gonna
shoot the little pain in the ass.
<i>[Horn Honking]</i>
<i>Get in the car.</i>
<i>[Engine Not Turning Over]</i>
Right this way, Mr. Metzger.
Look, I wanna see my attorney,
all right?
I said, I wanna see my attorney!
[Policeman]
You're in luck.
<i>[Gate Alarm Buzzing]</i>
[Woman]
Excuse me.
<i>[Whistling]</i>
Mom!
[Laughing]
How'd you get here?
A man sent me a ticket.
<i>[Mom]</i>
<i>What is it?</i>
It's a paper clock.
"Now you have all the time
in the world.
"Cherish your freedom, Marcus.
Your pen pal, Jarod."
Hold on to it now.
Right there.
- <i>You all right?</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Eight seconds?</i>
- That's it?
- Uh-huh.
- Eight seconds? Eight seconds?
- [Lowing]
- Let her rip.

<i>[Clicking]</i>
Why am I here, Sydney?
I want you to examine
some photographs.
Is he a warrior?
<i>[Young Sydney]</i>
<i>Yes, a soldier in Southeast Asia.</i>
Why do I have to look at him?
There are people who believe
this photograph was manufactured...
created.
I want to know what you think.
He's afraid...
sad.
He's missing.
The people who love him want
to know if he's still alive.
Like my parents?
<i>[Gunfire]</i>
<i>[Gunfire Continues]</i>
Why are you so interested in Mr. Starr?
[Miss Parker]
It's a family matter.
Could you describe his manner,
his mood, you know?
Uh, I tell you...
That ol' boy was multifaceted.
He walked in here, and he didn't know
a pickle barrel from a gun barrel.
And in less than 24 hours...
[Laughing]
he's doing this.
10:19.
They're all like this.
Damned if I know what it means.
- <i>Oh, and then there was the slugs.</i>
- What about the slugs?
<i>He paid extra to come in after hours</i>
<i>and dig 'em out the back wall.</i>
Said he wanted to study 'em.
He was real big on studyin' things.
<i>[Laughing]</i>
- Like I say, this ol' boy was multifaceted.
- Multifaceted.
<i>[Laughing]</i>
<i>Did he happen to say where he was going?</i>
He was staying at the lodge up near
the highway. You might check there.
- Thank you.
- Sure enough.
- Can I?
- Free country. Oh, hey!
<i>When you find him, give him his toy.</i>
His toy?
<i>Yeah. When he was through shooting,</i>
<i>he'd run that all around the place.</i>
<i>[Laughing]</i>
That ol' boy was just a big kid,
that's all. Funny, huh?
- Hysterical.
- Here.
[Whirring]
<i>[Siren Wailing]</i>
<i>[Siren Continues]</i>
[Siren Stops]
[Police Radio Chatter, Indistinct]
- Was I going too fast when I passed that truck?
- No, sir.
When you passed me.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>I want my lawyer. I got rights.!</i>
You better relax. You hear me?
Shut up and don't move.
- Want a beer or cappuccino or something?
- Ha-ha.
Let's see what we got here.
Oh, boy!
A bona fide three-time loser, Frankie.
We know what that means, don't we?
- Automatic jail time, isn't it?
- Congratulations.
Though it does seem a little harsh...
considering that you got only... what?
Six dollars and 37 cents
off an old lady.
You almost got away with it too.
You are what we call a top-notch criminal.
Where's my coffee, Frank?
<i>Run, you little puke.!</i>
- [Grunts]
- Ow!
Man, maybe I should've got him a decaf.
- That looked like it hurt.
- See what happens when you act like an idiot?
- Put the track star in his cage.
- Don't rip that pretty shirt.
- Slick move. Carl Bishop.
- How you doin'? Frank Meyers.
Jarod Starr. Two R's.
- Hey, like Ringo.
- Who's Ringo?
That's funny. How come I haven't
seen you around here before?
He just transferred in from Chicago.
You're late again today, and I'm still
waiting on those transfer papers.
- I was coming to talk to you...
- Bishop, Meyers, you two were due
in my office a half hour ago.
Yeah. Well, we've been kind of busy.
- I want you both inside now.
- <i>Detective, give us a break.</i>
<i>We've gone over this already.</i>
Now.
- That woman needs a hobby.
- She's just doing her job, Frank.
- We'll see you later, Chicago.
- Look forward to it.
<i>[Meyers]</i>
<i>Yeah, nice meeting you.</i>
- Did I miss something?
- Typical I.A. frost.
- She's Internal Affairs?
- Detective Karen Swindell.
Don't get any ideas, Romeo.
She's the original ice princess.
- You were saying something about transfer papers.
- Come on, Sarge.
You know how it is with red tape.
They should be along any day now.
Until I get the rest
of your documentation...
you're gonna be riding a desk
instead of a bike.
You don't want me to start thinking
you're up to something.
Me? Sarge, I'm clean as a whistle.
Get back to work.
- [Tires Screeching]
- [Horn Honking]
[Siren Wailing]
Can I help you, Officer?
Ma'am, did you, by any chance,
happen to notice the color...
Whoa! Is that a twin cam?
- Excuse me?
- You guys bore out the cylinder heads, don't you?
Man, I'd love to soup up my honeypot.
- Your honeypot?
- My hog.
I was goin' to blow out the headers
and open up the cylinder block...
but my Social Security check was late.
- <i>Millie.!</i>
- Hey, Mill! You're lookin' good!
Ride... you devils!
[Laughing]
Rode with those dudes in Jacksonville.
- Ma'am.
- Mildred Reynolds.
- Friends call me Millie.
- Millie.
Did you happen to notice the color
of the light back there in the intersection?
What light?
Wonder Boy checked out of
this dirt-water town three days ago.
That's all he left behind.
Where's the driver?
Using the facility.
- Guy has the bladder of a squirrel.
- [Siren Chirping]
Hmm. What now?
- Afternoon, missy.
- Sheriff.
- Would you mind taking off your jacket?
- Excuse me?
Oh, it's nothing personal. I'd just like
you to take off your jacket, please.
- I will not.
- Please.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>You are fired.!</i>
I want you to know
I've seen <i>Deliverance.</i>
You wanna give me
one of these?
Oh! That's good enough. My, my!
Guess you can put some cuffs
on this young lady.
Ma'am, you're under arrest for violation
of the criminal code 369.7.
And what the hell is that?
<i>Carrying a concealed weapon.</i>
<i>It says so right here in the book.</i>
<i>Highlighted in yellow.</i>
<i>[Sheriff]</i>
<i>I guess you'll be going with me.</i>
Jarod.
[Exhales]
So let me get this straight.
<i>This</i> starts out as a part of this...
but then you punch it out,
and you sell it as a separate product.
I think you got it.
Doughnut. Doughnut hole.
I don't mean to belabor a point...
but if the hole is here,
why do you call this the hole?
The truth is,
I've always wondered that myself.
But don't tell my boss. I wouldn't want him
to think I don't know the business.
I promise.
And I'll have another one, please.
On the house.
Oh. If you don't mind,
I'd rather eat it here.
<i>Good morning, Mr. Kembrook.!</i>
He seems very sad.
<i>[Woman] Poor man. He hasn't been</i>
<i>the same since Marvin was killed.</i>
- Marvin.
- <i>His son.</i>
He was a guard at the BoswellJewelers.
About a month ago,
he was shot trying to rob it.
Sounds like you know the family
pretty well.
Hmm. Since I was born.
Mr. Kembrook anyway.
I'm afraid you've lost me.
The Kembrooks gave Marvin up
for adoption when he was just a baby.
A few years after Mrs. Kembrook died,
Mr. Kembrook started searching for his son.
- Found him six months ago.
- He must have been very happy.
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>They both were.</i>
<i>Turns out Marvin was looking</i>
<i>for his parents the whole time too.</i>
Can you imagine meeting your own parents
for the first time when you're a grown adult?
Guess it would be pretty emotional.
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
Even after all those years,
they still loved each other.
What makes you so sure?
<i>Because they were blood,</i>
<i>and there's nothing stronger than that.</i>
<i>[Door Bells Jingling]</i>
<i>[Woman] Mrs. Morgan,</i>
<i>we may have a sighting on your daughter.</i>
<i>My people are flying</i>
<i>to New York as we speak.</i>
<i>If all goes well, you should have</i>
<i>your arms around Catherine...</i>
<i>by tomorrow night.</i>
Thank you. God bless you too.
How can I help you?
I don't know who I am.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Now, let me get this straight.</i>
You stopped me because
of an anonymous phone call?
<i>[Sheriff]</i>
<i>Uh-huh.</i>
<i>Do you mind telling me how you knew</i>
<i>this person was telling the truth?</i>
He sounded honest.
It's official. I'm in hell!
Oh, now, darlin', you did have
that concealed weapon on you...
<i>and you'll be able to post bail</i>
<i>as soon as Judge Hargrave get back</i>
<i>from that bass tournament...</i>
and we sign ourselves some papers.
- When exactly is that?
- Day after tomorrow.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
The entire legal staff at the Centre...
is on their annual retreat
in the south of France...
so it will be at least 72 hours
before we can even reach a lawyer.
He knew that.
Damn it, Sydney.
He's up to something.
And he needs me out of the way
for three days.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>10:19.</i>
<i>Could be a time reference.</i>
Forget that!
Just get me a lawyer.
Any lawyer.
<i>[Granger] Most missing persons cases</i>
<i>fall into one of three categories:</i>
<i>abductions, runaways</i>
<i>or abandonment.</i>
I'm looking for my parents.
What makes you think I can help?
I read in the paper that you helped reunite
a father and son after 25 years.
<i>Friendly warning:</i>
<i>They don't all turn out that way.</i>
There's a risk a person takes
when they search for their past.
<i>It's not always what they hope for.</i>
I'd be willing to risk anything
for the chance to find out.
Are they still alive?
<i>[Young Sydney]</i>
<i>Jarod, is he still alive?</i>
The eyes.
<i>What about the eyes?</i>
He wants to cry...
but he can't.
Why not?
<i>He feels alone, forgotten.</i>
He just doesn't care anymore.
- Care about who?
- <i>Himself.</i>
He's given up.
I won't give up, Sydney.
[Echoing]
I'll never give up.
<i>Officer Starr?</i>
- <i>Jarod.</i>
- Hmm?
I was wondering if you knew
if your parents were still alive.
I don't know.
I was never told the truth.
Why not use the police database
to initiate a search?
I can't.
This is probably gonna be hard to understand,
but I don't have much time.
- <i>Seventy-two hours.</i>
- Without a name...
I have a picture.
This is my mother.
At least that's what I was told.
And my father
might have been an aviator.
- In the service?
- I don't know.
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.
Officer Starr.
<i>There's a group</i>...
<i>people like yourself.</i>
There's a meeting here tomorrow night
if you're interested.
Sometimes it helps
just to know you're not alone.
- [Sighs]
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
<i>[Man Laughing]</i>
Miss Parker. You wanted a lawyer?
- Henry?
- Oh. [Chuckling]
Tell me you're kidding.
HenryJ. MonroeJr., Esquire.
Finest attorney in Cedar Point.
Truth be known,
the only attorney in Cedar Point.
[Wheezing Laugh]
He knew this.
<i>[Desk Sergeant]</i>
<i>Ma'am, there's nothing I can do.</i>
<i>You don't understand.</i>
<i>This is a death sentence for me.</i>
- Millie?
- What?
Finally! Someone with
half a brain in their head.
- You know this woman?
- We've met.
- What's the problem?
- I, uh...
I accidentally sideswiped
a meat wagon...
down on Biscayne Boulevard.
Now they want to put me in cement boots
and dump me into the causeway.
She ran an empty county ambulance
off the road...
and we're suspending
her driver's license.
Can you give us a moment, please?
Be my guest.
I wouldn't trust that one
as far as I can throw her.
Millie, this is very serious.
What if that ambulance was
carrying somebody to the hospital?
Geez, I don't want to hurt anybody.
Look, my, uh...
my husband's dead...
and my kids are all gone.
They're on their own.
I'm 73 years old...
and I'm alone.
You take my bike...
you take my independence.
<i>You take that,</i>
<i>you might as well bury me...</i>
'cause I'll... I'll be dead.
A lovely ruby, emerald
and sapphire trio...
bordered by diamonds.
- How much is it?
- <i>Only $4,000.</i>
Hmm. That's not enough.
Well, I do have this brilliant...
princess-cut diamond
with a trillion on either side...
for 5,000.
With tax that would be 5,328.
That's perfect.
I'll take it.
You do realize this purchase
is going to max out your credit card.
That's the idea.
[Chuckling]
<i>[TV: Indistinct]</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>An odyssey of searching for the past...</i>
came to a dramatic and emotional
conclusion earlier this morning...
as Harold Kembrook nervously waited
for the doors of the taxi to open...
and deliver his son,
given up for adoption...
<i>some 25 years earlier.</i>
As fate would have it...
his son, Marvin Howard Kembrook...
had spent the last 11 years
on the very same hunt...
<i>for his true identity.</i>
Also on hand to witness
the emotional reunion...
was Susan Granger...
<i>the woman instrumental in bringing</i>
<i>the two men together, father and</i>...
<i>[TV: Off]</i>
<i>[Knocking On Door]</i>
Just a second.
- You Starr?
- That's me.
You ordered the doughnuts.
- Raspberry Supremes?
- Whatever.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Mmm.! This should cover it.</i>
Hey.
I'm gonna go out on a real limb here
and take a guess...
that you're a big doughnut fan?
- They're very good.
- What are you, like, a cop?
How did you know?
That's funny.
Detective Swindell?
I hope you don't mind
if I skip the birthday song.
I never actually learned the words.
- You read my file. That's my job.
- It's a Bavarian cream.
I was thinking about getting you a Raspberry
Supreme, but somebody ate the last one.
But this one's very good.
Most uniforms don't want
to socialize with I.A.
The truth is, I'm thinking about putting in
for a transfer to Internal Affairs...
and the examination requires that the
applicant break down an actual case file...
- And you want my help.
- I heard you were very thorough.
Uh, do you have
any particular case in mind?
Yes, I do.
Are you going to eat that?
So, according to the field report...
Bishop and Meyers responded to
a robbery call at the jewelry store.
When they get there,
a security guard, Marvin Kembrook...
is robbing the place...
with an accomplice.
So this accomplice shoots Kembrook...
and then he gets away.
This sounds more like an unsolved homicide
than an I.A. investigation.
Forensics went over that store
with a fine-tooth comb.
They didn't find a print, a fiber, nothing.
- So this accomplice was efficient.
- [Chuckles]
If you're ever gonna make it in I.A.,
you have to realize that part of the job...
is to get inside the heads of the people
involved in the case.
<i>Marvin Kembrook spent</i>
<i>most ofhis life in foster homes.</i>
When he was 18, he joined the marines.
I looked up his military file.
He tested in the lowest
five percent of his unit...
spent 10 years in uniform
and never busted corporal.
Not exactly a criminal mastermind.
<i>We're talking about a young man</i>
<i>whojust found out who he was...</i>
<i>where he came from.</i>
He had $2,000 in his bank account.
His bills were paid.
You want to tell me he'd throw
all that away for a fast score?
So if you don't think
that Kembrook was involved...
and the accomplice was fictitious...
who did it?
There was one piece of hard evidence
left at the scene...
the slug they dug out
of Marvin Kembrook's chest.
Find the gun that fired that bullet,
and you find the real killer.
- Oh, man!
- <i>[Toilet Flushing]</i>
What, you're late again, huh?
The desk sarge is gonna have my butt
in a sling if she catches me.
- Can you do me a favor?
- What's up?
My transfer papers got sent
to my house by mistake.
Would you give them to her,
after I'm gone?
- No problem.
- Thanks.
Hey, listen. You know, I'm kind of new
around here and don't know many people.
I was thinking maybe I could take you
and your partner to lunch one day.
- My treat.
- Yeah, sure. How 'bout tomorrow?
- Great. I look forward to it.
- All right, man.
- Hey, partner. How's it going?
- All right, bro.
Read this. I think we found
the guy we've been looking for.
Yeah?
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>It's been almost 11 years...</i>
<i>since my son disappeared...</i>
<i>and there isn't a day that goes by...</i>
<i>that I don't think I see him...</i>
standing on a street corner...
or passing by on a city bus.
My friends, they all say,
"You should let it go."
But, I mean,
how do you deny yourself?
How do you just...
walk away from your life?
<i>You don't.</i>
We've been coming here for more years
than I want to remember...
more years
than any of us want to admit.
You people know my story,
what happened to my son.
- <i>[Woman's Voice Overlapping]</i>
- I'm here to tell you that you should never give up.
Never stop looking for the people
that you love because it's worth it...
even if it's for just a moment.
<i>You know, we sit here and we...</i>
<i>talk about</i>
<i>how much we miss them and...</i>
<i>how much we loved them.</i>
In the end, I think it's...
<i>I think it's the little things</i>
<i>that we miss the most.</i>
The way we see ourselves
in our children.
- [Voices Overlapping]
- The way he sat in a chair.
His laugh.
The way he stirred his coffee.
- <i>[Jarod's Mother's Voice] Never give up...</i>
- Never give up...
- <i>ever.</i>
- <i>ever.</i>
- [Siren Wailing]
- <i>[Man] Ah, baby,</i>
<i>you are bumming my trip, man.</i>
- <i>[Millie] Pint-sized nerd.!</i>
- <i>Nerd? I'm real, man.</i>
<i>[Millie] You weren't looking</i>
<i>where you were going.!</i>
- <i>I wasn't going anywhere.</i>
- You don't have to yell. I'm not deaf.
No, you're blind, lady.
You gotta take a chill...
Well, I wanna tell you.
You just better have a little respect!
- What seems to be the trouble?
- Feeble Knievel here almost
cut me in half with her tricycle.
- You little punk!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay. That is enough.
That is enough. You, stay here.
You, come with me.
Look at that.
- Is that it?
- Yeah.
It's nothing that a little sandpaper
and touch-up paint won't cure.
- You do have insurance?
- Yeah, but I'm not gonna let that old bag get away.
She almost wasted me, man.
What have we here?
<i>An expired license plate.</i>
That's gonna cost you about
a hundred bucks in fines.
And I could, of course,
search your van.
- Sandpaper and touch-up paint on...
- Mm-hmm.
Have a nice day.
- <i>And you, young lady, you're coming with me.</i>
- Oh. Where?
There.
<i>[Meyers]</i>
<i>So what did your wife do next?</i>
<i>[Meyers]</i>
<i>So what did your wife do next?</i>
<i>She walks in, she packs her bags,</i>
<i>and then she splits.</i>
- Ouch.
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Why would I make up a story like that?
- They are so unbelievable.
It's incredible. Next time I talked to her,
we were in some lawyer's office, 100 bucks per.
- Sounds like my last wife.
- Oh, no.
- Marriage number three?
- No. Four.
Four? Geez!
What, you got, like, a thousand kids?
- No, six. Six real good kids.
- And they don't look like him.
Shut up, Frank.
Must be tough making ends meet,
with all those obligations.
I make sure everybody's
well taken care of.
Still, you know,
there's gotta be a better way.
- What, like Chicago?
- Chicago?
Yeah, we know about the investigation...
<i>the payoff money you were collecting</i>
<i>from the dealers on the South Side.</i>
- You read my file.
- New guy comes in, we check him out.
You'd do the same thing.
You had no right to read my file.
Besides, they never proved anything.
It proves that you can cover your tracks,
so take it easy.
<i>Frank and I do thejob, but we're</i>
<i>always looking for new opportunities.</i>
- Isn't that right, Frank?
- That's right.
Takes a special kind of cop
to do what we do.
We think you're that cop.
That's all.
I'm sorry, sir.
Your credit card came back invalid.
That's impossible.
Try running it through the right way.
<i>I know how to do myjob.</i>
<i>I tried it three times, okay?</i>
Look, there's some mistake, obviously.
- <i>I always pay off my credit card.</i>
- <i>There's no mistake.</i>
<i>Frank, looks like we're gonna have to bail</i>
<i>this deadbeat out before he pulls his gun...</i>
and tries to shoot his way out of here.
- Thanks.
- <i>Gracias.</i>
Look, I gotta take my kid
to Little League practice. Thanks, buddy.
Drop by the park in a couple of hours.
We'll talk about it then, okay?
- I'll think about it.
- Yeah, you do that.
Got a little something right here.
Thanks for lunch.
Yeah.
<i>[Granger On Phone]</i>
<i>We got a red flag on your mother's photo.</i>
- Someplace in Delaware.
- Delaware?
- <i>Mean anything to you?</i>
- <i>[Jarod] It used to.</i>
Well, someone picked up the global scan
on the Net that we sent out.
We got an anonymous phone call.
Whoever it was, recognized the woman
in the picture and has a name...
but they're adamant about not sending anything
over the computer system or phone lines.
I mean, it seems strange.
You want to go forward with this?
- Yes.
- Okay.
They're sending the information
by special courier.
- I'll call you the second it gets here.
- Thank you.
- <i>[Footsteps]</i>
- <i>[Woman] Broots?</i>
<i>Wejust got a signal alert on Jarod.</i>
- Where?
- A missing persons agency in Miami.
But we also monitored a response signal
emanating from inside the Centre.
Someone on the inside made contact
with this agency?
Well, what kind of information
was breached?
We... We're not sure.
Has anyone alerted Miss Parker?
We thought you'd want to.
I'd rather stick my head in a bear trap.
- <i>[Bat Hitting Ball]</i>
- <i>[Bishop] Yeah.!</i>
- <i>So how many of thesejobs have you pulled?</i>
- What difference does it make?
We're throwing you a rope. The question is,
are you smart enough to grab it?
- Why do you need a third guy?
- 'Cause we had problems the last time out.
We need a third guy
to plug up the leaks.
- How does it work?
- We use the security codes supplied by the stores.
- Low risk, high reward.
- Oh, yeah.
- What if something goes wrong?
- It won't.
Humor me.
What if somebody walks in?
<i>We're wearing blue.</i>
<i>We're the good guys.</i>
They're not gonna suspect us of a crime.
They'll think we're responding to one.
- What if they pull a gun?
- Then we take 'em down.
I mean, we just make it look like,
uh, we stopped a robbery in progress.
- We're home free.
- Is that what happened with Marvin Kembrook?
- <i>What do you know about that?</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Come on.</i>
I read your files too.
What I don't understand is, how did you
tamper with the ballistic report?
- What?
- <i>They never made a match</i>
<i>to the weapon that killed Kembrook.</i>
Internal Affairs always checks
the weapons of the first officers...
that arrive at the scene of a homicide.
Think I was wrong about you, Jarod.
Let's go, Frank.
Whoa, wait a minute.
You're asking me to risk everything.
All I'm asking is,
if something goes wrong...
do I have a way out?
Throwaway. Ankle holster.
Unregistered.
Something goes down, we use it. Put it in the
trunk of my car, wait for the heat to blow over.
Look, are you in or what?
- I'm in.
- Good.
I'm glad you're on the team, Starr.
But if you cross me,
I'll put a bullet in your heart.
Dad! Dad!
Let's go! All right!
Tommy. Attaboy. Ohh!
- You looked great out there.
- Want ice cream?
<i>[Tommy]</i>
<i>Yeah.!</i>
I plan on suing this entire dirt-water town
for every penny it's worth.
- My card.
- Stanton.
- Let's get out of here.
- Oh, Miss Parker.
- <i>Do you know a man by the name of Broots?</i>
- Take a message.
He says he located the target!
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- <i>De nada.</i>
<i>[Jarod's Mother's, Kembrook's Voices]</i>
<i>His laugh.</i>
<i>The way he stirred his coffee.</i>
Mom?
[Sighs]
<i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>
- <i>[Phone Beeps]</i>
- Starr here.
It's Susan Granger.
Your envelope is here.
I'm on my way.
- [Tires Screeching]
- <i>[Miss Parker] You know, Syd,</i>
<i>I oughta hand it to him.</i>
He almost kept me out of the picture
long enough.
- He wants to know the truth.
- He can't, and you know it.
Hmm.
It's only because of his heart.
- What?
- That we are this close, Miss Parker.
<i>Jarod knew that ifhe sent</i>
<i>that photograph online...</i>
we'd find him.
<i>He's willing to risk everything</i>
<i>for an identity...</i>
for a life.
That's what I'm counting on.
[Tires Screech]
I thought you should be
the one to open it.
- I'm so nervous.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
- It isn't every day you find out who you are.
- <i>[Clamoring]</i>
What is going on out here?
Who are you people?
- Where is he?
- <i>[Gun Cocks]</i>
I won't ask again.
<i>Sam. Sam, he's going to the roof!</i>
Stop, or I swear
I'll shoot you in the back!
<i>Jarod.!</i>
<i>Sam, get him.</i>
- You sent this, didn't you?
- I was with you, Miss Parker.
So close...
and yet so far.
Hi. This is Officer Starr.
I was wondering
if you could do me a favor.
[Bishop] We got 15 minutes before
the security car comes back around.
- You got the alarm code, right, Frank?
- Yeah.
I'll shut off the juice, then clip
the video lines to the surveillance cameras.
Once we're inside, Frankie's gonna go
to the manager's office and get the gems.
You hit the gold cases.
I'll keep an eye on the front.
- What if the security guard is early?
- He won't be.
- What if you're wrong?
- If I'm wrong, they're dead.
<i>The clock is running, gentlemen.</i>
<i>Let's do this thing.</i>
All right, guys. Let's do this.
- Frank, you all right?
- <i>I got the manager's office.</i>
Starr.
Coins, rings and chains, all right?
Stay away from the stupid costume crap.
Let's do it.
- [Imitates Gunshot]
- What are you doing?
<i>I was just wondering how Marvin Kembrook</i>
<i>felt the night he died.</i>
[Scoffs]
All right. All right.
We'll talk about that later, okay?
<i>He answers an alarm.</i>
His heart is pounding
at the potential danger.
He feels afraid, with good reason.
<i>Hejust got his life back.</i>
<i>Hejust figured out who he was.</i>
He just rediscovered his family.
Imagine his relief when he gets there
and finds two police officers on the scene.
<i>The good guys.</i>
His relief didn't last very long, did it?
You're under arrest for the murder
of Marvin Kembrook.
- Maybe I don't want to be arrested.
- [Gun Clicks]
You're going to jail.
<i>You and Meyers.</i>
All right, Starr.
I'm just gonna put the gun down.
<i>Hey, what the hell is going on?</i>
Sorry about that, Jarod.
<i>I don't dojail.</i>
Too many mouths to feed.
Oh, my God.
<i>Call it in, Frank.</i>
- What am I supposed to tell 'em?
- Tell 'em the truth.
Tell 'em one of our finest was gunned down
trying to prevent a robbery.
<i>[Bishop] We turned up the alley here and</i>
<i>saw somebody running out the back door.</i>
<i>Frank and I went inside,</i>
<i>identified ourselves as officers...</i>
but the place was empty
except for the body.
The body?
Officer Starr apparently
was the first one on the scene.
<i>We came back outside</i>
<i>and searched the adjacent area...</i>
but the shooter was long gone.
Is that the way it happened?
Meyers!
Is that the way it happened?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's how it happened.
Show me.
Yes, ma'am.
<i>Let's get the lab boys down here</i>
<i>to check out that slug.</i>
<i>[Officer]</i>
<i>Right away, Detective.</i>
Care to revise your story,
Officer Bishop?
The body was lying right here.
I swear it. I saw it myself.
Keys.
- Keys?
- Let's have a look in the trunk of your car.
[Engine Running]
- Let's roll!
- Hold on tight!
I'm legal!
<i>[Laughing]</i>
<i>You're under arrest for the murder</i>
<i>of Marvin Kembrook.</i>
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>
<i>If you give up the right</i>

I just missed, Sydney.
No more, no less.
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>
Hello. Jarod.
I told you when I was 11 years old
that I would never give up...
and I never will.
I know you won't, Jarod.
Miss Parker won't either.
- Good-bye, Sydney.
- Hold it.
Just tell me one thing, Jarod.
- What do the numbers mean?
- What?
10:19.
It's who I am, Sydney.
It's what you made me.

Where will he go now?
- South.
- What makes you so sure?
Instinct.
<i>[Brass Band: "O Canada'"]</i>
[Clucks Tongue]
[Mews]
- <i>[Bell Ringing]</i>
- <i>Sorry about the principal not</i>
<i>being able to give you the tour.</i>
He's real busy.
Working up the school lunch schedule
is trying work, I'm sure.
This was Mr. Jarod's classroom.
He was, like, the best substitute.
Kids would sit in on the class
even though they weren't enrolled.
And he did
the coolest experiments.
- I can see that.
- Oh, yeah.
<i>We even did a virology unit on bugs</i>
<i>to learn their resiliency.</i>
He told us that roaches would be the only
living thing after a biological holocaust...
them and some woman
named Parker.
Hardly sounds like
high school biology.
Mr. Jarod, like,
marched to his own drummer.
He's a one-man band, all right.
The best part is he wouldn't grade us.
It was like he was
conducting his own experiment...
<i>and we were collecting</i>
<i>the data for him.</i>
You run along to homeroom now.
Aah!
<i>Carlos?</i>
Wait! Come back here!
Hold it right there!
Come on, now! Stop!
- Carlos, come on! That's it!
- Aah!
- Where's your dad?
- Down the hall, last room.
My name is Jarod.
You're going to be just fine.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
Okay, the father's symptoms
include weight loss, fever...
night sweats, violent cough,
swollen lymph nodes...
- <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</i>
- Looks like it.
- You don't see that much anymore.
- No.
- But he'll be fine once we get him admitted.
- How's the boy?
Too early to tell.
But much better off than you're gonna be...
once Garber finds out
what you did with the kid.
Violating quarantine procedures
with these people was damn foolish.
I realize it was
a bit unorthodox, sir...
but T.B. is
a Level 2 classification.
It doesn't require
an on-site quarantine.
Friendly advice, Dr. Reilly. If you don't wanna
end up dead, you'll remember that...
every one of these situations should be
treated as a Level 4 situation.
<i>Walter, whether or not the boy was already</i>
<i>exposed, or</i>... <i>What difference does it make?</i>
- <i>He's protected either way.</i>
- <i>[Jarod] And the boy gets</i>
<i>to be with his father now.</i>
I felt like he needed that.
Great. Our new guy's
Florence Nightingale.
<i>[Man Coughing]</i>
<i>Yeah, you're gonna love this place.</i>
Stove and oven in the kitchen,
hot and cold running.
170 a month plus utilities.
- 170?
- Okay, 150.
I'll pay the water.
Come on down to the office.
- We'll sign the papers.
- Does it have roaches?
Of course not. This place is
a bohemian's dream, not some slum.
- Come on to the office.
- No roaches?
<i>[Violin]</i>
- Damn it!
- What is that?
It's a never-endin'
cat-gut nightmare is what it is...
not to mention
the worst rental decision...
<i>of my life.!</i>
<i>[Baby Crying]</i>
There's another building
two blocks west of here.
Might be able to find
somethin' quieter there.
No. I'll take this place.
It's a lot nicer
than where I used to live.
[Sneezes]
Bless you.
Sounds like the flu.
It's cold and rainy in Portland
this time of year.
Here, keep it.
It's clean.
So I took a trip without you.
Don't tell me you're jealous.
Confused.
I thought we were working together.
So did I, until I discovered
your personal ads...
all over the country
trying to contactJarod.
I don't like secrets.
Well, he wasn't answering my e-mail
messages, so I tried another tack.
But I would have let you know
if he had contacted me.
- I have a fever, Syd...
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
<i>but it's not bad enough</i>
<i>to believe that.</i>
- What?
- Um...
[Clears Throat]
He's in the lab.
Who?
Mr. Raines.
Mr. Raines hasn't been
in the lab in 10 years.
Well, uh, he's in there now...
<i>and he's looking for you two.</i>
So, good luck.
<i>[Labored Breathing]</i>
- Mr. Raines?
- The Empire State Building.
Who would've thought something
so beautiful could be replicated...
by a four-year-old boy
in only two hours?
<i>Jarod was brilliant</i>
<i>the day he got here.</i>
<i>He was brilliant the day he escaped.</i>
<i>And the question is...</i>
where is he?
Mr. Raines, Jarod has been
harder to catch than we thought.
Sydney, we need him.
- I know.
- [Sneezes]
[Coughs]
May I?
Mr. Raines, I have the flu.
I'm dying.
Mmm.
<i>[Coughing]</i>
Keep it.
Bring Jarod back where he belongs...
<i>or I'll get someone who will.</i>
Are we clear?
My father wants me to do it.
Unlike everyone else around here...
I'm not afraid of your father.
<i>I don't have to be.</i>
<i>[Garber] Ourjob here at RIDA</i>
<i>is to contain viral outbreaks...</i>
<i>before they spread.</i>
I've seen the worst that a virus can do,
and because of it...
by the numbers is usually best.
In retrospect, you did the right thing
with Briggs and his son, Jarod.
Listen, I was out of line.
It's all right.
Well, your credentials
are impressive.
A stint in BAMRI D in London...
M.D. /Ph. D in virology.
Where did you do your doctorate,
by the way?
- Horace Greeley High School, Portland.
- [Chuckling]
The door's under negative air pressure
to contain leaks.
Yeah, we pioneered
the technique here.
I noticed in your file that you were vaccinated
for anthrax and the W.E.E. series.
I was working in the Gulf
with NATO's Q. R. T...
and the W.E.E. was for the
Pekowsky Syndrome in Johannesburg.
- A frightening scenario.
- Yes, very.
Watching somebody suffer
can have an effect on you.
I hope I can make a difference here.
[Beeping]
[Female Electronic Voice]
Code accepted.
Jarod, Jeff Baytos...
decontamination
and facilities specialist.
- Nice to meet you.
- Uh, ix-nay on the andshake-hay, Doc.
[Chuckling]
Mr. Baytos tends to be overcautious.
No such thing in a place like this.
One wrong move
like pressing the flesh...
and, uh, it's off to
the submarine for 10,000 years.
You call your morgue the "submarine"?
What did you call it at BAMRI D?
Chernobyl.
Well, we're working
a Level 3 today.
An offshoot strain
of Rift Valley fever.
You ready to battle the unseen enemy?
Absolutely.
Will you be joining us,
Mr. Baytos?
Level 2 is my limit now, man.
Live long and prosper.
<i>[Garber Chuckles]</i>
Baytos witnessed a man die of Ebola.
He's been reluctant
to go past Level 2 ever since.
<i>Fortunately, he's the best there is...</i>
when it comes to decon.
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>It's nice to have visitors.</i>
<i>Our friends don't know what to think</i>
<i>or say, so theyjust stay away.</i>
<i>Did you meetJon in South Africa?</i>
No, but I heard a lot about him.
We were both working on separate
strike teams in the Mutaba village.
Oh. You know, he loved that job.
He was the first to arrive
and the last to leave.
He'd stay in places where there was
no hope, no chance to make a difference.
Holding the hand of a dying man
to let him know he's not alone...
<i>that's making a difference.</i>
I'm working with Walter Garber now. I'm
trying to finish the work your husband started.
Well, you're lucky
to be working under Walter.
<i>Jon thought the world ofhim.</i>
<i>That's them at the W.H.O. banquet.</i>
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
<i>Hey, you're supposed to be napping.</i>
I thought I heard Daddy.
No, it's not Daddy.
It's just a friend.
- Oh.
- Hi. My name's Jarod.
- Hi.
- Go lie down, honey.
<i>This has been especially hard on her.</i>
He vanished right before her birthday.
How do I explain that to Cindy?
I mean,
how do I explain any of it?
You know, l-I know
he's not coming back.
You know, l-I've accepted that.
I have.
I just, uh, wish I knew
where to go from here.
I mean, how to go from here.
<i>I mean, is he dead?</i>
<i>Is he alive?</i>
That's a very beautiful ring.
Jon designed our wedding bands.
You know, I know it's corny, but he wanted
them to be the only two alike in the world.
Here. Jon wore this when
he went into the field to work.
- He never got sick wearing it.
I'd like you to have it.
- l...
I couldn't possibly accept that.
No, he'd have wanted somebody
who cared as much as he did to have it.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Fits like a glove.
<i>[Chatter, Indistinct]</i>
- Excuse me. I was wondering if you might help me.
- Uh, sure. What's the problem?
It says here that
this is a-a motel for roaches?
Yeah. It's like, uh,
the Hotel California...
for our little
six-legged friends, you know?
Hotel California?
Yeah, they can check out anytime
they like, but they can never leave.
Oh.
Oh! Like a trap.
- Yeah. Somethin' like that.
- <i>Well, that's peryect.</i>
I'll take 100.
Right on.
- <i>[Trumpet]</i>
- <i>[Pounding On Wall]</i>
<i>[Woman] I'm gonna</i>
<i>wrap that thing around your neck...</i>
<i>if you don't shut up.!</i>
Come and get it.
- <i>[Pounding]</i>
- <i>You're a dead man, Hansel.!</i>
Come and get it.
<i>[Trumpet]</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>I've paid my rent. You can't evict me.</i>
Sir, my name is Jarod.
I'm your neighbor.
l-I just wanted to tell you that
I'm very intrigued by your music.
<i>I'm not falling for that.!</i>
I would very much like to meet you,
and I would like to ask you a question.
<i>[Chain Rattling]</i>
Are you here to give me the boot?
I wasn't planning on it, sir,
but you're more than welcome to mine.
Come in.
It's nice to have
a friendly audience for a change.
Ben Hansel's the name.
- Ben, I need your help.
- And I yours. Do you play?
I've conducted a symphony
here and there.
Ah! Well, then what
do you think of this?
[Loud, Harsh]
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Shut up.! You're driving me crazy.!</i>
- Cultural dwarves, all of them.
- <i>[Man] You suck.!</i>
That's very interesting.
Haydn's "Cello Concerto in "C' Major,"
I believe.
I rewrote it for trumpet. I'm working
on an arrangement for glockenspiel.
- An artist must stretch, you know.
- Yes.
- How long have you been a musician?
- Fifteen-odd years.
That's a long time.
But it'll all be worth it
when the philharmonic calls.
<i>I sent them a tape about a week ago.</i>
- You... You had a question.
- Yes.
I'm trying to attract roaches, and this
doesn't seem to work. Do you have any?
Roaches?
I can't get rid of them.
I spilled a box of Crunchy Crawlers
cereal behind the fridge once.
Now every night,
they come out hunting.
- Crunchy Crawlers?
- "They're grotesquely delicious."
You know, I was wondering about
my interpretation of the first movement.
It was a tad subtle.
Subtlety is a virtue in any form.
A neighbor who's a scholar of
the arts and letters. Thank you, Jarod.
Um, you can yell at me
through the wall anytime.
And thank you for the tip.
You will do very nicely here.
<i>[Jarod] In seconds,</i>
<i>the virus invades the host cell.</i>
- With a Level 4 virus, the results are devastating.
- [Chattering, Laughing]
<i>The Mutaba village outbreak.</i>
Subjects begin coughing
only four hours after exposure.
Internal bleeding
commences at hour 12...
and by hour 36...
the subject completely bleeds out.
- [Chattering]
- <i>Gentlemen, you can ignore</i>
<i>the flight attendant...</i>
as she tries to teach you
how to fasten the seat belt...
but with the Mutaba virus
and other level fours...
<i>the kill rate is 90%.</i>
And, may I add,
an airborne virus...
coupled with a pinprick
in your glove or a faulty seal...
sends you into the slammer,
and from there...
it's an express
straight to the submarine.
Lights.
<i>Thank you for</i>
<i>the safety review, Dr. Reilly.</i>
You misled them back there.
You and Jon Florence did develop
a vaccine for the Cahuenga virus.
We got lucky on that.
But with Ebola or Mutaba...
Well, I have to keep 'em honest.
<i>I'm sorry about Dr. Florence.</i>
<i>You must miss him.</i>
- Very much.
- From what I understand,
Dr. Florence was a family man.
- <i>Hardly the type tojust up and leave.</i>
- He was a good man.
Of all people,
you two should know that...
awful things swirl beneath
the healthiest of exteriors.
Jon confided in me that
things at home weren't optimal.
<i>He never went into specifics, but he certainly</i>
<i>enjoyed working the extra hours here...</i>
rather than being at home.
<i>This is an airborne Level 4 virus.</i>
<i>Let's be on our toes.</i>
Commencing phase two dissection.
We are 72 hours after expiration
by Mutaba strain "B,"
<i>subject 247.</i>
- Walter.
- Good God.
- Decon!
- Come on. Let's move it. Go!
- <i>[Alarm Blaring]</i>
- Okay, let's remain calm.
Proceed with decon shower.
- Coming through.
- <i>[Garber] Stay calm. You'll be fine.</i>
- Code denied.
- Damn it! The code isn't working!
Here, let me.
[Electronic Voice]
Code accepted.
- Get the glove off.
- Inoculate.
Hurry up.
No skin breaks.
The blood must've been from the sample.
Well done, everybody.
Everything by the numbers.
We'll review
the security tape tomorrow.
Well, you handled that simulation
as if it were completely real, Jarod.
Well, I've had a lot of practice, sir.
Who changed the slammer access code?
Lisa, the fewer people that have the code,
the fewer people that are at risk.
I don't want anybody near the slammer
unless they have to be.
- It's your funeral.
- No, it's his.
Garber's the only person that has
the access code to the slammer?
And the submarine.
Oh, Jon.
How's my goddaughter?
About to turn six, but she thinks she's 16.
I hope you can make it to her party.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
I've proceeded with the autopsy
on the monkey. Look at the liver.
Mush.
This virus has mutated.
We'll finish this first thing Monday.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been...
Oh, my God...
33 years since my last confession.
I have betrayed a friend.
Then you must seek his forgiveness.
Mm-mmm.
He has shut me out.
You're troubled by something else.
Have you prayed to the Lord
for forgiveness?
Not even he can forgive me
for what I've done.
Look at the liver.
- [Jon] Mush. This virus has mutated.
- Mm-hmm.
It's like the Cahuenga virus,
but worse.
This is a Level 5 virus.
What the hell have you done?
You made Ebola look like the flu.
- I've been working on it, genetically.
- No, you've been playing God.
We gotta shut down this project now.
- I'm destroying it.
- You can't.
- Yes, I can.
- I won't let you.
Let go of my air hose!
- I won't let you.
- Let go of my air hose!
- I won't let you.
- Let go of my air hose! Let go of my air hose!
My God, Walter, you've killed me!
Quick, into the decon shower.
- [Alarm Blaring]
- The lab is full of the virus.
Stay calm. Don't panic.
Pressure failure! Get into the slammer.
I'll meet you there.
Hello, Jon.
I was afraid I'd find you here.
<i>[Cello]</i>
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Hansel, you are driving me nuts.!</i>
<i>Shut up.!</i>
Interesting interpretation.
- <i>[Pounding On Wall]</i>
- <i>[Man] You suck.!</i>
You're a polite neighbor, Jarod...
but I fear the cultural dwarves
are right.
I'm terrible.
It takes a long time
to master music, Ben.
A lifetime would not be
long enough for me.
My music kills plant life.
I'm Salieri to Mozart, Jarod.
I curse God for bestowing me
with mediocre ability.
[Music Box]
<i>What are these?</i>
Trifles, larks.
Pointless exercises.
Did you make these?
Yes.
Ben, these are exquisite.
Your compliment
is appreciated, Jarod.
But, art it is not.
Art is many things.
Some choose a brush,
some a bow...
some a pen,
and some... choose glass.
What do you mean?
Maybe the way you create is
through these pieces rather than that.
<i>You said it yourself, Ben.</i>
Sometimes an artist
needs to stretch.
[Beeping]
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>Sydney, I'm scared. I can't do this.</i>
<i>[Young Sydney]</i>
<i>You have to, Jarod.</i>
There's smoke.
People are screaming.
Sydney, they're burning!
They're burning!
Make it stop!
Make the burning stop!
- Jarod!
- Make it stop!
No, go away!
Leave me alone!
It's all right, Jarod.
It's all right.
Aah!
It's all over, Jarod.
It's all right.
- I want my daddy.
- The code word makes it stop, Jarod.
- You didn't use the code word we came up with.
- I said, I want my dad.
Let me.
Jarod, remember.
When you're doing the simulation
and you become frightened...
and wanna stop, say, "Refuge."
All right?
Mm-hmm?
Refuge.
[Beeping]
<i>[Miss Parker Sneezing]</i>
[Coughing]
He contacted me.
No secrets.
Why the sudden change of heart?
Lately, I've been seeing things
from another angle...
and maybe it's best if you get him.
Dr. Hoffman,
do you have a minute?
What's up?
- What do you make of this?
- Hmm?
Well, let's see.
Liquefication of organs, blood secretion
through skin pores, loss of hair.
Looks like an advanced
version of Mutaba.
That's what I thought
until I found <i>this.</i>
I've never seen this before.
Did you cross-check it?
Against every sample on record.
There's over 3,000 on record.
It did get a little tedious
after the first 800.
- [Chattering]
- <i>[Hoffman] My God.</i>
Jarod, this is worse than
any Level 4 I've ever seen.
- It's a Level 5.
- What?
There's a Level 5 here?
It's a sample off a body
in the submarine.
Wait. H-How did you get
in the submarine? Only Gar...
Go. Go.
Garber has the code.
Is all research here sanctioned
by a governing body?
Which project isn't?
It's only hearsay,
but I trust the source.
Garber was working on some research.
l-I don't know what.
What else did Jon Florence tell you?
How'd you know Jon was the source?
Besides Garber,
he was the only person...
that knew everything
that was going on here.
What else did he tell you?
That Garber was working on
some radical mutations of a Level 5.
He said it started out good,
but it got corrupted.
Jon said God
would never forgive him...
if he let this project continue.
Well, unfortunately
forJon Florence...
he never had the chance to stop it.
Oh, my God.
[Jon]
Mush. This virus has mutated.
Mm-hmm.
We'll finish this first thing Monday.
<i>[Tape Rewinding]</i>
I'm guessing between the knob,
the mouthpiece and the city water
you're drinking...
there's enough germs
to kill a cockroach.
Dr. Reilly. Hi.
Yeah, you're probably right.
I deal with the germs I can,
but something tells me...
I wouldn't last long
living in a plastic bubble.
Even one equipped
with a decon shower?
It was an excellent
performance, Jeff.
Look, l-I don't know
what you mean.
Are you gonna make me enhance
the image so I can see your face?
Do you know what it's like
not being able to sleep?
You'd be surprised.
I watched a man beg for his life.
He begged to see
his wife and kid again, and l...
l... I didn't help him.
I know Jon Florence got infected,
I know his body's in the submarine...
and I know that you helped
Garber doctor this tape.
But what I can't figure out is why.
Because it was my fault,
that's why.
l-I was working late
likeJon and Dr. Garber...
and l-I saw Jon
come into the slammer...
and he-he...
he looked so frightened.
The decon shower lost pressure...
and that is my job
to make sure that it doesn't.
That-That is my job, Dr. Reilly.
And then Garber went ballistic,
and he blamed me forJon's contamination.
You know, l-I have never seen a virus
do what it did to him, or so quickly.
And that's why you won't
go past Level 2 anymore.
It's just thatJon...
he begged me to get
his wife and kid...
and-and Garber...
Garber told me to keep it quiet.
He said that... that the authorities
would have to be called...
and that they would
shut down the facility...
and that more lives
would be lost because of my error.
Jon Florence did not die
because of you or the decon shower.
He died because
Walter Garber murdered him.
Hello, Butcher Bob's?
I'd like to order a dozen pig livers,
please. Yes, a dozen.
Say "cheese."
Good morning, class.
Today's lesson takes us into
the fascinating world of cockroaches.
- Walter?
- <i>Yes?</i>
It's Jarod.
I've made a very interesting discovery
that I think you should check out.
- What have you got?
- Well, it's still too early to be sure...
but I think I found
a vaccine for Mutaba.
- I'll-I'll meet you in the lab in an hour, Jarod.
- Perfect.
What have you got?
Where'd you get the sample?
From this liver.
My God, man!
It's an airborne virus!
Walter, your air hose.
- <i>Hit the alarm.! Help me.!</i>
- <i>[Alarm Blaring]</i>
Help me!
God!
Oh! There's pressure failure
in the decon line!
Well, you'd better
get into the slammer, sir.
<i>[Electronic Voice]</i>
<i>Code accepted.</i>
Where is everybody?
Where are the doctors?
Baytos!
There's nobody here, sir.
- I sent them all home.
- Jarod, you've killed me!
Relax, Walter. I told you.
I made a little discovery.
It's a derivative cross between your
Cahuenga virus and the Rift Valley strain.
An anti-virus.
It shuts your strain down.
Give it to me, please.
- I can't.
- Jarod, please, help me!
Like you helped Jon Florence...
by exposing him to
a Level 5 without any cure?
Who the hell are you?
Well, I sure as hell
am not Florence Nightingale.
But, then again, neither are you.
How long, Walter?
How long beforeJon Florence
started to show symptoms?
<i>How long before</i>
<i>the internal bleeding started?</i>
How long before his brain tissues
started to leak into his ears?
How long before his internal organs
started to liquefy? How long, Walter?
- Give me that syringe.
- <i>Why?</i>
Jon Florence never had this option.
Why should you?
- Jarod, it was an accident.
- He knew he was going to die.
And I'll bet the last thing he wanted to do
was just to see his family one more time...
to say good-bye to his wife
and to his child.
But you couldn't give him that peace,
could you, Walter?
<i>Because then the truth would come out</i>
<i>about how you were trying to play God...</i>
<i>with all these viral experiments.</i>
You tookJon Florence's life...
and you ruined his family's as well.
- That is no accident.
- All right, I did it. I admit it. I killed him!
<i>The-The research</i>
<i>was very valuable.</i>
- Please, give me the vaccine!
- All right, Walter.
But I will warn you.
It's only sugar water.
Sugar water?
I don't know how to make a vaccine.
You see, I'm not really a virologist.
- The truth is, this place gives me the creeps.
- What?
You can check out anytime you like,
but you can never leave.
No! No!
Don't leave me! Jarod!
<i>[Over Monitor]</i>
<i>Jarod.! Come back here.!</i>
<i>Jarod.! Wait, don't.!</i>
<i>Please, don't leave me here.!</i>
<i>Please, don't.!</i>
Help! Help!
- Aren't you gonna tell him
you didn't really infect him?
- <i>[Shouting Continues]</i>
Nah. Why don't you do it?
In 48 hours.
<i>Help.! Please.!</i>
<i>Somebody, help.!</i>
- After the police get this.
- <i>Help me.!</i>
<i>Oh, no.! God.!</i>
<i>Oh, God, help me.!</i>
<i>Come back.!</i>
<i>Come back.!</i>
<i>Jarod.! Jarod.!</i>
- What is that smell?
- I can't smell.
Go left.
You take that room.
Good morning, class.
Today's lesson takes us into
the fascinating world of cockroaches.
- Nothing. He's gone.
- Yes, but not forgotten.
- [Groans]
- This is a bug motel.
When the hormones
off a roach's body...
<i>which is the wet stuff</i>
<i>you just walked through...</i>
<i>combines with the sticky stuff inside</i>
<i>of the box, which you are standing in...</i>
it forms a bond...
which is stronger than epoxy.
Welcome to the world's
largest bug motel.
You son of a bitch.
Enjoy your stay.
Class dismissed.
I'm stuck.
<i>[Trumpet]</i>
- <i>[Pounding On Wall]</i>
- <i>[Dog Barking]</i>
Chivas on the rocks.
One ice cube.
Clever way of contacting me, Sydney.
No one at the Centre
would've ever known what this meant.
I had to see you face-to-face.
Did Miss Parker take the bait?
Presumably.
I have to ask you for something.
You're in no position
to ask me for anything.
Not even your forgiveness?
- What?
- For keeping you in the Centre.
For the lies all these years.
Did you send me this?
No, I did not.
Parker did with your name on it.
- What is it?
- <i>Reminders.</i>
Issues I must take up
with myself...
God...
and with you.
- It's too late.
- I come to you with an olive branch.
All right.
You want my forgiveness?
Then tell me what happened
to my mom and dad.
I can't.
I don't know the truth.
Then you and the Centre
will never get me back.
And I can't forgive you, Sydney.
I can't forgive myself.
<i>[Ringing]</i>
- Ben Hansel.
- [Woman] Mr. Hansel,
this is the Chicago Philharmonic.
We received the extraordinary
glass sculpture you made...
and we'd like to set up a time for you
to meet with our merchandise coordinator.
We have next Wednesday available...
Thank you... for everything.
Where will you go now?
I'm starting a new job.
You've got roaches?
[Mews]
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>I just wanna know who I am.</i>
<i>I can stand anything for that.</i>
<i>I'll never give up, Sydney, ever.</i>
It's been three days, Jarod,
with temperature over 100 degrees.
You don't have to go on, Jarod.
I can do it.
I just wanna know who I am.
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>I can stand anything for that.</i>
- [Beeping]
- Where did they find this?
Cleanup crew found it in a cabin
about 50 miles south of Albuquerque.
- <i>[Sydney] A gift from Jarod.</i>
- Hmm. So, what does it mean?
I'm not sure what the original intent
of the simulation was.
<i>I'll have to run it</i>
<i>through the archives.</i>
<i>Save your sweat.</i>
<i>It's just another diversion.</i>
<i>I beg to differ, Miss Parker.</i>
<i>This is very important toJarod.</i>
He's reaching out,
taking a leap of faith.
<i>[Jarod Shouting] All right.</i>
<i>Now, remember what you learned in class.</i>
- I think I'm gonna throw up!
- Oh, no, no. You're gonna be just fine!
- Well, you're the expert.
- Sort of.
Sort of? Exactly how many times
have you jumped?
- Counting this?
- Yes!
One.
[Woman Screaming]
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
Tough jump?
I may have underestimated
my payload.
<i>Well, they come in all shapes</i>
<i>and sizes. Rub some of this on it.</i>
- What is it?
- Horse liniment.
They use it on thoroughbreds
when they pull a muscle.
A few more of them El Paso
housewives...
you'll be drinkin' the stuff.
[Sighs] Another
satisfied customer.
Nice to see that you can carry
your weight around here.
The instructor job is yours
if you still want it.
- Great! It's a pleasure to be here.
- Good.
Crockett. Did I get a call from Tasco?
<i>[Crockett]</i>
<i>Phone hasn't rung all day.</i>
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>How's the old girl holding up?</i>
[Scoffs] I was able to patch
the leak in the fuel pump...
but she's definitely on death's door.
<i>Just hold her together</i>
<i>for a few more days...</i>
<i>and I'll have that new plane</i>
<i>flown in from Phoenix.</i>
Your résumé is very impressive.
82nd Airborne, Army Ranger.
<i>Lofty credentials for someone looking</i>
<i>to teach the public to tuck and roll.</i>
- <i>Why us?</i>
- Well, I'm on the run from a secret organization.
I needed a place to hide out for a while.
<i>[Broots] We've been over this simulation a</i>
<i>dozen times. I'm not sure I understand the point.</i>
<i>[Miss Parker] Sydney didn't</i>
<i>always have method, just madness.</i>
<i>It was a psychological study</i>
<i>to determine...</i>
if the mind can enable the body
to exceed its natural capabilities...
when an emotional stimulus is applied.
Like when... when a car's on top of a child,
and the mother lifts it off with one hand.
Exactly.
<i>[Man] Miss Parker, this</i>
<i>birthday gift just arrived.</i>
Is today your birthday?
How old are you?
Oh. Young, I'm sure.
Jarod.
Know this man?
I've never seen him before
in my life.
Interesting.
It's a dead flower, Sydney,
not the Shroud ofTurin.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Excuse me for saying this...</i>
but it doesn't exactly look like
business is booming.
We've had some problems,
but they're all behind us now.
Problems?
I lost my partner
a couple of months ago.
Tom Miles? I saw the picture
of the two of you in the hangar.
He, uh, made a jump about
200 miles out into the desert.
- Tom was always testing himself.
- Testing?
He took one canteen of water, a compass,
and a knife, and hiked back in.
It was this... yearly ritual.
Uh, something went wrong
and... he died.
So all I can do now
is make Tom's dream...
of turning Blue Desert into the best
skydiving school in Texas come true.
We're gonna get
a new jump plane, redo the hangar.
Maybe even build a new
indoor training facility.
- Hmm.
- Tom deserves that.
It's not much to look at, but, uh,
the A.C. works. There's a phone and VCR.
<i>And for the most part,</i>
<i>it keeps the snakes out.</i>
- Well, I'm sure it will be fine.
- <i>[Horn Honks]</i>
What are you doing way out here
in the middle of the day?
Well, I had some business
over in Mason County, so...
<i>thought I might see if</i>
<i>you wanted to get some lunch.</i>
Meat loaf's on special
at the diner.
Unless I'm interrupting
something.
Oh, Jarod Cochran,
this is, uh, Sheriff Dwight Kunkle.
- Sheriff.
- Mr. Cochran.
<i>Jarod here is our latest</i>
<i>addition to thejump school.</i>
Huh. Where you from?
Oh, here and there.
Whichever way the wind blows.
How about that lunch?
- Well, I was just gonna show Jarod...
- <i>Oh, no, no.</i>
You two go ahead. I'll be just fine.
Nice to meet you, Sheriff.
Cochran.
[Starts Engine]
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>You're late.</i>
I've been waiting for you.
- Excuse me?
- I was told a traveler would come seeking truth.
- Told by whom?
- The sky fathers.
<i>What you would call a gut feeling.</i>
<i>They said you would need a guide.</i>
I don't understand.
See what I mean?
How'd he do that?
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Well?</i>
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>I ran his picture through the system.</i>
If he's any kind of Centre contractor...
then he's either been deleted...
or he's out of our clearance level.
Nobody's out of <i>my</i> clearance level.
- <i>What about this?</i>
- Torture.
- Torture?
- Jarod's playing games.
- Why?
- Because he wants to give me an aneurysm.
I don't know why.
It's... just what he does.
What about the picture?
I blew it up three
ways from Sunday.
<i>See, let me show you.</i>
<i>All I got is a street sign.</i>
<i>Black Ridge Lane. I don't know</i>
<i>if that helps with anything.</i>
<i>Maybe the location.</i>
Maybe you're right.
Maybe he just wants to torture you.
- Broots.
- What?
- Zoom in on that.
- What?
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>The reflection on the windshield.</i>
<i>[Keyboarding]</i>
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Again.</i>
<i>Again.</i>
- <i>One more time, sharper.</i>
- [Computer Beeping]
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Maine.</i>
I'll be damned!
<i>[Vehicle Approaching]</i>
Let me get that.
- [Breathing Heavily]
- Are you okay?
- I just lost my grip.
- Why don't you come sit down?
I'm a little dizzy.
Uh, can I get you something?
A glass of water or something?
No, I just need to
catch my breath.
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.
- Who are you?
- [Chuckles] My name is Jarod.
Angela.
I, uh, need to put
these things in the shed.
<i>No, no. Let me get that.</i>
- Are you learning to jump?
- Uh, no. Actually, I just started working here.
- You're the new instructor.
- You sound disappointed.
I just didn't expect Carol
to hire someone so soon after...
- What?
- Baby's kicking.
- He must not like the heat.
- It's a boy?
His father must be
very proud.
His father's dead.
The first rule of skydiving
is to respect your equipment.
Because without it, you die.
Do you understand?
[All]
<i>Hai.</i>
Now, the key to a safe jump is to
open your chute at the right altitude.
And we do that by pulling
the silver handle.
<i>We do</i> not <i>pull</i>
<i>the orange handle.</i>
You ready to give it a try?
All right. We're over the target,
and we jump.
<i>[Jarod] The ground</i>
<i>is rushing towards us.</i>
You are ready
to open your chute.
- <i>You pull the silver handle.!</i>
- [Grunts]
[Engine Winds Down]
I guess it lost somethin'
in the translation.
<i>[Grunting]</i>
<i>[Sydney] Benjamin Thomas Miller.</i>
<i>Single.</i>
<i>Runs the local</i>
<i>bed-and-breakfast.</i>
I'm looking for dirt, Sydney.
There isn't any. I don't think
he's even had a parking ticket.
- <i>[Sydney] Not him.</i>
- <i>Well, then why would Jarod lead us here?</i>
<i>He didn't. The little red notebook</i>
<i>was the Miss Parker Edition.</i>
Meaning?
He wanted you here, alone.
<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
What?
[Jarod] Let's see. It's 12:00 noon,
where you are.
I recommend
the Monte Cristo.
You can't beat a sandwich
with syrup.
It is a <i>little bit</i> fattening.
What the hey. You could stand
to put on a few pounds.
How would you know?
Oh, you never know who might be
peeking over your transom.
Uh, uh, uh. Setting back the bathroom
scale three pounds, that's cheating.
- What do you want, Jarod?
- Same thing you do.
Answers.
<i>By now, I would imagine that you</i>
<i>are staking out the Green Ridge Diner...</i>
where Ben Miller is finishing up
his usual lunch.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Diet cola, B.L. T., no mayo.</i>
I am impressed with
your eye for detail.
I can see I'm going to have to
secure my cell phone number.
Mmm. Those Centre operators,
they will transfer you anywhere
with the right clearance code.
You should look into that.
Yeah, I would. Except
I'm too busy chasing ghosts.
- Well, Ben Miller, he's more of a skeleton.
- <i>[Miss Parker] Skeleton?</i>
Check your closet lately?
Get out.
- <i>Excuse me?</i>
- Get out.
Try the Monte Cristo.
I hear it's excellent.
- Ready?
- <i>Hai.!</i>
- <i>Sayonara.</i>
- [Yelling]
- Ready?
- <i>Hai.!</i>
- <i>Sayonara.!</i>
- [Yells]
Hey. What's this for?
For lunatics.
[Wind Blowing]
<i>[Jarod Laughing]</i>
<i>This was awesome.</i>
You know, this thing would
work really well in the snow.
[Clears Throat]
Yeah.
<i>Carol Bates says</i>
<i>you used to be a skydiver.</i>
Well, I made a jump or two.
- <i>You miss it?</i>
- It?
The adrenaline rush. Pushing the envelope
and living to tell about it.
Well, sometimes that envelope's
a little thinner than it looks.
You talking about Tom Miles?
I took him up that day.
You know, the sad part is,
that was gonna be his last jump.
Isn't it a little difficult to run
a jump school if you don't jump?
Hey. This <i>school</i> has just
barely eked by for years.
Tom didn't care about any of that.
He was just a plain old simple guy.
All he really cared about was
his wife and that baby comin'.
[Sighs]
He loved this place.
He just wanted to have a chance
to share it with his son...
before somebody come along
and spoiled it.
<i>Expect he pushed that envelope</i>
<i>one too many times.</i>
<i>From what I understand,</i>
<i>Tom was a survival expert.</i>
He successfully made that jump and trek
into the desert a dozen times before he died.
Just 'cause you can do something,
doesn't mean you should.
But, hey, it's the desert.
Strange things can happen out there.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>So many lies, so little time.</i>
You need some soda.
- Who are you?
- Two Feathers, son of War Eagle.
Ever heard of me?
No.
That's 'cause everybody
calls me Ernie.
I'm guessing it's a peach.
- <i>[Ernie] How.</i>
- <i>[Jarod Exhales]</i>
What is it you want?
- I told you I was sent to be your guide.
- <i>Yes.</i>
The sky fathers who
speak to you from your gut.
Bingo.
- Where are you guiding me to?
- <i>The truth.</i>
I know it's overwhelming, but I'm
an Indian, so what do you want from me?
<i>Meet me tonight.</i>
- We can talk later.
- <i>Wait.</i>
- How will I find you?
- Follow the path of the iron horse.
- The what?
- The train tracks. Didn't you
ever see a John Wayne movie?
And bring some of that
leftover meat loaf with you.
- What meat loaf?
- [Wind Blows]
[Lamp Shatters]
[Exhales]
- Huh.
- <i>[Knocking On Door]</i>
<i>[Jarod] I don't know</i>
<i>who you think you're dealing with...</i>
but I'm getting pretty tired
of your magic tr...
I have to admit.
I've had warmer welcomes.
Did you see an old man?
Huh.
Never mind.
I, um, wanted to apologize
for the way I acted yesterday.
- Oh, it's okay.
- No, you're new here.
There's no way you could've known.
And... I'd like to
make it up to you.
- <i>How about a home-cooked dinner tonight?</i>
- That would be wonderful.
Great. Hope you like meat loaf.
[Door Creaking]
Be right with you.
Now, what can I do for...
I was hoping you'd come.
What are you talking about?
You look just like her.
Like who?
Your mother.
Thank you.
I'm sure this
won't take long.
Sheriff, I was wondering
if I might have a minute.
Mr. Cochran, I'm due in Dallas in about
three hours. Maybe some other time.
Oh, okay. I just wanted to ask
you a question about Tom Miles.
- But we'll do it another time.
- What about Tom?
Well, I understand that
you found his body.
- That's right.
- <i>Must have been a pretty gruesome sight.</i>
Body out there in the desert
for, what, three days?
- Four.
- <i>Four, ugh.</i>
See, what
I don't understand is...
why would a survival expert like Tom Miles
allow himself to die of dehydration?
What are you so interested
in a dead man for?
Well, I met his widow.
Seemed like a very nice lady.
Never mind.
Have a very nice day.
Oh, Sheriff,
one other quick question.
Was there an autopsy
done on the body?
Of course. Just because we live in the
backwaters doesn't mean we're backwoods.
Thank you very much.
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>She ate the whole meat loaf?</i>
Well, then it is no wonder
she can't find panty hose...
to fit those thick thighs
of hers then, huh?
- [Door Opens]
- Yeah. [Chuckles]
Oh. I'll call you later.
- <i>[Jarod] Afternoon.</i>
- Afternoon.
Buddy Slocum Jr.
I represent the southwest regional office
of the Internal Revenue Service.
I.R.S.?
I need to have a word with
a Sheriff Dwight Knuckle.
Kunkle. The sheriff's name
is Kunkle.
Sheriff Knuck... <i>Kunkle</i>
is in Dallas for the afternoon.
Well, that could
pose a dilemma.
<i>Buddy. Maybe I can help you.</i>
<i>Yes. As a matter of fact,</i>
<i>maybe you can.</i>
Do you have some information
on a Mr. Thomas Miles?
Well, he's dead.
Not as far as the I.R.S.
is concerned.
Well, thanks again, ma'am.
<i>[Angela] Tom was gonna finish</i>
<i>the baby's room when he got back.</i>
He must have been very excited
about becoming a father.
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>It was his whole world.</i>
Before Tom went off
on the last jump...
he told me how important it was
for him to be a <i>good</i> father...
<i>to teach our son about life.</i>
<i>He used to say that</i>
<i>life was meant to be lived...</i>
and death wasn't
something to be afraid of.
Is that why he made
those jumps into the desert?
<i>Carol's right. It's important that</i>
<i>his son know who his father was.</i>
- The things he cared about.
- Carol said that.
<i>She said that if the school closed,</i>
<i>then Tom's death would be meaningless.</i>
- Thank God for Tom's insurance money.
- What do you mean?
We're gonna use it to rebuild the
jump school. Hasn't been easy for her.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Because of the business?</i>
Because of the history
between them.
- The history?
- Carol and Tom were together
long before we met.
They grew apart, fell out.
<i>He used to say she was unhappy,</i>
<i>but he never spoke bad about her.</i>
I think it's nice that
she wants to keep his dream alive.
[Beeping]
- Just tell me you've given up.
- [Young Jarod] No.
Admit it to yourself
and I'll make this stop!
Not for me.
[Young Jarod]
I'll never give up.
[Echoing]
Never give up.
Mr. Two Feathers?
Uh, Mr. Two Feathers?
Ernie?
Oh! [Gasps]
Would you please
stop doing that?
I see you remembered.
Thank you.
Your meat loaf.
You left your hat.
Thank you.
Sit down.
Is this where you live?
You expected a teepee?
It's 43 feet of good living,
satellite TV.
I even get dirty movies.
- Compliments of Uncle Sam.
- Uncle who?
There was a question about a certain
piece of tribal land and who owned it.
- And this was your settlement?
- I would've settled for a new hat.
<i>White people.</i>
<i>I don't know how we lost the country.</i>
You told me before that you were
going to guide me to the truth.
<i>Oh, that.</i>
My family's lived under
this sky for over seven generations.
<i>I've seen many things</i>
<i>in the desert.</i>
Things?
I found the body of the man
who walks on clouds.
I thought Sheriff Kunkle
found Tom Miles's body.
It wouldn't be smart
for an Indian to ride into town...
with a white war hero strapped
across the grille of his motor home.
Why would a survival expert like
Tom Miles die of dehydration...
when all those yucca plants
were around him?
When I saw his face,
I knew what happened.
<i>According to the police report...</i>
the wounds on his face
were inflicted by an animal.
It was no animal.
It was his madness.
<i>I've seen it only</i>
<i>one time before in my life</i>...
during the vision quest.
Vision quest?
Ayoung man of age drinks
from the root of the belladonna plant...
in the hopes of
going to the world beyond.
If the mixture is wrong,
he could lose himself, go mad.
Belladonna.
Who else knows about this plant?
Anyone who's lived their life
in the desert would know.
I see your gut talks to you too.
Hmm. This is pretty good.
<i>Jarod worked the place</i>
<i>about a month.</i>
He was quite the fix-it man.
- He's a genius.
- I don't know about that.
But he could fix a tractor,
talk your ear off.
That fella was always
askin' questions.
I didn't come here
to talk aboutJarod.
Well, that's funny. All he
wanted to talk about was you.
- Me?
- He said you two had grown up together.
Seemed disappointed
when I didn't know much.
Guess your mother never
told you about this place.
No. She didn't.
She came here exactly
this time every year.
She loved the spring.
<i>She said she liked</i>
<i>what it did to the world.</i>
Aunt Dorothy.
Excuse me?
She used to tell me
she was visiting her sister.
<i>Ah.</i>
<i>I'm sure she had her reasons.</i>
When your mother didn't
show up, I got worried.
I never knew exactly how...
I was pretty young.
But I do remember that
her death was, uh, sudden.
Is there anything of hers...
It would mean a lot to me
if I could see where she stayed.
<i>[Crockett] Look here, Carol,</i>
<i>it's just not workin'out.!</i>
<i>I have to move on.</i>
- Once we get the new plane
from Phoenix, we're fine.
- You know I can't go back there!
[Rifling Papers]
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Tasco Sport Adventure.</i>
<i>[Jarod] I'm trying to put together</i>
<i>a vacation. You come highly recommended.</i>
Yes, sir. At Tasco Sport Adventure,
you get the vacation of a lifetime.
Bungee jumping and then golf...
<i>helicopter snow skiing in the Andes,</i>
<i>or shark hunting off the Barrier Reef.</i>
Actually, I had skydiving in mind.
You're in luck! In two months, we're
opening a skydiving school near El Paso.
<i>[Jarod] Well, that sounds interesting.</i>
<i>Very interesting.</i>
- Uh, I'll let you know.
- <i>Thanks for calling.</i>
[Tools Clanking]
- [Wrench Racheting]
- Ow!
- [Slams Tools Down]
- Piece of crap!
- Oh, come on, Crockett.
- God! Oh...
- [Inhales, Coughs]
- Plane only has to last a few more days.
- You scared me there, bub.
- Why?
Because you thought I was Carol?
She scares you, doesn't she, Crockett?
Or should I say Angus?
Angus Marin?
Who are you?
Somebody who found out
you're a wanted man...
and is going to use it
to their advantage.
- <i>Just like Carol did.</i>
- You sound like you <i>have</i> been
drinking that horse liniment.
<i>I know Carol's using Angela to get to</i>
<i>Tom Miles's insurance money.</i>
So she can refurbish
this jump school...
and increase the price that Tasco
Adventures is willing to pay for it.
I also know you are getting 25%
of whatever Carol's stake is in the sale.
What I don't know is why.
Is it because you know
she killed Tom Miles?
<i>Or because you helped her?</i>
This was her room.
<i>[Ben] I haven't touched anything</i>
<i>since she left.</i>
- <i>[Soft Chuckle]</i>
- What?
Looking at you standing there, I thought
for a minute I saw Catherine again.
You call if you need anything.
See, Tom and Carol come out here as
young lovers, bought this place together.
Only it was 60-40,
Tom's favor.
After they broke up,
he met Angela, and got married.
He was here for life,
and Carol knew it.
She wanted to sell,
but he could never get the cash together.
By that time, the place
had gotten so run down till...
40% of nothing's still nothin'.
And that's when the people
from Tasco came around.
Wavin' long green.
But Tom didn't
want the place destroyed.
<i>So, when Carol couldn't get her money</i>
<i>and get out, shejust shut down.</i>
Then what happened?
She came out to the hangar the morning
of the jump, switched Tom's canteen.
I didn't think anything about it
at the time. It didn't mean anything then.
But later on, after he died, I got
to thinkin' about it. When I asked her...
She threatened to turn you in
to the police.
She offered me a percentage...
just to help her get the place
turned around for the sale to Tasco.
<i>We looked at each other</i>
<i>andjust knew.</i>
Willing to hate each other long enough to
get our payoffs and get on with our lives.
Well, unfortunately for Tom Miles,
he won't be able to get on with his.
[Wrench Clinking]
[Southern Accent]
Yes. I'd like to order a slab of beef ribs.
Well, that's fantastic.
But I'd like them raw.
Yes, raw.
So, let's get this straight. If I arrive
in Phoenix first, I get the plane?
Well, I'll get there first.
- Have you seen Crockett?
- No.
Is there something wrong?
I just got a call from Phoenix. There's
another party interested in the plane.
They're gonna make a deal
with the first one who shows up!
Oh. Well, shouldn't be more
than a six or seven-hour drive.
I don't have six
or seven hours.
Well, I could fly you.
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm.
- How long till we can take off?
- Twenty minutes.
- <i>[Ben] How 'bout some coffee?</i>
- <i>[Miss Parker] Thank you.</i>
- How'd you sleep?
- Well.
Better than that, actually.
This place tends
to do that to people.
Sure you don't want to take
some of her things with ya?
No. I have
everything I need.
<i>Besides, this is</i>
<i>where she belongs.</i>
You were in love with her,
weren't you?
Your mother was
a very special woman.
<i>There was a part ofher</i>
<i>I knew better than anyone.</i>
But there was a part of her
she kept hidden.
- <i>Separate.</i>
- Did she ever talk about him?
No. She left it all behind
when she came here.
But... she always missed
her little girl.
I'll get you some breakfast.
Thank you.
- Why are we heading north?
- Weather radar.
There's a storm front
moving in from the southwest...
so I figured it would be safer
if we flew around it.
How long to Phoenix?
- About an hour, hour and a half.
- [Engine Sputters]
What's wrong?
We're losing pressure.
I think it's the fuel pump.
<i>This terrain is much too</i>
<i>dangerous to land.</i>
If the overflow of fuel should reach the
engine, the whole plane could explode.
We're going to have to jump.
- Jump?
- Jump.
Relax. We're skydiving
instructors, remember?
What the hell do you mean
he was polite?
You just give out confidential
crime scene files...
to anybody who walks in here
with a smile on their face?
He said he was with the I.R.S.
Damn it, Aida. I've
told you a million times.
- Police business is...
- <i>[Jarod On Radio] Alpha-Tango-997.</i>
<i>This is a Mayday.</i>
<i>I repeat, this is a Mayday.</i>
<i>Our aircraft is on fire.</i>
<i>We're going to parachute approximately</i>
<i>37 miles due north of Fort Hancock.</i>
Mayday. Mayday.
[Transmission Turns Off]
997... that's Carol's plane.
You call the civil air patrol.
Dispatch Search and Rescue right now.
Going my way, Sheriff?
[Grunting]
- Are you okay?
- [Grunting]
Ah, I think I broke my leg.
Hey.
[Grunting]
- Don't worry. Somebody'll find us.
- [Grunts]
I'm not so sure.
What are you saying? There's a chance
that nobody knows we're out here?
I don't know. I don't know if
the Mayday transmission made it out.
[Sighs] Well, what the hell
do you suggest we do?
<i>[Jarod] There's about six or</i>
<i>seven hours left of sunlight.</i>
If you travel lightly, you can
make it to Fort Hancock by dark.
- Me? What if I don't make it?
- You'll make it.
- [Sighs]
- <i>Head due south.</i>
And here's a full
canteen of water.
<i>Make sure you drink</i>
<i>plenty of it.</i>
<i>You wouldn't want to</i>
<i>end up like Tom.</i>
I'll see you soon.
Count on it.
<i>[Voice Whispering]</i>
<i>Carol.</i>
<i>[Chanting]</i>
- <i>[Voice Whispering] Carol.</i>
- [Echoing] Who's there?
[Gasps]
<i>[Voice Whispering]</i>
<i>Carol.</i>
What's happening to me?
<i>[Jarod] Same thing that happened</i>
<i>to Tom Miles.</i>
- Tom?
- Now, maybe you can imagine how
Tom felt those last moments.
<i>Dying out here, all alone.</i>
<i>Tom. Tom, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>You took his canteen, and you</i>
<i>poisoned it with belladonna.</i>
<i>The harder the sun bore down, the more</i>
<i>delirious he became with every tainted drink.</i>
<i>And every minute that passed was</i>
<i>just another agonizing moment...</i>
when he realized he would never see
his baby that he wanted so much.
<i>It got so bad that</i>
<i>he wandered in circles.</i>
<i>He clawed at his own body to fight off</i>
<i>the madness that you created for him.</i>
<i>[Echoing]</i>
<i>The madness that you created for him.</i>
[Breathing Heavily]
No.
It was a school
and a family.
<i>You took that away.!</i>
<i>You just gave it to her.!</i>
[Crying]
<i>Till there was nothing</i>
<i>left for me.</i>
So you left a widow behind and
a baby to be born fatherless.
Tom, I just wanted
what I deserved.
Something tells me you're
going to get just that.
[Cell Phone Rings]
Hello, Jarod.
With instincts like that,
you'll catch me yet.
Not if you keep throwing me
off the trail.
Oh, I didn't throw you off.
I just put you on a different one.
Is that all you do, Jarod?
Dig up the past?
That's easy for you to say.
You <i>have</i> one.
Although, it's not quite
what you thought it was, is it?
Happy birthday.
<i>[Angela] Okay, sweetie.</i>
<i>Let's go night-night.</i>
[Fussing]
Ho, white man.
Came by to say good-bye,
thank you.
Well, so long,
and you're welcome.
When we first met, you told me you
were gonna help me discover the truth.
I was kind of hoping
it would have been about myself.
About who I am.
We each take a journey
we're meant to take.
For some, it's clear.
For others, not so clear.
Am I going the right way?
Just keep listening
to your gut.
[Wind Blows]
[Mews]
- [Young Sydney] What are you seeing, Jarod?
- [Young Jarod] I'm not sure.
Come on, think.
Think, Jarod.
What does it mean?
These people...
some are angry...
some are sad.
- But all for the same reason.
- And that is?
Their trust has been
violated, Sydney...
by someone they look up to.
And now,
they can't trust him.
<i>[Sirens Wailing]</i>
[Shouting, Indistinct]
- <i>Captain Harrigan.</i>
- Are we clear?
O'Leary's still in there.
O'Leary, get the hell out.
That place is gone.
[Crying]
O'Leary, report.
- <i>What the hell are you doing in there?</i>
- Mommy, where are you?
<i>Somebody help me.</i>
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right.
Damn it, O'Leary.
Get the hell out of there, now.
Sir.
That's my baby!
That's my baby!
<i>That's my baby.!</i>
<i>That's my baby.!</i>
Gail. Oh, Gail.
Thank you.
Just doing my job, ma'am.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>So Mr. Raines loaned him to us?</i>
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Yes, Miss Parker.</i>
<i>You wanna tell me why?</i>
Bear in mind thatJarod's
modus operandi thus far...
has been to collect
newspaper stories.
So if we can establish
a correlation...
between his selection
process and his movements...
we may be able to predict his next move
by scanning the local and national press...
for stories
which may interest him.
And Cousin It
is your man for the job?
<i>Please don't trivialize this,</i>
<i>Miss Parker.</i>
His name is Angelo.
He's very special.
Oh, I can see that.
[Chattering, Indistinct]
Man, Jarod. You barely get your boots
unpacked, you're already king of the hill.
- [Chuckles]
- You know, I thought that place was a goner.
I can't believe you just walked
right through that inferno.
Well, I wouldn't recommend
trying it at home.
- Actually, it's safer on the job.
- Safer?
<i>68.6% of your serious</i>
<i>injuries occur at home.</i>
You run the numbers, it's a bigger risk
taking a bath than it is fighting a fire.
- The truth is, I was just following the exit signs.
- [Chuckles]
Hey, can you show me
where I can stow this gear?
Yeah, follow me.
<i>You take any locker you want. Just</i>
<i>make sure it doesn't have a name on it.</i>
- Any one but this one.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know...
Lieutenant Gleason?
Sorry, man.
I should have warned you.
That's Tamara Copeland's locker.
- The firefighter that was killed.
- Mm-hmm.
She and Gleason were tight.
I guess you coming here kind of,
you know, closes the door on all that.
- Or opens a wound.
- <i>Jarod, there you are.</i>
One day on the job with us...
<i>and you're kicking ass</i>
<i>like a 20-year veteran.</i>
I want you to take a good look at this guy,
Roy. Guts, brains and a touch of the crazies.
<i>That's what the Fighting 16th</i>
<i>is all about.</i>
Listen, Jarod. The reporters are ready
to get up close and personal with you.
Uh, sir, I don't want
any publicity.
Jarod, you are now a member of the best
damn fire-fighting unit in this city.
You should be proud of that.
Besides, it's good for the team.
Yes, sir.
Smile pretty.
[Cocktail]
<i>And how long are we going to have to wait</i>
<i>until your savant zeroes in on Jarod's location?</i>
Angelo is not a savant,
Miss Parker.
Actually, we don't have
a classification for what he is.
But think of him like
a sponge, if you will.
<i>He has no personality</i>
<i>ofhis own...</i>
<i>but he can absorb the personality</i>
<i>data that we give him.</i>
And he has read every
scrap we have on Jarod.
- So now he's another Pretender?
- <i>No.</i>
He could never make
a moral judgment of his own.
Also, he would never run away.
Where have I heard that before?
- Parker?
- Michael.
Come here.
- I can't believe this. How long has it been?
- Too long.
- What are you doing here?
- Short business trip.
I'm a sales rep for
a pharmaceutical company now.
This is part of my territory.
What about you?
I, uh, have a mid-level
position with a local firm...
<i>nothing very exciting,</i>
<i>I'm afraid.</i>
I cannot get over
how terrific you look.
Despite the lack of good sex.
[Clears Throat]
Michael Patrick,
this is Sydney...
<i>my assistant.</i>
- Michael.
- Sydney.
Anyway, I would ask you to join me
for a drink at the bar...
- but I can see that you're both, uh...
- Oh, Sydney was just leaving.
Yes, apparently, Sydney
was just about to leave.
Oh, great.
I'll be at the bar.
See you at the office, Syd.
Let's see.
I'm doing my nails...
<i>washing my hair,</i>
<i>smoking a cigarette.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>And you're talking to yourself.</i>
Yeah, so what?
That's what arson investigators do.
Jarod O'Leary.
I'm with the 16th.
Yeah, I heard all about you. You're the guy
who saved the little girl in this building.
Harrigan must be
doing backflips over you.
- John Zimmerman.
- Oh, I know who you are.
You caught the North Hills arsonist,
pretty impressive work.
Yeah, well,
it didn't get me any dates.
It's glory boys like you
that get all the play.
I bet you could
tell me some tales, huh?
Well, I do know this one about this little
monkey and this man in the yellow hat.
[Chuckles]
Yeah, I can take a hint.
<i>Nobody wants to talk to guys like me,</i>
<i>unless there's a fire.</i>
Then there's questions,
nothing but questions.
If you're so unhappy,
why did you pick this line of work?
<i>I didn't have</i>
<i>any choice, really.</i>
Most guys who wanna be
this close to a fire...
they either set 'em
or fight 'em.
I fall in the latter category.
[Groans]
- Are you okay?
- Oh, bum knee.
Sports injury?
Is that some kind of a joke?
<i>I didn't mean anything.</i>
- Do you mind if I take a stab at this?
- Feel free.
Well, we know that
the occupant was a smoker.
She was smoking a cigarette,
doing her nails.
<i>So my guess would be that she fell</i>
<i>asleep, dropped the cigarette and</i>...
- [Imitates Blast] ignited the fluids.
- <i>That's good.</i>
Real good. Also wrong.
- <i>Electrical fire.</i>
- Really? What makes you so sure?
Well, see, the outlet
was overloaded.
<i>The burns are mostly</i>
<i>concentrated on the walls.</i>
<i>The fingernail polish fluid</i>
<i>ignited much later.</i>
Oh, another needless
catastrophe solved.
- Impressive.
- Eh.
- You know, the saddest thing is...
- Hmm?
<i>this singed mattress.</i>
This is the closest
I get to sex.
Long lunch, Miss Parker.
Not boring for once.
- Any progress?
- Well, slow but steady.
Although I can say
with 90% certainty...
thatJarod is due to land
somewhere east of the Mississippi.
<i>Angelo has eliminated</i>
<i>everything west of that.</i>
We are definitely closing in.
You don't get out much,
do you, Broots?
Page me if you have
a breakthrough.
- Where will you be?
- Out.
What was that all about?
It appears Miss Parker
has taken a sudden interest...
in the pharmaceutical industry.
[Growling]
[Growling]
<i>[Roy] Don't worry.</i>
<i>Ember growls at all strangers.</i>
- How long do I gotta keep stirring this mess?
- Just until it coagulates.
That's a good word for it.
- <i>He thinks you're a dog.</i>
- He does?
Yeah, you're a stranger in this place.
He's just trying to establish dominance.
- <i>Really?</i>
- What, you never had a dog before?
No. I did drive a chimp
through the Amazon once.
[Chuckles]
- Here you go.
- [Whining]
He'll love you in no time.
Dogs are amazingly loyal creatures.
You keep their bellies full,
they'll do anything you ask.
Quit screwin' around with that stupid
mutt. We're waiting for lunch.
Coming right up, sir.
Now we know why you had to transfer
from your last assignment.
- [Jarod] Bon appétit.
- What is this slop?
It's optimized
nutritional supplement.
<i>Hearts of palm, wheat grass and</i>
<i>asparagus stewed with tomato.</i>
<i>[Disapproving Chatter]</i>
- I grew up on this stuff.
- Threw up is more like it.
- <i>[Clicking Tongue]</i>
- [Whining]
<i>People, there's only one thing</i>
<i>that can save this disaster.</i>
Insta-Cheez!
Haven't had a decent meal
around here since Copeland died.
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Miss Parker]
So he's on the floor. I'm on top of him.
We're both spent,
covered in sweat.
And you're still doing this?
At least three times a week.
Isn't it hard to maintain
that level of intensity?
Not if you're doing it right.
<i>Hmm, you're not doing it</i>
<i>at all, are you?</i>
<i>No, truth is...</i>
I gave up fencing after college.
Besides, I never found
an opponent as formidable as you.
Never will.
[Chuckles]
You still have
that look in your eye...
<i>half invitation,</i>
<i>half intimidation.</i>
So which do you want?
[Chuckles]
Don't tempt me, Parker.
[Chuckles]
Too late.
Uh, check, please.
"Aerosol cheese-like
imitation food product."
Official food
of the Fighting 16th.
According to these ingredients,
there's absolutely no nutritional value.
Hey, tastes great,
and it makes me sleep like a baby.
Well, I doubt I'm going to be
getting much sleep around here.
Oh, the beds are pathetic,
I know. You'll get used to it.
No, I mean, I've been going over
some of these old records.
- Boy, you guys are good.
- <i>92% knockdown rate.</i>
That makes us the most
efficient company in the city.
- I just hope I can live up to your standards.
- Well.
You follow Harrigan,
you'll be fine.
I watched him lead
a response with one pumper.
He put out a six-alarm fire
before the other five even got there.
Sounds like he takes
a pretty aggressive approach.
Except for these
warehouse fires.
The company arrived before
the structures were completely engulfed.
Yet each time, Harrigan
pulled the team back.
- Yeah, they were N.W.S.'s.
- N.W.S.?
<i>Not worth saving. Harrigan decided</i>
<i>they were too volatile to risk his men.</i>
Live to fight another day.
<i>Right. Look, Jarod,</i>
<i>you're gonna fit in fine here.</i>
It's like I said... you trust Harrigan's lead,
he'll take care of us.
<i>[Michael]</i>
<i>Nice place you got here, Parker.</i>
<i>[Miss Parker] How do you know?</i>
<i>You haven't even seen the bedroom yet.</i>
<i>And at this rate,</i>
<i>I never will.</i>
- How about a drink?
- Don't tell me you're tired.
I'm just getting warm.
I'll definitely
be wanting that drink.
I can't believe you let all this energy
go to waste on a sales job.
Don't forget...
if it weren't for that job,
I wouldn't be here.
When do you leave?
I thought you weren't
done with me.
I'll be here for...
two days.
Then let's not
waste any time.
Here we are, gentlemen.
Eat in good health.
- Yeah.
- <i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Hey, handsome.</i>
Nancy, what are you doing here?
I was in the neighborhood.
Thought I'd drop off your work shirts.
- You don't have to do this.
- I know. I want to.
Business looks good.
Oh, since breakfast this morning,
on top of which, Manny calls in sick.
Manny is sick?
Well, who's cooking?
<i>Hey, Herb.</i>
What should I do
with these balls of meat?
I think you two know each other.
I'll take care of the meatballs...
- <i>if you'll finish cleaning up, okay, Jarod?</i>
- Sure.
- Careful, it's hot.
- Okay, thanks.
Great guy.
- You have no right to be here.
- I came by to pay my respects...
and the cook called in sick,
so I offered to help.
- You would have done the same thing.
- What do you want?
A truce would be nice.
<i>Look, Lieutenant, I know we haven't</i>
<i>gotten off to a very good start.</i>
I just want you to know that I
understand how you must be feeling.
- Really?
- <i>Tamara Copeland was your best friend.</i>
I'm not trying to take her place.
I just wanna do my job.
Grab those plates, would you?
- You're not gonna make this easy, are you?
- What?
Me hating you.
- Thanks, Nancy.
- <i>See you later.</i>
I worry about that girl.
- What do you mean?
- It seems like she can't let go of what happened.
It feels like she blames
herself for Tamara's death.
It was an accident, wasn't it?
My daughter was
a great firefighter.
And I loved her more than
anything in this life.
But she knew this was
dangerous work...
and people die.
I gotta go check on
the meatballs.
Broots, another
possibility from Angelo.
Sydney, Broots.
I'm confident it's a landlocked state,
either Pennsylvania or West Virginia.
This isn't an exact science.
It's an experimental technique
with a huge human element involved.
- Been up all night, haven't you?
- Uh-huh.
Let me get you some coffee.
Maybe that might help.
- Oh, man. Who brought that damn mutt?
- Guilty, sir.
Well, keep him out
of the house, will you?
Hey, Hank.
Off with the shoes. House rules.
<i>That Italian slate cost me</i>
<i>$20 a square foot to put in.</i>
You heard about a king
in his castle?
Between that mutt and these slobs,
I'm gonna have to build a moat.
Cap's a regular Bob Vila.
He built the bar.
I'm gonna build
a garage this summer.
A remodel this beautiful
has to be expensive.
- Well, there's a lot of sweat equity.
- <i>[Roy] Yeah.</i>
- Our sweat, his equity.
- Check the hamburgers, Roy.
<i>And don't let 'em burn.</i>
Good kid. Can't handle a belt sander
to save his life, but he's a good kid.
You know, this railing...
1934 ladder truck.
The very first one
the Fighting 16th ever had.
Harrigan's used that railing a lot,
and I don't mean in the line of duty.
- [Chuckling]
- <i>You know...</i>
you landed yourself
in a very special unit, Jarod.
Historical is more like it.
This is the first unit in the city
with two female firefighters.
Yeah, with Gleason and Copeland there,
it felt like a real family.
- Nancy misses Copeland very much.
- We all do, son.
Must've taken a lot of guts for Copeland
to run into that burning warehouse.
<i>Yeah, electrical fire like that.</i>
That place must've been
hotter than Satan's armpit.
<i>Copeland was good, but she had</i>
<i>an overzealous sense of the heroic.</i>
I told everybody to hang back.
She thought she heard screams
and went inside half-cocked.
Really? That wasn't
in the papers.
<i>Copeland did outstanding</i>
<i>work on this team.</i>
I wasn't about to let her
be disgraced over one mistake.
<i>I called the hose crew in to bring in</i>
<i>a line and went in after her.</i>
By the time I got inside, she was
sucked into the smoke and flames.
- I never found her.
- That was very brave.
Truth is, bravery had
nothing to do with it.
As long as I'm in charge, this team
will never leave one of its own hanging.
You're not going to accept this
as a passing good mood, are you?
- I know you too well.
- Don't be so sure.
But I'm concerned.
Mr. Patrick seems
awfully transient.
What I do for recreation
is my business.
Besides, I like him.
Ask yourself this then.
Are there enough
healthy relationships in your life...
to compensate for what
you're doing for recreation?
These entanglements?
They're not free from emotional
repercussions, you know.
Let me give you a nickel's worth
of free advice, Syd.
You only know as much about me
as I want you to know.
And your concern,
though touching...
- <i>[Cups Clink]</i>
- is wasted on me.
I'll tell you what, Jarod.
- This is the best meal
we've had around here in months.
- Oh, thanks.
So how did you become
Martha Stewart overnight?
- Insta-Cheez.
- [Chuckles]
Actually, it was an old recipe
ofTamara Copeland's.
- Excuse me.
- Nancy, l...
Oh, man. I was trying
to do something good.
I think you did.
I think cooking one of Copeland's meals
helps to keep her here among us.
- We don't wanna ever forget her.
- No, we sure don't.
- <i>[Young Sydney] What are you seeing, Jarod?</i>
- I'm not sure.
Think, Jarod.
What does it mean?
Focus on the faces.
These people,
some are angry, some are sad.
- But all for the same reason.
- And that is?
They were betrayed by Amin.
He killed his own people.
Yes, and?
They could no longer
trust their own leader.
<i>[Young Sydney]</i>
<i>What are you seeing, Jarod?</i>
<i>What does it mean?</i>
<i>Think, Jarod.</i>
<i>What does it mean?</i>
- [Aerosol Spraying]
- <i>[Whining]</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Nothing like a Grinder at Herb's.</i>
- Now that will get you talking to yourself.
- They are good.
So, you buying me
a turkey sandwich.
If you're hoping
to get lucky, you're not.
Lucky?
- It's a joke.
- Oh.
Well, I was hoping I might
ask you a few questions.
- Figures.
- You see...
I'm trying to get a grasp
on this burn pattern thing.
And I have a bet with Roy that
this was an accidental electrical fire.
- Yeah, well, you better pay him.
- Really?
Why is that?
See the char trail lead from the middle
of the room, travels out in a web pattern?
All the flames are below
the electrical fixtures.
It's a planned torching.
Arson.
You gonna eat that pickle?
So if it was ruled
an electrical fire...
Whoever did it was a moron.
Hmm.
Well, I guess that moron
would have to be you.
<i>Because it was your ruling from</i>
<i>the Tri-River warehouse fire.</i>
You remember the one.
She died in it
trying to save your life.
You don't know
what you're saying.
<i>I know you checked into</i>
<i>St. Joe's Hospital the night she died...</i>
with a third-degree burn
on your back.
<i>And I also know that Harrigan let three</i>
<i>other warehouse fires burn to the ground...</i>
<i>fires that you ruled accidental.</i>
Insurance payoffs.
Is that why she's dead?
<i>[Herb]</i>
<i>Gentlemen.</i>
- How do you like those sandwiches?
- They were terrific.
- How much do we owe you?
- Hey, your money's no good here.
You guys are family.
[Zimmerman]
An empty warehouse goes up...
a mini-mall gets built.
[Jarod] Insurance pays for it all.
Nobody gets hurt.
That's the way it worked
until that night.
[Sighs]
All I had to do was...
spread an alcohol-based
propellant around the floor...
and bust a couple of pipes,
make it look electrical.
Once the fire was burning steady,
I started to beat it out of here...
but my knee gave out,
and I couldn't hardly move.
Is that how you got burned?
Yeah.
Flames were everywhere.
They caught my shirt. The damn pain
was so bad, I must've let out a shriek.
- Tamara Copeland heard you.
- <i>Yeah.</i>
I tried to crawl over to an exhaust vent
I'd rigged up to get past the fire crews.
But the smoke was searing
my lungs, and I collapsed...
<i>and I thought I was</i>
<i>a goner for sure.</i>
<i>Then I looked up and saw her</i>
<i>emerging through the fire.</i>
- She must've recognized you.
- <i>Yeah.</i>
She knew I'd done this,
but it didn't stop her.
She just went about her job.
Instead of saving her own life...
she started to save mine.
And then Harrigan came in.
He hit her with a crowbar.
Told me to get away.
Said he wasn't
going down for the fire.
<i>He took her oxygen and handed</i>
<i>it over like it was nothing.</i>
All she wanted to do
was save your life.
Instead she died
in that fiery hell.
Jarod.
<i>[Miss Parker Chuckles]</i>
- Parker.
- What?
Are we ever gonna make it
to your bedroom?
[Both Laughing]
Getting there is half the fun.
- [Phone Rings]
- Don't.
I have to.
- What?
- We have a confirmed hit, Miss Parker.
- Angelo?
- Oh, the guy's amazing.
He narrowed it down
to five clippings.
The winner's a place called
the Borodin Smoke House in Pittsburgh.
They confirmed thatJarod
was there until recently...
and his trail is
probably still hot.
Borodin Smoke House, Pittsburgh.
Get Sydney on the horn and get
transportation ready. I'll be right over.
Yes, ma'am.
Pretty family.
<i>Time to go see them.</i>
<i>Your business tripjust ended.</i>
- <i>[Knocking On Door]</i>
- Yeah?
- Lieutenant.
- Yeah.
- Can I show you something?
- Sure, come on in.
This is a duty roster.
From the night
that Tamara Copeland died.
If that's some sick joke,
it's not funny.
And if it's a reminder,
I do not need one.
You were supposed to work
the shift the night she died.
But she filled in
for you, didn't she?
It should have been me.
I know that you feel that way.
But maybe you could allow yourself
to see the other side of the coin.
They're more duty rosters.
From shifts you filled in
for her over the years.
<i>Nancy.</i>
We all know the risks.
You can't blame yourself.
I wasn't there for her.
Maybe you feel you weren't there
for her that night.
But you can be there
for her now.
ThatJarod Vronsky
was a godsend.
I didn't think we were going
to survive after my father died.
Did Jarod leave
anything behind?
Oh, he increased productivity...
restructured our investment strategy
and organized a dental plan.
All he asked in return
was to sit in there.
Now why would Stepford Boy
want to sit in a smokehouse?
<i>Jarod thinks in metaphors.</i>
He could be anything from smoke jumper
to sideshow fire-eater.
Oh, he loved smoke.
- Said he wanted it in his pores.
- <i>Mr. Borodin.</i>
Did Jarod leave anything behind,
like a red notebook?
Same as before.
I don't have it.
- "Same as before"?
- I have hams to stow.
[Speaking Russian]
I gave it to the other man.
- Who?
- A man came here less than an hour ago.
He knew many things
aboutJarod.
He said that the others would come.
The others that would want to hurtJarod.
<i>Broots is the only</i>
<i>other one who knows.</i>
[Cell Phone Ringing]
- What?
- [Broots] Uh, Miss Parker.
I got him.
I know exactly whereJarod is.
Okay, Ember.
It's showtime.
Come on.
You can do it.
- It's easy.
- [Whines]
Come on,
you can do it.
It's easy.
Watch.
Like this.
Come on,
you can do it. Come on.
- [Whines]
- Come on.
Ember, come on.
Come on.
Come on, boy.
[Whines]
[Barks]
<i>[Chatter, Indistinct]</i>
Anybody seen Zimmerman?
He's been paging me all afternoon.
Yeah, he just
pulled out of here.
He looked kind of
strange, excited.
- He say where he was going?
- No. Oh, he left you this.
- Anything wrong, Cap?
- No.
<i>[Harrigan]</i>
<i>Zimmerman? You here, Zimmerman?</i>
Why, you little bastard.
Harrigan.
Is this any way to treat a dog?
- What the hell are you doing?
- I wanna show you this neat trick I taught Ember.
- I don't care about that stupid mutt. Uncuff me.
- Hey.
He's not stupid.
He's man's best friend, you know.
And I've learned that
if you just keep him well fed...
he'll do just about
anything for you.
<i>His food of choice,</i>
<i>as is yours, is Insta-Cheez.</i>
It's not very good for you,
but, what the hey, it does taste good.
O'Leary, if I get out of here,
I'm gonna break your neck.
Then I better not let you out.
Now, about that trick.
<i>[Aerosol Spraying]</i>
Ember, light this place up.
Come on, boy.
Come on.
<i>Good boy.</i>
<i>Neat little trick, huh, Harrigan?</i>
<i>But watch, there's more.</i>
- What the hell are you doing?
- <i>Oops, electrical fire.</i>
Started by a dog.
Terrible accident.
- Put it out!
- <i>I'd like to, but I don't know how.</i>
You see, I'm not really a fireman.
<i>Oops, there goes another one.</i>
- Take the damn cuffs off me now!
- <i>Can't. Gotta make a phone call.</i>
<i>[Touchtones Beeping]</i>
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- Company 16.
[Jarod]
I'd like to report a fire, please.
16309 Ellsworth Terrace.
Thank you.
- [Ringing]
- [Beeping]
Well, I sure hope that
the Fighting 16th gets here on time.
The flames are spreading
pretty fast in these walls.
<i>But that's not</i>
<i>really a surprise.</i>
You see, I've treated the wiring
throughout the house with this accelerant.
That way the flames
and the fire spread completely.
And it looks like an accident.
No one will ever know.
- What about me?
- <i>Well, even the best arsonists make mistakes</i>...
- [Flames Building]
- don't they, Chief?
Oh, no!
- Give me the key!
- He looks pretty scared...
doesn't he, Ember?
I bet Tamara Copeland looked pretty scared
too the night of the Tri-River fire.
But she had you there
to back her up.
<i>Someone she trusted</i>
<i>to protect her.</i>
Go wait outside, Ember.
- <i>I'd hate to see you get burned.</i>
- <i>[Sirens Approaching]</i>
- Lieutenant!
- <i>Hold it, guys.</i>
There's something
you need to know first.
[Jarod] I've got to go now.
It's getting pretty stuffy in here.
O'Leary, you can't
leave me here to burn!
Why not? You left
Tamara Copeland, didn't you?
- Yes, I left her!
- <i>You left her to burn.</i>
So you could collect
the payoff money.
So you could buy
this Italian slate tile.
Or that 1934 ladder truck railing around
your wet bar that you're so proud of.
Yes, I left her.
Now, give me the key, please.
- This key?
- Yeah.
Sure.
Hope you don't burn.
<i>O'Leary.! O'Leary.!</i>
[Screaming]
My house!
That son of a bitch
burned my house!
Put it out.
Put it out!
Hang back.
This place is definitely N.W.S.
Come on, guys. I built that house.
Don't let it burn like that.
I'm your captain.
I'm your damn captain!
To hell with you.
<i>[Glass Shattering]</i>
- You must beJarod.
- <i>[Gun Cocks]</i>
- Who are you?
- [Chuckles]
Uh, you're really not
in a position to ask.
Now put your hands up
and turn around.
[Barking]
Good-bye. Good-bye.
Thank you very much.
I have to go.
It was very nice to meet you.
[Miss Parker] You cover the back.
Everyone else with me.
Who're you working for?
I told you, Parker.
I'm a sales rep for a...
Oh, you bitch!
You don't know the half of it.
Who're you working for?
All right. All right.
The Centre.
Mr. Raines.
Don't, Parker. Don't.
There might be repercussions.
[Groaning]
By the way,
I was faking it.
Hey, I can't eat this.
- I wouldn't give that crap to my dog.
- Oh, no problem.
I can fix that.
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

- [Man] Already checked Corridor 2.

- [Man #2] Anything at all?

- Find him!

<i>[Man] Well, I guess Mama won't be</i>
<i>kissing Santa Claus this year.</i>
Just tell me what you saw.
Hey, I'm just an elf.
I do what I'm told. You know?
"Be jolly"? Besides, I haven't seen
the big guy since the party last night.
- Oh, yeah?
- When are you gonna shovel him out?
Soon enough.
The meat wagon just got here.
- Don't you mean the "meat sleigh"?
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Hey.
- <i>[Cop] Evenin'.</i>
<i>Okay. Got a live one.</i>
- A live one?
- It's a joke.
Snowblowers must
have buried him.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Is that... Santa Claus?</i>
<i>Yeah. The red hat's</i>
<i>a dead giveaway.</i>
- Anybody got a shovel?
- No.
But I've got the gift wrap.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>Thanks, Gus.</i>
<i>Dr. Drake? Thesejust came</i>
<i>in from the mayor's office.</i>
- Same gift as last year?
- Smells like it.
Oh, well.
'Tis the season, Fugimora.
<i>Pass 'em out.</i>
<i>We'll see who survives this year.</i>
Yes, ma'am.
- Uh, so, how's the new guy doin'?
- <i>A lot better than Santa.</i>
- Drinking on the job?
- Actually, this was from the scene.
Dr. Jarod Marley?
Meet Dr. Lisabeth Drake, our chief coroner.
- Hello.
- Hi. You finished with St. Nick?
- Yes, I am.
- [Man Clearing Throat]
Detective Guerra.
Gee, right on time.
- <i>Now, can we do this?</i>
- Victim is not Kriss Kringle...
as we first suspected,
but a Theodore Hargrove...
58, stockbroker, played Santa at
one hell of a Christmas party downtown.
- Go ahead, Doctor.
- He died of a combination of factors,
mainly a heart attack.
Kim, I thought we were
going with exposure.
Well, that was my first instinct, but
further examination revealed the truth.
Heart attack makes sense. Folks at
the office party said St. Nick was doin'...
- one hell of a lambada that night.
- I don't know who "Lambada" is...
but, yes, lividity was
affected by the cold.
<i>But the blood distribution in the leg muscles</i>
<i>would suggest he was doing strenuous acts.</i>
- What about time of death?
- <i>[Dr. Drake] No way.</i>
We can't pull that off
in this weather.
Actually, that's
where this came in.
<i>The eggnog was hard when we found it,</i>
<i>but it wasn't completely frozen through.</i>
Mainly because Mr. Hargrove
had quite a bit of brandy in it.
- Oh, there's a shocker.
- <i>The milk had time to curdle.</i>
So I compared the bacteria
levels in the cup...
with that of the sample
that fell on the snow...
and I deduced that Mr. Hargrove
succumbed to his heart attack...
somewhere between
1:45 and 2:00 a.m.
My guess would be 1:48-ish.
- [Whistles]
- I ask for an autopsy, he gives me an eggnog.
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
Yep? Okay.
Dr. Drake? The delegation
from the mayor's office is here.
Damn! They're early.
We're done here.
- Career anxiety?
- Oh, you haven't met the mayor.
But, hey, he gives
killer Christmas presents...
<i>And I mean... killer.</i>
[Groaning] No, not again!
- Is this for <i>me?</i>
- Geez, Jarod, don't tell me...
you never got a Christmas present before.
Not in a very long time. Thank you.
A pastry with candied cherries.
It's fruitcake.
A cake with fruit baked right in.
Thank you.
This has to be delicious.
<i>[Woman On P.A.] Records Department,</i>
<i>please call the third floor.</i>
- Should we tell him?
- Let him discover it.
Yeah.
Mmm!
[Christmas Carol]
Jarod has been moved to his room.
As always, I begin my
Christmas hiatus tomorrow.
I'll be in Mount Pleasant
at the usual number.
It is the Christmas season.
But the Tower deems it best
to insulateJarod...
from the trappings of popular culture.
<i>[Young Sydney]</i>
<i>Jarod, I'll be gone for the week...</i>
<i>and I wanted to say good-bye.</i>
Why do you go away every year
when it turns cold outside?
Business, Jarod. That's all.
If you can keep a secret,
I brought you a little something.
A gift.
A gift?
- This is snow.
- Yes. Remember.
- Tell no one I gave this to you.
- Take me outside, Sydney.
- To see the real snow.
- I can't, Jarod.
- But I want to see it for myself.
- Enjoy this snow.
And I will see you again soon.
Okay?
- I got you!
- Aah!
[Laughing]
[Gasps, Screams]
Let's get out of here!
[Both Screaming]
Two kids found her buried in the snow
a couple hours ago.
<i>[Guerra]</i>
<i>Now, that's criminal.</i>
<i>Vagrant. After you thaw her,</i>
<i>check for needle marks.</i>
<i>My prelim is overdose.</i>
- I wonder who she is.
- We'll never know.
L.G.L.
Bag her and tag her.
And next time, please...
don't make me wait.
- "L.G.L."?
- Little girl lost.
No witness, no I.D.
Her family must be worried sick,
wondering where she is.
That's the tragic part.
She's probably a runaway.
We get them all the time.
<i>Nothin'to go on, so</i>
<i>she becomes a case number.</i>
<i>Like all the rest.</i>
- Are you okay?
- No.
[Electrical Crackling]
Fascinating, hmm? Only one twin is wired,
but they both feel the shock.
I don't even wanna know.
- Cleanup crew just came in from Cleveland.
- Any luck?
- Jarod's last life in a box.
- [Chuckles]
<i>You're the shrink. Maybe you</i>
<i>can figure out their meaning.</i>
Jarod's trying
to tell me something.
Makes a great greeting card.
But face facts, Syd.
At this rate, your boy won't
be home for the holidays.
Maybe not, but he'll contact me.
He has to.
- Well, it is Christmas.
- I worry about him.
- Out there this time of year.
- <i>Relax.</i>
He's probably holed up in Whoville,
experiencing the Grinch for the first time.
<i>[Bell Ringing]</i>
Would you like some?
It's called fruitcake.
Fruitcake?
I'm not that homeless.
What, are you
writing a book?
Um, no, not exactly.
- [Sighs]
- You miss him, don't you?
- Who?
- George. Christmas George.
- You knew George?
- I feel like I did.
George was
all the family I had.
Well, he was all the family
a lot of people had.
- <i>The children at the shelter miss him.</i>
- <i>Yeah. Foster kids, runaways</i>...
They knew the real George.
Oh, everybody thought he was a bum...
because he didn't have a home,
and panhandled to get by.
But he took all that money,
and one day a year...
he made sure they had
presents and a special meal.
Every Christmas Eve
he'd dress as Santa...
and read to those kids all night long.
That's why they called him
Christmas George.
Yeah.
When George was alive...
they all had family
for at least one day.
Christmas doesn't count
for squat without family, son.
No.
I'm beginning
to realize that.
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Oh, there you are, Jarod.</i>
I just wanted to thank you
for all the work you've done this season.
Without Christmas George,
it hasn't been the same.
Oh, I'm happy to help.
For a happy man,
you look perplexed.
Well, the truth is, I am.
- Have you read this?
- <i>[Chuckles] "The Night Before Christmas'"?</i>
- It's a classic!
- It's very good, but I'm a little
confused about something.
Now, if Santa Claus were to deliver
a present to every child on Earth...
he'd have to visit
830 homes a second.
Which would mean his reindeer would have
to travel about 700 miles per second...
and he'd have 1/1000th
of a second to park the sleigh...
to crawl down the chimney, to pass out
the presents and to eat cookies and milk.
<i>And for a middle-aged, overweight man,</i>
<i>that's quite a feat.</i>
[Chuckles]
Santa works in mysterious ways.
But it's so fantastical.
Why would anybody believe it?
It's Christmas, Jarod.
Anything's possible.
- Oh.
- [Laughs]
Angel, they're getting ready
to string some popcorn.
Don't you want to help?
Don't you want
to talk to Santa?
- He's not Santa.
- Is something wrong?
Is Christmas George
coming back?
No. No, he isn't.
Why not?
Christmas George died.
Do you know what that means?
We won't ever see him again.
Well, that's true,
and then again, it isn't.
Could I ask you something?
Why did you
like Christmas George?
Well, he was nice. And he made
sure the kids always had...
something under the tree
on Christmas.
So what you're saying is that he had
a spirit, a feeling, that made you feel good.
Well, as long as you have that feeling,
Christmas George is gonna be right here.
So every time it's Christmas, I can think
about George, and he'll be here?
Every time.
[Chuckles]
- Can I help?
- <i>[Boy] Sure. Come on.</i>
<i>[Violin: "O Holy Night'"]</i>
<i>[Continues]</i>
<i>[Continues]</i>
<i>[Dr. Fugimora]</i>
<i>Geez, Jarod. You've run 137 tests.</i>
<i>Any luck on the L.G.L.?</i>
- That's not her name.
- I didn't mean anything.
She should have a real name.
Her family should know.
Especially at
this time of the year.
You're not gonna
give up, are you?
<i>[Male Deejay] And we've got</i>
<i>more Christmas hits coming your way, so...</i>
<i>snuggle up by the fire</i>
<i>with that special someone...</i>
<i>and enjoy the holiday season.</i>
[Ringing]
- What?
- [Man] It's me.
I'm having a holiday
gathering at the club.
It wouldn't be the same
without my favorite girl.
- I'll be there.
- Very well. Christmas Eve at 7:00.
- European associates will attend. Be prompt.
- Of course, Daddy.
- Merry Christ...

- Puffer fish is only poison before it's prepared.
- <i>Kim.</i>
- Fugu toxin is 500 times stronger than cyanide.
- <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>
But when it's done right, all you get
are tingly toes and a great buzz.
Christmas dinner around here.
My fugu's a tradition.
The boys in the morgue love it.
And it goes great with cranberries.
<i>I'll stick with fruitcake.</i>
<i>And relax. My uncle was</i>
<i>a master fugu chef in Tokyo.</i>
- Was?
- He's retired.
[Laughs] Oh, good.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
- Uh, would you help me with this?
- Man, did you spill a whole mug?
Well, actually, I spilled a whole pot.
- I'll get you a duplicate.
- <i>Oh, no, no, no. That's okay.</i>
Just show me where
the old files are.
- <i>[Chattering, Phones Ringing]</i>
- <i>[Woman] It should take a few seconds...</i>
<i>to start working.</i>
Yes, I've already
dispatched the ambulance.
<i>Ma'am</i>... <i>Ma'am.! No.</i>
An overflowing toilet
is not a 911 call.
Ma'am. Would you please
hang up and call a plumber?
[Speaking With Mouth Full]
Okay. You need to... induce vomiting.
Yes.
Uh, no, your finger will be fine.
- <i>Yes.</i>
- [Man] It's not working. It's not working.
Your son is going to be fine, Mr. Hodges,
if you just listen carefully.
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Now, remember, clear the airway...</i>
- <i>and tilt his head back.</i>
- <i>Right. Tilt his head back.</i>
- <i>Now back to the breathing.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

- <i>[Hodges] Okay.</i>
- <i>Now, continue the up and down</i>
<i>motion on his chest.</i>
- <i>Okay. Five-count?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

- <i>My son is breathing.!</i>
- That's fantastic, Mr. Hodges.
They're here!

- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

- Hurry. You gotta hurry.
- [Operator] I'm calling it in, sir.
- Is anyone else hurt?
- No, they just hit him, and they left.
I didn't see no car.
- This is where it happened?
- <i>Where I found him.</i>
They just left George
there to die.
- "They"?
- I don't know. Crash woke me up.
I didn't see it.
I'm sorry.
I never left his side. Never.
Not until the coroner showed up.
- The coroner?
- [Sniffles]
Not the police?
Better directions, I guess.
[Sighs]
You know, he held my hand, and...
And we got to say good-bye.
You mean, he didn't
die instantly?
Ah, hell no.
He was a fighter.
Coroner tried to save him.
Gave George a shot
and everything, but...
Didn't help.
I never knew coroners
carried doctor bags.
Neither did I.
She did what she could, I guess.
But by the time the cops got here...
- she told them George had passed.
- She?
- Was she alone?
- Yep.
- And she had red hair.
- Uh, yeah.
How'd you know?
<i>[Woman On P.A.]</i>
<i>Any available assistance to the I. V. Unit.</i>
Why haven't you shipped the L.G.L.?
We need slab space for the holidays.
- I found stress fractures in her legs.
- Forget about it.
We've done our due diligence.
- Finish up the paperwork and send her along.
- I understand.
By the way, new guy
works Christmas Eve.
Don't worry about it. Last year was so slow,
we broke out a bottle of Christmas cheer.
Too bad I won't be here

Lower tibial fractures

- Media who?
- Bad ankles.
<i>From compression impacts.</i>
That, and she had callous patterns
on her hands like this.
<i>Parallel bars were</i>
<i>her specialty.</i>
Will you tell her family right away?
Count on it.
Hey. Good work, Jarod.
<i>See you around.</i>
<i>[Women's Choir: "Coventry Carol'"]</i>
Face it, Sydney.
It's almost Christmas.
He's not going to call.
[Sighs] I see you're clearing out
for your usual holiday hiatus...
so, here.
A Christmas present?
From you?
Don't go hanging mistletoe.
See you after the first.
And a merry Christmas
to you too, Miss Parker.
- Kim.
- Hey.
Hi. I was going over
last year's duty roster...
and I see that you were
working on Christmas Eve.
I was the rookie last year. That means that
this year, <i>you</i> get to wait up for Santa.
[Laughs] I don't mind
working the holiday.
The truth is, I've never
really had Christmas Eve off.
I wanted to ask you about the autopsies
that were performed that night.
- Shoot.
- According to the files, there were only two.
A homeless hit-and-run victim
named Christmas George...
and an 80-year-old woman
named Edwina Morris.
- Do you remember them?
- I remember the Morris woman.
Dead ringer for
Grandma Walton. Only fat.
But I really wasn't involved
in the hit-and-run.
I thought you were the only one
on duty that night.
I was, until Drake
came in with the hit-and-run.
She did that autopsy.
The chief coroner came in
on Christmas Eve...
to perform an autopsy
on a homeless man?
With karma like hers, she's probably
not that popular on the party circuit...
if you know what I'm sayin'.
The other body.
Edwina Morris.
- Was she a psych patient?
- No.
Just a very large
grandmother of six...
who died of natural causes.
- Why?
- According to the toxicology report...
there were traces of
phenotripticol in her blood.
- Phenotripticol?
- Yes.
Isn't that used to subdue patients
during psychotic episodes?
And in stronger doses,
it induces a state of paralysis...
<i>where the patient is conscious,</i>
<i>but rendered immobile.</i>
- Dead. But not dead.
- Oh, my God.
Please don't tell me that I performed
an autopsy on someone who was alive...
- and conscious!
- No. No.
- You didn't.
- Well, this couldn't have happened.
Someone must have messed up
the toxicology reports.
Or switched them.
On purpose.
<i>[Women's Choir:</i>
<i>"What Child Is This? '"]</i>
<i>[Ends]</i>
- You're Miss Parker, aren't you?
- I didn't know anyone was here.
- Please don't tell anyone I was here.
- No, wait.
Why did you come?
My mom lets me see the rabbits
when no one's here.
I want one, but my father
won't let me have pets at home.
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>We've been studying them.</i>
<i>There are three sets of twins.</i>

draws them together. See?
They're soft.

<i>Don't you love Christmas?</i>
- It's so Christmasy.
- Jarod, I thought you were working today.
I am.
But I wanted to give you
a little something.
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.
Open it.
[Sighs, Scoffs]
Fruitcake.

This actually smells good.
I was so impressed with the mayor's gift,
I tried baking one myself...
and I want you to be
the first to taste it.
[Sighs]
- Mmm?
- Oh, no thank you.
Mmm. Mmm!
It's actually good.
So, um, are you gonna see your family
for the holidays?
I don't think that's
going to be possible this year.
Are you okay?
I... feel a little...
My God!
[Retching]
Dr. Drake?
Let me help you.
[Gasping, Groaning]
My stomach! My God!

- What was in that cake?
- I went to great pains making that cake.
- It couldn't have possibly been the...
- What?
- Uh-oh.
- What?
Well, Fugimora has been teaching me
how to prepare puffer fish.
And I was practicing when
I was making the fruitcake.
And some of it might have
accidentally slipped into the batter.
- <i>Puffer fish?</i>
- I'm afraid so.
You idiot!
You poisoned me!
- [Grunting In Pain]
- I'm sorry.
- Call 911.
- Okay.

<i>No, but I am thorough.</i>
If I call 911, they'd be able to help you.
But they could hurt me.
- What?
- <i>They would come out,</i>
<i>they would see that you were sick...</i>
and they would realize that
I accidentally poisoned you.
And that could
cost me my career.
[Moaning, Gasping]
You can't do this.
- You can't do this.
- [Recorder Clicking]
- [Operator] Tell me what the problem is, sir.
- [Harry] They ran George down.
You gotta get somebody down here.
Lawson and Hill.
Right in front of the children's shelter.
Hurry. You gotta hurry.
- I'm calling it in, sir. Is anyone else hurt?
- No. They just hit him and left.
- [Clicks Off]
- You're a coroner.
Your business is dead people. Even when
you're the one who kills them. Right, Doctor?
Did you have a little too much to drink
at last year's Christmas party?
Can you imagine how Christmas George must
have felt when you hit him with your car...
and left him in the snow?
<i>He went into the alley to recover,</i>
<i>and you heard over your police scanner...</i>
that he was still alive.
<i>You couldn't have that,</i>
<i>could you?</i>
That could hurt
your precious career.
So you went back to the scene,
before the police got there.
Now, you didn't have anything in your bag
that would actually kill him...
but you did have something
that would paralyze him.
He was conscious of everything
that was happening to him...
but he looked dead
to the police.
He was just a homeless man.
You figured, no one
would miss him, right?
But like you always say,
bag 'em and tag 'em.
[Mumbling]
No. Don't do that. I'm not really dead.
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I'm not really a coroner.
[Voice Echoing]
But everybody thinks I am.
So I'm just going
to declare you dead.
And they can finish you off.
On the slab.
Just like
you finished off George.
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>
<i>["Jingle Bells, '"Off-tempo]</i>
[Voice Distant] Wow.
I never got to work on a boss before.
We'll start cutting on her after lunch.
Who wants puffer fish?
The effects of the phenotripticol

She's gonna wake up with a wicked case
of diarrhea from the fruitcake.
- Merry Christmas, Jarod.
- Merry Christmas.
- [Chuckles]
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
Merry Christmas.
He said to give you this.
He who?
Excuse me.
Dr. Marley?
- Yes?
- I'm Timothy. Timothy Ryan.
Gabrielle's brother.
I just wanted to say... Well, this
detective said you identified her.
- Went the extra mile, he said.
- I'm sorry that it took so long.
And I'm sorry that
you had to find out at this time.
I'm not. Imagine wondering a lifetime if
someone you love is out there or not.
Thank you for saving
my family that hell.
Thank you.

For 30 years, he just lies there,

It's all I can do.
He's the only family I have.
- What about your son?
- My son?
Yes. Jarod.
Jarod was here?
He stayed just long enough
to leave the gift.
<i>I don't know what</i>

I swear I thought I saw your brother smile.

<i>"'Twas the night before Christmas...</i>

- <i>"not even a mouse.</i>
- [Chuckles]
<i>"The stockings were hung</i>

<i>"And Mama in her kerchief,</i>

<i>"When out on the lawn</i>

<i>"I sprang from my bed</i>

<i>"Away to the window</i>
<i>I flew like a flash...</i>
<i>"tore open the shutters</i>

<i>Now, Prancer and Vixen.!</i>
<i>"On, Comet.! On, Cupid.!</i>
<i>On, Donder and Blitzen.! '</i>
"He sprang to his sleigh,

"and away they all flew

"Happy Christmas to all,

- [Children] Santa!

<i>Let's go in the other room.! Under the tree.!</i>

<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>Previously on</i> The Pretender.
<i>[Sydney] His name is Angelo.</i>
<i>Think ofhim like a sponge</i>...
<i>someone who can absorb</i>

<i>traits of others.</i>
<i>He will find Jarod for us.</i>
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He better, Sydney. Hejust better.</i>
<i>[Keyboard Clacking]</i>
Yes, Mr. Parker.
He's searching the Internet
for any signs of him now.
<i>We'll find Jarod...</i>
<i>and whoever inside the Centre</i>
<i>is helping him.</i>
<i>[Phone Hangs Up]</i>
Keep working, Angelo.
Keep working.
- [Explosion]
- <i>[Man] Whoo-whee.!</i>
You see?
Get too close to that bad boy...
and you'll be a-picking
your nose with your wrist.
<i>[Chuckling]</i>
<i>Now, you boys are 21, aren't ya?</i>
That's what I thought.
Fill up
their trunk, Eugene.
- <i>Now, where were we?</i>
- You were telling us about Mr. Nobel.
Yeah, old Nobel was like
a Picasso of gunpowder.
- He invented the Big Bertha, you know.
- The Big Bertha?
The mother of all Roman candles.
Three time-delayed sparkle explosions...
wrapped in a color-spray
smoke banger...
lined with quarter strands
ofT.N.T.
- Sounds impressive.
- Put on a New Year's Eve show...
that put old Dickie Clark
to shame.
<i>[Chuckling] I don't know</i>
<i>where he went. Just disappeared.</i>
- Yes.
- Hmm.
He has a habit of doing that.
Thank you.
There is no way thatJarod could have
known we were coming.
Zero.
Have you noticed that it never seems
to work the other way, Syd?
Maybe there is a reason.
Stay frosty, Nobel.
<i>It's all being recorded for posterity.</i>
This way.
The note that was faxed said
we'd find the bomb over here.
- <i>Carlson.</i>
- [Beeping]
Hello.
Oh, yeah.
<i>Bad Betty.</i>
Fax Bomber's usual.
<i>Whoa, cowboy.</i>
Betty needs her beauty rest,
or she's a real witch to wake up next to.
Tools.
<i>Whoa. I found something.</i>
- <i>Looks like a note.</i>
- He always leaves one.
What's it say?
"Catch me if you can,
you miscreants."
"Miscreants"?
What does that mean?
<i>[Rapid Beeping]</i>
It means "Get the hell
outta here"! Move! Move!
[Coughing]
Is it always like this?
Welcome to
the Bomb Squad, Jarod.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>[Chatter On Police Radio]</i>
So, Nobel,
now you know...
what a close encounter with
the Fax Bomber feels like, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Man, I wish
I could have been here.
Can't imagine why, sir.
- My ears are still ringing.
- Used to be some scumball
went to make a bomb threat...
they'd pick up the phone
like a decent human being.
Now what?
They fax 'em in.
- Scumball?
- Sort of like a miscreant, only different.
[Forced Laughing] Someone mark
the calendar. Lamont made a funny.
<i>Now, this bomber</i>
<i>faxes his threats in.</i>
That's a unique M.O.
Must help him cover his tracks.
<i>Well, this guy doesn't need any help.</i>
<i>We have run...</i>
every piece of evidence he's left behind
through the best technology we have:
D.N.A., hair samples,
fiber, impressionology...
Guy leaves us nothing
to follow. Nothing.
<i>We gotta catch</i>
<i>a break sometime.</i>
So you, uh... You people, you
stay here and keep after this.
I'm gonna go
lie to the press.
[Groans]
What's the matter, Carlson?
You catch a little more steel last night?
<i>Hey, Lamont, why don't you be a good civil</i>
<i>servant? Get the two heroes some coffee.</i>
He loves me.
Did you have another bomb
go off on you before?
I got a little shrapnel
in my shoulder during the war.
<i>Hero here's the only guy</i>
<i>refers to Grenada as a war.</i>
- <i>I got the medals to prove it.</i>
- <i>Come on. You know the only medals...</i>
that count in your family
are the ones your big brother won in 'Nam.
I heard that you brought the last two
of the Fax Bomber's devices in intact.
I got lucky. Hey.
Don't you worry about it,J.
<i>One day this Fax Bomber's</i>
<i>gonna slip up.</i>
When he does, we're gonna
be there to catch him.
I just hope the S.O.B.
blows himself up.
<i>[Man] The detonator was</i>
<i>connected to an accelerator.</i>
This is a dangerous new escalation
for the Fax Bomber.
Hand those out,
will you, John?
This is my sight profile
of the bomber.
It includes a, uh, computer-generated
composite sketch...
based on some
incomplete information.
- He looks like my Uncle Fred.
- Looks like everyone's Uncle Fred.
<i>Based on his, uh, faxed threats</i>
<i>and other data...</i>
<i>the bomber is a left-handed,</i>
<i>disgruntled ex-city worker.</i>
The chances are he's already
expressed his discontent.
- We all know what that means.
- Back to the crank files.
Excellent, Lamont.
Now, I expect...
<i>that all of you people will put in</i>
<i>whatever overtime is necessary...</i>
to screen those files and to interview
every possible perp.
Questions? No? Good.
Go to work.
- Excuse me. Lieutenant Chomsky,
do you have a moment?
- Sure.
I've been going over your file on the fax
bomber, and with all due respect, sir...
You know, when people say, "all due respect,"
they generally don't have it.
Sir, it-it's just that I think that
your profile of the perp...
is exactly who
he wants us to think he is.
I think that his grudge against the city
and everything else about him is a mislead.
Guy's here a week,
he's already bucking for my bars.
No, sir. I just happen
to have a different opinion.
- Based on what?
- I know people.
I'm listening.
The D.N.A.
and the impressionology...
all came up empty.
He's trying to lead us
down a high-tech path...
but I believe that we can snag him
with a low-tech solution.
He's right-handed...
but he wants us
to believe he's a lefty.
The verticals and the horizontals
are all jagged...
which would indicate that he's been
writing with his subdominant hand.
- You're a graphologist?
- Uh, no, sir, but I was a palm reader once.
Shall I tell you
about your future here?
Sir, I believe
that our bomber...
is a city employee who is not
necessarily disgruntled.
He's enjoying
watching us run around...
almost as much as he enjoys
setting off explosions.
If you want to suggest that, uh, this clown
is some kind of a Merry Prankster...
I recommend that you
talk with Rachel Newton.
Rachel is gonna spend
the next year of her life...
learning how to read Braille
because of the Fax Bomber.
- I wasn't trying to trivialize that, sir.
- No, no. I know you weren't.
You were just trying to
make, uh, an impression...
show off your erudite
European upbringing.
- My what?
- The cadence in your voice...
You were raised by a French nanny.
Well, could be Belgian, I suppose.
- How did you know that?
- Oh, I know about people too.
<i>[Sydney Speaking Foreign Language]</i>
[Continues]
<i>[Miss Parker] Damn it, Broots.</i>
<i>You said we had him cornered.</i>
But we did.
I don't know what happened.
- Jarod happened.
- Oh, spare me, Sydney.
All I know is
that I'm fed up...
with always being
a step behind him.
<i>[Raines]</i>
<i>So am I.</i>
- Uh, l-I gotta go.
- Stay here, Mr. Broots.
- What brings you down from the Tower, sir?
- Plumbing.
Plumbing?
I've come to plug a leak.
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey. What's up, Nobel?
The Fax Bomber,
a.k.a. Uncle Fred.
Okay.
Not my finest hour, but, hey...
nobody got a great look at this guy,
so the sketch is, you know, sketchy.
This is
a fascinating machine.
Yeah. This here is a Decatronics
Turbo Graphics II workstation.
This little bad boy makes composites,
puts disguises on portraits...
<i>ages missing kids,</i>
<i>which is what I'm doing now.</i>
- <i>That's incredible.</i>
- <i>Some of my best work's been</i>
<i>on the backs of milk cartons.</i>
<i>[Chuckling]</i>
<i>Think of the D. T.G. II...</i>
as sort of a high-tech
Mr. Potato Head.
- Mister who?
- Potato Head.
<i>Oh. Now,</i>
<i>this is interesting.</i>
You call him Mr. Potato Head,
yet his head is his whole body?
Yeah.
Cool, huh?
He comes with little
interchangeable ears...
eyes and little hats.
Old Spud Man is the original
master of disguise.
You know, this would make
a wonderful toy for children.
Hey, Nobel, crank file
just turned up a hot one. Let's run.
- Hmm.
- <i>[Doorbell Ringing]</i>
Oh, God.
What'd he do?
Curtis! They finally
came to arrest you!
- Curtis!
- <i>Busy, Ma.!</i>
Mrs. Haring,
we're not here to arrest your son.
I knew someday the cops would
show up and take him away.
- <i>Curtis.!</i>
- <i>I said, get off my back.!</i>
- Ma'am, we just wanted to...
- Thirty years old, and he still lives in my basement.
Day in and day out,
writing his little letters.
I should've bought
stock in Bic.
Don't say nothing, Ma. This is all
going on tape somewhere. I know it.
Listen to that. Do you know
what it's done to my social life...
<i>having him</i>
<i>down there?</i>
- You're not gettin' nothin' out of me.
- I'm in the prime of my life.
I should go out, get myself some
nice shoes and find myself a man.
- Ma!
- Sir...
did you write these letters
to the utilities commission?
And I'll write a hundred more
till they give me back my workman's comp.
<i>I got an inoperable hernia</i>
<i>working for this city...</i>
and they threw me
to the wolves.
How'd you get that letter?
What's your name?
I'm Carlson.
This is, uh, Nobel.
Hold still, man.
I can't see your badge number.
<i>He don't have no hernia. Hejust don't</i>
<i>wanna move out of the basement.</i>
Shut up, Ma! You know how my legs
tingle every time I sit for too long.
Yeah, and I know
where you're sittin'!
Sir, we're not here to talk
about your workman's comp.
We want to ask you some questions
about your whereabouts.
Hey, if you think you got something on me,
you come back with a warrant.
Till then, me and my mother's got nothing
to say to you miscreants.
<i>I should've married</i>
<i>a dentist.</i>
- At least then his teeth'd be better.
- Ma!
This guy's classic
bomber material.
Former city worker,
domineering mother...
basement workshop,
a little antisocial behavior.
- <i>I'm not convinced.</i>
- Huh?
He's written 253 letters
to the city and counting.
If he's crossed the threshold
into planting bombs...
don't you think he would have given up
the correspondence?
- Did you notice what he called us in there?
- Miscreants.
- Right. Nobody uses that word
except for that guy and...
- The Fax Bomber.
I'm gonna get under this guy's skin
before he hurts someone else.
<i>[Electronic Squawking]</i>
Wake up! Wake up!
Good morning!
<i>... five, six...</i>
seven, eight...
nine, ten...
- You can stop counting. You're here.
- Oh. [Chuckles]
You must have stepped into the room.
It's 11 steps to the door.
I did.
That's very good.
It's funny, Dr. Jarod.
I used to hate math in school.
Now my entire life
is basic arithmetic.
Nine steps from my bed
to the bathroom...
14 steps to the hallway,
seven steps to the chair.
Just be happy
it's not long division.
It's a beautiful day.
Why don't we go outside?
Oh, no. l... l-I think
I'd rather stay here.
Rachel...
you have to go outside
sometime.
I was supposed to work
in my studio...
but it was such a nice day,
I decided to go on the rooftop at city hall.
That's what happened
the last time I went outside.
You were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.
But that is not your fault.
You can't stop living your life
because of it.
I hear he set off
another bomb.
Yes, he did.
Thankfully, nobody else was hurt.
You know, when I had
my eyes behind a camera...
I could see things
no one else could see.
<i>I could take</i>
<i>a thousand shots...</i>
<i>and tell you which one was peryect</i>
<i>before it was even developed.</i>
I can remember details of nearly
every picture I ever took.
<i>That's ironic.</i>
They tell me
he was there that day.
That I must have seen the man who did this
to me as he was setting his bomb.
<i>But as hard I try,</i>
<i>I can't remember.</i>
I can't believe
they think one of us...
is leaking
information toJarod.
[Sighs] Oh, I wish I hadn't eaten
that poppy seed muffin.
They're giving us
a polygraph, you idiot...
not a urine test.
I thought it was both.
It should be,
for you.
What-What is that
supposed to mean?
You're the one who handles
the information around here.
I'm sorry. I'm in a filthy mood.
Let's not accuse each other.
Oh, that means a lot
coming from Jarod's teddy bear.
Miss Parker.
To calibrate the machine...
please answer the following
question untruthfully.
- Are you Eleanor Roosevelt?
- Yes.
<i>Have you pursued Jarod</i>
<i>to the best of your ability?</i>
- Yes.
- <i>[Raines] Become her, Angelo.</i>
<i>Tell me if she is lying.</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Did you willfully misfire your weapon...</i>
<i>when attempting to apprehend</i>
<i>Jarod in Miami, Florida?</i>
- What?
- Yes or no, please.
No.
Smoking is not permitted
during a polygraph.
Have you received...
<i>a personal message</i>
<i>from Jarod?</i>
It was a bunny.
Yes.
<i>Did you secretly contactJarod</i>
<i>via a secure Internet connection?</i>
Yes.
Did you attempt to provide him
with classified information?
Yes, but with a view
to bringing him home.
- <i>Have you ever secretly met with Jarod?</i>
- Mm-mmm.
No.
Is he lying?
Is he the one?
<i>Have you ever used</i>
<i>a controlled substance?</i>
[Clears Throat]
No.
<i>Were you in the lab when information</i>
<i>regarding Jarod's origins was leaked?</i>
Yes.
<i>Did you leak the information</i>
<i>Jarod received...</i>
- <i>via special courier in Miami, Florida?</i>
- No.
- <i>Have you ever lied to the Centre?</i>
- No.
[Gasping]
He's the leak,
isn't he, Angelo?
So, you've decided to put in
a transfer to Forensics, hmm?
I've just been sifting though
all the Fax Bomber debris.
You went over three thousand
pieces of evidence here?
Three thousand
and twenty-five.
- I've specifically been studying the wires.
- No, no, no.
The feds, they covered every
centimeter of that copper.
I know. I've been studying
the encasements.
<i>There's no pattern.</i>
<i>This guy is random...</i>
except for
the detonator connectors.
He's very sensitive
about them.
He wants to be sure.
That's why they all have exactly
the same parallel cut pattern.
Come on.
Exactly the same?
Exactly.
<i>Notice the angle of the grooves</i>
<i>on the parallels.</i>
<i>Gives us something to run down</i>
<i>with the knife manufacturers.</i>
- And the cut contours confirm that he's...
- Right-handed.
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
Low-tech.
- Very.
- <i>Mmm.</i>
- Hello.
- Hey.
Hey. How's the spud
of a thousand faces?
Well, I only have
the 13-piece set so...
technically,
this one's only got, uh...
One hundred and seventy-nine.
I have a project for you.
I'm up to my ears
in milk cartons here.
Well, this one's
very special to me.
<i>It's my mother.</i>
<i>I was wondering...</i>
<i>if you could age her</i>
<i>30 years.</i>
- I want to see what she would look like.
- <i>[Pager Beeping]</i>
- I'll make it worth your while.
- Hey, I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks.
- All right.
[Siren Wailing]
It's right over there under the bus.
It's right over there under the bus.
- Did the threat come in by fax?
- It was more of a phone call.
One of my drivers found the unclaimed
suitcase on the 3:15 from Traverse City.
- All right. We'll take it from here.
- Thanks.
Hey, can you guys
kinda hurry up?
'Cause I got buses backing
up on me here, man, and l...
Take as much time as you need then.
Thanks.
- <i>You okay?</i>
- Yeah.
Come on.
<i>[Buzzing]</i>
<i>[Horn Honks]</i>
Got a backache?
[Switches Off]
<i>They told me we would have a lot</i>
<i>ofhoax calls in training...</i>
<i>but I never thought</i>
<i>it would feel like this.</i>
- Let go,J.
- That's easy for you to say.
- It was pretty tense back there.
- Don't worry about it.
- That's nice work.
- Oh. Yeah.
- From my army days.
- <i>Let me guess.</i>
- You got drunk one night.
- Blitzed. [Chuckles] My whole unit.
<i>After Grenada, they stationed us down</i>
<i>at Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico.</i>
I do not remember one thing
that happened that entire month...
except for this
needle artist.
He was a shriveled-up little
Puerto Rican guy...
who had a hole-in-the-wall
shop in old San Juan.
- He inked every single guy in the whole platoon...
- <i>The whole platoon.</i>
You know how many eagles
this guy had to do in one night?
<i>Give us a break,</i>
<i>will you, Carlson?</i>
You partner with this guy too long, you know
his old unit like it was your own family.
<i>[Rachel]</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>
I'm going to turn this space
into a darkroom.
- I live in a darkroom.
- Good.
Because I need you...
to develop a roll
of film for me.
Oh, that smells
familiar.
- I thought you'd remember it.
- Is this some kind of new therapy?
Call it a simulation.
- Simulation?
- Mm-hmm.
I'm going to create
an environment...
with all the stimuli
you need to recreate an event...
and for you
to become someone.
Who do you want me
to become?
- Yourself.
- Oh!
Oh, my camera.
Oh, I haven't
touched this since the...
well, since the day
at city hall.
<i>Now I want you to develop</i>
<i>that roll of film...</i>
<i>the pictures</i>
<i>you took that day.</i>
- Oh, but there's no film in it.
- <i>I know.</i>
I want you to develop
the pictures in your mind.
I'm on the rooftop
at city hall.
<i>Natural light is at its</i>-
<i>its peryect angle.</i>
The building is... is closed.
It's Sunday.
<i>And I'm, uh, getting last-minute shots</i>
<i>for my gallery opening.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Are you alone?</i>
I think.
l-I don't see anyone.
I don't...
I don't see anyone...
but I feel a...
<i>a tingle</i>
<i>on the back of my neck.</i>
- <i>[Footsteps]</i>
- <i>I don't see anyone, but I hear something.</i>
- <i>What do you hear?</i>
- <i>Footsteps, walking quickly away.</i>
But, uh, you don't think
anything about it...
because you have
other pictures to take.
It's right
before it happens.
We can stop this
if you want.
No.
I walk over to where the footsteps
are coming from...
but he's gone.
Rachel,
do you see the bomb?
It's only an instant
before the flash.
- <i>Do you see him?</i>
- No.
<i>But...</i>
<i>I smell something.</i>
- <i>I smell</i>...
- You smell him.
It must be, um...
I don't... I don't know
what it is.
It-It's cologne.
<i>No, it-it's, um,</i>
<i>medicine, menthol.</i>
- What athletes put on sore muscles.
- Liquid heat.
Thank you.
- Are you Steven Johnson?
- Yeah.
Special Agent
Jarod Webster.
F.B.I.?
What did I do?
Nothing, Mr. Johnson.
I'm just doing a security check...
on one of your old army buddies,
Daniel Carlson.
<i>He put you down</i>
<i>as a reference.</i>
If you want to clear Carlson,
you're talking to the wrong guy.
- Why's that?
- Carlson talks a good game...
but the rest of the squad
had to carry him every step of the way.
Well, the way he puts it,
you were a very tight unit.
We'd probably have shot him ourselves
if he hadn't caught the shrapnel in the shoulder.
He has the company tattoo
on his forearm.
You don't see any moronic little birds
on me, do you?
<i>Hell, Carlson come in</i>
<i>one day all drunk...</i>
<i>queer little bird on his arm, talking about</i>
<i>how he wanted the rest of us to get 'em.</i>
Guy's a dangerous little
wannabe.
Well, thank you very much
for your time.
Hey, what's the little weasel
applying for, anyway?
- Bomb Squad.
- God help us all.
- <i>[Siren Wailing]</i>
- <i>[Jarod] You paged me?</i>
<i>[Man] Oh, yeah, dude.</i>
<i>Sorry Santa was a little late...</i>
but, uh,
"Ho, ho, ho."
<i>She's still beautiful.</i>
<i>Now, um, you said</i>
<i>you'd make it worth my while.</i>
Patience, Mr. Potato Head.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Jarod, the Fax Bomber
just blew himself up.
- Where's Carlson?
- He phoned it in.
<i>[Sirens Wailing]</i>
<i>Let me through.!</i>
<i>Let me through.!</i>
Let her through. This is her house.
This is her son. Let her through.
Are you hurt?
I wasn't home last night.
I had a date.
Curtis? Curtis, Mama's here.
Ma's here, honey.
I had a feeling about this guy.
I came over here to see if I could get him to talk.
He must have seem me coming
because the whole place went up.
- It knocked me all the way back
to the end of the driveway.
- <i>It was a nice play, Carlson.</i>
- Get yourself cleaned up. You look like hell.
- Thank you, sir.
I should have known
it was him.
Another croissant,
Miss Parker?
Cold coffee's plenty.
He always seemed to be...
a step ahead...
and then suddenly,
we were a step behind.
Broots has the classic
nonconfrontational personality.
<i>I doubt he would put</i>
<i>himself in harm's way.</i>
<i>[Car Engine Starts]</i>
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Where the hell is he going now?</i>
Private investigator?
Could he have found Jarod?
I don't know.
But somebody
just put themselves in harm's way.
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>
The same bomber, who was so
intelligent he didn't leave...
as much as a speck of D.N.A. behind,
accidentally blows up his own mother's house?
- Don't start with me, Nobel.
- And why would he keep all of
his bomb-making equipment...
in a box in the garage when he had
his own basement workshop?
- Maybe he was feeling the heat
and was planning to make a move.
- I don't think he's our man.
Why?
Is he left-handed?
As a matter of fact, he is.
The issue of guilt
is up to a jury.
Our job... collect evidence.
<i>[Alarm Chirps]</i>
<i>[Man] Now we have an exclusive with</i>
<i>Officer Dan Carlson of the city Bomb Squad.</i>
So, you defused his devices
and brought him to justice.
How does it feel to be the man
who uncovered the Fax Bomber?
I'm just glad this nightmare for the city
is finally coming to an end.
Not quite.
- Here.
- [Gun Cocks]
What do you... What is this?
What are you doing?
Sweepers? In my house?
- [Crying]
- That's all right. That's okay. It's all right.
He's in the middle
of the custody battle.
The P.I. was trying to dig up something
on the ex he could use in court.
- The plane ticket?
- Time for little Susie to fly home to Mommy.
At least
we've cleared him.
Cleared him?
He lied to the Centre.
- He never said anything about being married.
- He wanted his privacy.
- None of that justifies what we did.
- You're damn right.
You're late.
Well, I spent all morning on the phone
with a lawyer. He dropped my case.
Hmm.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Mmm.
Are you, Miss Parker?
Thanks to you, my daughter
hasn't stopped crying since last night.
Tomorrow, I have to send her back to her
mother, which is a place she doesn't want to go.
None of that has anything
to do with the Centre.
I work here.
I sold my soul to be in this place.
I'm not selling her.
So don't mess with her.
And don't mess with me.
Hey, Lamont,
what are you doing tonight?
- Hey, Carlson.
- What?
You'd better take
a look at this.
What?
Ugh. This is
some kind of hoax.
Now, we know the-the Fax Bomber
is in a hospital bed.
Well, I guess he
checked himself out.
Let's go.
- Main elevator banks.
- Right over there.
- Come on!
- Maybe we should wait for backup.
And miss our chance
to be heroes?
<i>Come on.</i>
Whoa.
Another Bad Betty.
Oh, God.
Let's not rush
into anything here.
Oh, look.
He left a note.
<i>Careful. Slow.</i>
"This time it's real."
Hmm. See?
- No!
- <i>[Bell Dings]</i>
<i>Forget it, Carlson.</i>
This is the express.
It won't stop for 60 floors.
<i>Oh-oh.</i>
<i>Sixty floors if we're lucky.</i>
- What are you talking about?
- Barometric detonator.
Designed to detonate
at altitudes 600 or 700 feet.
<i>My guess is we're good</i>
<i>for 45, 50 floors, tops.</i>
- We gotta get out of here!
- No, we've gotta defuse this bomb.
- No, there's no time!
- <i>Oh, there's plenty of time.</i>
<i>It should be easy for you.</i>
It's just like all the other bombs
you used to make.
- Huh?
- <i>You know...</i>
the bombs you defused...
- <i>so you could be a hero</i>
<i>just like your big brother was?</i>
- Who the hell are you?
Just your average,
everyday miscreant.
<i>And someone who doesn't think that</i>
<i>Rachel Newton should have lost her eyesight...</i>
so that you could be
put in the limelight.
Now, listen to meJarod.
I did not expect anybody to get hurt.
Tell that to Curtis Haring.
He was the guy you tried to blow up...
so you could
cover your tracks.
All right! That's enough!
Now, come on! Defuse this thing!
Not so cool under pressure
when it's not your own bomb.
<i>But you see, people that plant bombs,</i>
<i>they're cowards at heart.</i>
And since I planted this one, I don't
want to stick around to watch it blow.
- <i>[Bell Dings]</i>
- Uh-oh.
Twentieth floor.
Better get to work.
Hope you can figure out
which wire to snip.
Bye-bye, hero.
No! Jarod!
Jarod!
[Beeping]
<i>[Thudding]</i>
I guess that's why
they call it the express.
<i>[Rapid Beeping]</i>
<i>[Electronic Male Voice]</i>
<i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>
<i>seven, six...</i>
<i>five, four...</i>
<i>three, two...</i>
<i>one.</i>
<i>Kaboom.</i>
You're under arrest,
Carlson.
<i>[Curtis]</i>
<i>... that all of you at city hall...</i>
will pay egregiously
for what has happened to me.
- Are you sure you want to say that?
- Say what?
- "Egregiously"?
- Who's writing this letter?
- I was only making a suggestion.
- It's my letter!
- All right, already. What do you want from me?
- Ma!
- You don't even know what it means.
- Do too!
- Well, I can spell it.
- Just write it!
- <i>E, G, R</i>...
- <i>Get my dictionary.!</i>
- I'm not going in that smelly basement.
- Ohh! There's a fly on me.
- "Egregiously."
- A fly on me! Aah!
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Morning, May.</i>
- <i>Where's Rachel?</i>
- There's something you should see.
<i>Took her about a halfhour</i>
<i>to get down there.</i>
<i>But she got there</i>
<i>all by herself.</i>
<i>He's still searching,</i>
<i>Mr. Parker.</i>
But we will
find the leak.
<i>I promise you that.</i>
<i>Did you find</i>
<i>something, Angelo?</i>
Keep working.
Keep working.
<i>[Keyboard Clacking]</i>
[Mews]
<i>The deceased is not to be picked up</i>
<i>until this coming Saturday?</i>
Yes, just after dawn. Um, details
for the arrangements are all there.
<i>And a choice of casket</i>
<i>and cemetery.</i>
<i>I would prefer a quiet service.</i>
Of course, Miss Will.
The deceased was your father?
<i>Is</i> my father.
If your father
is still alive, then why...
Just have a casket ready
Saturday morning.
Please.
[Engine Starts]
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>I don't wanna die.</i>
But I know it's too late
to change any of that.
[Young Sydney]
There's nothing you wanna confess?
[Young Jarod]
You keep asking me for the truth...
when that's all
I've ever given you.
[Young Sydney] Even in the face
of death, you maintain your innocence.
Yes.
He's innocent, Sydney.
An innocent man is going to die.
<i>[Man] Off the bus.!</i>
<i>Move it.! Move it.! Move it.!</i>
<i>You heard the man, side by side.!</i>
<i>Line up and shut up.!</i>
<i>Let's go.! Move it.!</i>
Welcome to Oakfield
Penitentiary, gentlemen.
Sound off.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>[Sydney] There's been a breakthrough</i>
<i>concerning Jarod's next destination.</i>
"Top Hat Café pay phone.
January, weekend of the 15th...
meeting with cowboy
regarding Parker brothers."
I don't have a brother,
do I, Sydney?
That I don't know.
What we do know is the 15th
is this coming weekend...
and that note is distinctly
written in Jarod's hand.
- Cleanup team find this?
- In Jarod's last lair...
stuck in the toilet pipe
after having been flushed.
Okay, the arrangements
are all set, Sydney.
<i>Uh, oh, uh</i>...
Go on, Broots.
What arrangements?
Mr. Broots
will be joining us.
<i>Uh, the director thinks</i>
<i>a little technical support might help.</i>
<i>Technical support?</i>
<i>Well, she thinks that some details</i>
<i>are getting overlooked...</i>
that you and Sydney are maybe a little
too emotionally involved with Jarod.
And you're the fix?
Well...
[Snickers]
<i>An</i>...<i>An objective eye, maybe.</i>
Uh, I'll get the car.
[Whistling]
Duller than hockey
in September.
<i>[Man] Never forget,</i>
<i>Mr. Bradley, that in this place...</i>
<i>we are dealing strictly with</i>
<i>a mentality of desperation.</i>
A desperation born from being
locked down in a 10-by-10 cell...
for 20, 30 years,
sometimes longer.
I would say that desperation
was a good word for that, sir.
A man's fiber, if he had any
to begin with, quickly frays.
<i>It's yourjob to keep</i>
<i>those frayed ends knotted.</i>
You're here because
of your experience under duress.
With the Carl Will execution on Saturday,
there promises to be plenty of that.
Sounds like he's got all the classic
symptoms of a career criminal.
Carl Will has a criminal record
dating back 30 years.
Car theft, armed robbery...
a dozen other felony violations leading to
the brutal murder of a fellow inmate.
You worked Folsom
during the '91 inmate riot.
I'm proud to say that we squelched
that one with extreme prejudice.
We don't wipe noses.
We don't lend shoulders to cry on.
We manage, Mr. Bradley, with,
as you say, extreme prejudice.
I'm sure the execution will send
a message to the entire population.
That's the idea.
<i>He's not in there, and none</i>
<i>of the locals have seen him.</i>
- Mm-hmm.
- [Clears Throat]
Maybe we should stake him out.
They didn't let you
have a weapon, did they?
No.
And where do you propose
we do our stakeout?
Right there.
<i>[Man] So, Jarod, how many men</i>
<i>did they run on a shift at Folsom?</i>
Oh, we had a crew of 35 during the week,
slightly less on the weekends.
I hear Warden Harper's
a tough man.
His name is Hopkins.
- Right, Hopkins.
- Morris.
<i>Ah, Jarod Bradley,</i>
<i>Tommy Larson.</i>
Bradley.
The guy from Folsom?
- And all points west.
- Tommy can show you around.
Uh, keep both eyes open.
The animals are getting restless.
Let me take you out,
show you the main yard.
<i>Most of the population</i>
<i>spends four or five hours a day here.</i>
Different zoo, same routine.
Gotta make sure they don't kill each other
and herd 'em in at the bell.
Seems tense.
Yeah, well, it'll ease up
after the, uh, the event.
- The event?
- Execution.
You get it up close and personal.
New guy gets death watch.
- Why me?
- <i>I don't know how it was at Folsom...</i>
but around here, it's considered bad luck
to get too close to a condemned man.
They make the new guy do it.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Walkin'through.</i>
Is that him?
<i>[Buzzer Buzzes]</i>
- Larson.
- What?
Is that the man
they're going to kill?
Yeah, that's him.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>What do you mean you're booked up?</i>
Who the hell would purposely stay...
at the Park Place Motel?
Well, we got a convention. The electric
company booked the entire facility.
- Do you know this man?
- Jarod.
Yeah, he comes through here
every now and then.
Matter of fact, he said something
about passing through this weekend.
Got a meeting or something.
I'll tell you what.
You being friends of his and all,
you and your brother and... and your dad...
you can stay in the celebrity room
that I keep open for special guests.
Celebrity room.
Burl Ives stayed here once.
We even had Mama Cass.
Not to mention
that Osmond boy.
You know, the goofy-looking one
with the... the big ears.
You know, I bet it wasn't Donny.
Mail call for inmate Cockran.
Thanks.
Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't watching
where I was going.
You okay, boss?
I'm fine.
And the name is Jarod, Mr...
Cockran, Henry.
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Henry.
<i>[Buzzer Buzzes]</i>
- You're new around here.
- Yes, I am.
- And you?
- Oh, I've been walking these halls for 27 years.
<i>That's a long time.</i>
There isn't a cockroach
I'm not on a first name basis with.
- Is that mail from home?
- Uh, my wife.
She writes me every week
like clockwork.
Sends me seeds for my garden.
These should be marigolds.
<i>Cockran.</i>
<i>You got somewhere</i>
<i>to be, old-timer?</i>
Kitchen, boss.
That what they call
extreme prejudice at Folsom?
You have to know your enemy.
[Male Reporter]
Tonight we bring you a story of love, law...
<i>and its connection between</i>
<i>a man on death row...</i>
<i>and a daughter whose life</i>
<i>has been a fight to free him.</i>
Ten years ago, Carl Will,
a career criminal...
<i>was sentenced to five years</i>
<i>for car theft.</i>
<i>Only weeks away from parole,</i>
<i>he was involved in a bloody altercation...</i>
inside Oakfield Penitentiary, in which inmate
Anthony Lewis was stabbed to death.
<i>After a speedy trial conducted</i>
<i>by then state attorney...</i>
<i>and present governor</i>
<i>Charles Edwards...</i>
<i>Will was convicted</i>
<i>of first-degree murder...</i>
<i>and sentenced to die</i>
<i>in the gas chamber...</i>
<i>which is where the story</i>
<i>takes a most unusual turn.</i>
<i>At the time of Will's initial arrest,</i>
<i>his daughterJessica was a senior in high school.</i>
<i>Jessica's belief in her father fueled her</i>
<i>to spend the next seven years...</i>
<i>in college and law school, and every day</i>
<i>since, fighting to free her father.</i>
<i>But with the governor's denying</i>
<i>final appeal...</i>
<i>and the execution scheduled</i>
<i>for midnight Friday...</i>
<i>her odyssey oflaw and love</i>
<i>appears to be at an end.</i>
<i>[Jessica's Voice]</i>
<i>I love my father, I believe in him...</i>
<i>and I will never stop fighting.</i>
How do you respond toJessica Will's
call for clemency from the governor?
The governor's refusal
is the only answer I need.
Miss Will calls the quick processing
of her father...
a political act by Governor Edwards based on
his reelection law and order platform.
- How do you answer that?
- No one doubts Miss Will's love
or devotion to her father...
but she is working from emotion,
and we're working from fact.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Warden, what facts are those?</i>
Officers Clancy and Larson found Carl Will
next to the body of Anthony Lewis...
holding the murder weapon.
Unfortunate as it is, when you concentrate
transgressors in the system...
these things happen, but they won't be
tolerated by me or the governor.
The time has come for us to do our job,
and we're going to do it at dawn Saturday.
- Thank you.
- [Reporters Clamoring]
<i>[Buzzer Buzzing]</i>
<i>Didn't you hear it's bad luck</i>
<i>being around a dead man?</i>
Well, I'm the new guy.
I have no choice.
- <i>Bon appétit.</i>
- <i>I'm not hungry.</i>
It's grilled porterhouse steak,
medium rare.
Poached snap beans.
That's what I ordered
for my last meal.
I know.
That wasn't supposed to be
for, uh, two days.
Well, it's your favorite.
I figured why wait.
They move in on you, don't they?
The walls.
You stare at them long enough, and you
swear they start creeping in on you.
You sound like a man that's
been on this side of the bars.
It's tough...
when you don't belong there.
You're innocent...
at least that's what
you keep saying.
Nobody's listening.
I am.
You're telling me a man wearing
that uniform hasn't heard this story?
I've heard the story.
I'm interested in the truth.
I was headed back to Block "C"
from laundry detail.
I heard voices.
Some people struggling
down the gantry.
Turned around to see
what the commotion was.
Got knocked out.
Woke up in this nightmare.
Corn bread or fritters?
Fritters.
Just like you asked.
Just the wayJessica asked.
She arranged all this.
She loves you very much.
Bradley.
The prisoner's meal is delivered.
<i>[Over Listening Device]</i>
<i>Oh, darlin', I miss you so damn bad.</i>
<i>I ache all over thinking how pretty</i>
<i>you looked laying in that bathtub.</i>
<i>That Mr. Bubble dancing</i>
<i>on your skin like a love potion.</i>
<i>And you stood up and I drank</i>
<i>in the vision of your peryectly shaped</i>...
<i>[Turns Off Device]</i>
[Clears Throat]
Phone tap seems to be working.
I guess I'll poke around
the room for signs ofJarod.
I'm going to go
out of my mind.
<i>You're welcome to borrow</i>
<i>one of my books if you want.</i>
<i>You're welcome to borrow</i>
<i>one of my books if you want.</i>
<i>"Relative Thinking. '"</i>
<i>"The Inner Mind. '"</i>
My God! Sydney, is Jarod
all you think about?
Because you don't?
- There is a lot more to life than Jarod.
- Such as?
Such as fun.
Such as sex.
Interesting that in a conversation
aboutJarod, you mention sex.
Well, nothing in the toilet.
How long has it been since
you've been with a woman, Sydney?
<i>Sydney's private life</i>
<i>is not a subject for public discussion.</i>
Well, it's not healthy, you know, keeping
all of that animal emotion bottled up.
Next thing you know, you'll be
on the roof with a rifle in your hands.
You know, I've been
seeing a woman.
Really. Broots.
Tell us about her.
There's not much to tell really.
We... We met online.
You pick up women
on the computer?
How romantic. Details.
<i>Well, uh, she's an accountant.</i>
She has three dogs and a bird.
And, uh, oh!
And she's a hugeJohn Tesh fan.
Sounds like a real wildcat.
What's she look like?
You know, I think, uh,
I should start dusting for prints.
We haven't actually met... yet.
You are pathetic.
God, can they make it
any hotter in here?
<i>[Miss Parker Groaning]</i>
- <i>[Sydney] You all right, Miss Parker?</i>
- I'm okay.
It's this, uh, swill
from that greasy spoon.
<i>How much more exciting</i>
<i>can this get?</i>
Look, Monopoly.
<i>[Country]</i>
Psst. Psst.
<i>Yeah, it's amazing</i>
<i>what they let sit down in this place.</i>
<i>Mm, you smell something?</i>
[Sniffing]
Smells like somebody's
about to fry.
Would you just
leave me alone? Please.
- What you gonna do if I don't? Huh?
- [Door Bells Ring]
Pull out one of them knives
like your daddy did?
<i>Stick me with it?</i>
<i>Jessica. Hi, honey.</i>
<i>Sorry I'm late.</i>
<i>Traffic was a bear.</i>
You will excuse us,
won't you, gentlemen?
- Thank you.
- Bet that's happening a lot these days.
You have no idea.
You're a guard from the prison.
- I'm off duty.
- It's nothing personal...
but it's just guards aren't high
on my list of dinner companions.
I just shared a meal
with your father.
He misses you very much.
Why are you here?
Fate.
And I don't think
your father deserves his.
My mother left when I was little,
but he never left me.
We lived in this rusted-out Airstream
for most of my life.
You know, we didn't have much...
but he always made sure
I had what I needed.
Look, I'm not saying that my father
is the epitome of virtue.
I mean, he was... he was pretty wild
when he was younger.
But stealing cars
and committing murder...
are worlds apart.
He spent five years
in that lockup.
He was a week away
from parole.
He had a job on the outside...
and I was on the outside.
He wouldn't have done that to me.
Did you know Monopoly
was developed by Charles Darrow...
an unemployed heating engineer
from Germantown, Pennsylvania in 1935?
Yeah, that's fascinating.
The game was originally rejected
for containing 52 fundamental errors...
<i>but there still have been</i>
<i>over 100 million sets sold worldwide.</i>
You sound like quite an expert
on the subject.
Monopoly club, high school.
What a surprise.
[Groans]
Miss Parker, you all right?
It's just so damn hot in here.
<i>You know</i>...<i>[Clears Throat]</i>
<i>there's something wrong with this game.</i>
[Grunts] There's something wrong
with this whole damn thing.
<i>No, there's, uh</i>...<i>[Clears Throat]</i>
<i>there's something missing here.</i>
[Grunts]
The only thing missing is Jarod.
- [Groans]
- Miss Parker!
<i>Get a doctor now.!</i>
[Computer Beeps]
[Beeps]
[Beeps]
<i>[Beeps]</i>
[Inmates Chattering]
Narcissus.
I call them daffodils.
They're my wife's favorite.
Well, I can see why.
They're beautiful.
<i>Talk like that, and no one</i>
<i>will believe you're really a bull.</i>
<i>Only thing the other guards</i>
<i>know how to grow is resentment.</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Walkin'through.</i>
Is it always this tense around here
before an execution?
Always.
Did you know Anthony Lewis?
No. He'd only been here
a couple of days.
Couple of days?
Hardly seems long enough...
for Carl Will to grow to hate him
enough to wanna kill him.
Strange things happen in stir.
Like the other inmates
who have died in here?
<i>Seven in the last five years.</i>
<i>All accidents?</i>
<i>It's a lot more</i>
<i>than the national average.</i>
I wouldn't know anything
about that.
Oh, come on, Henry, you're on
a first name basis with the roaches around here.
What happened
with Anthony Lewis...
and the other dead inmates?
Prison's a place to keep your head down
and your mouth shut.
Especially this place.
And this warden.
<i>[Whistle Blows]</i>
<i>Let's move it in.</i>
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>I have two minutes left to live.</i>
My mouth is dry.
<i>I'm calm, but I'm scared.</i>
I feel my heart
pounding in my ears.
<i>[Young Sydney]</i>
<i>It's time to tell the truth.</i>
- I did.
- This is your last chance.
I did tell the truth.
You're about to die.
Clear your conscience.
It is clear.
I'm at peace.
Rosenberg was telling the truth, Sydney.
He didn't give the secrets away.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Aren't you?
<i>[Young Sydney]</i>
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>But if they knew he was innocent...</i>
why did they execute him?
<i>[Young Sydney]</i>
<i>What do you think?</i>
Because someone
had to be guilty.
[Cell Door Clattering]
Tighten it.
I don't want the prisoner to go
into spasm and break those straps.
Initiate the sequence.
[Breathing Heavily]
Larson, drop the pellets.
[Beeps]
- Why the hesitation?
- Mistake in communications, sir.
It won't happen at showtime.
<i>[Warden]</i>
<i>Yeah, well, see that it doesn't.</i>
'Cause we're gonna have a roomful
of press back there for the real execution...
and I don't wanna
have to kill Carl Will twice.
- Get him out of there.
- <i>[Larson] Yes, sir.</i>
Thanks, Bradley.
Do you know what's wrong
with me or not?
I think you have an ulcer.
And from the way you were folded up
when I got here, it's a doozy.
- What can be done?
- <i>For now, I'm going to prescribe...</i>
<i>a mild acid inhibitor.</i>
I'm not sure
that it will be helpful...
given the fact that she smokes...
<i>and has an unusually</i>
<i>stressful demeanor.</i>
You can say that again.
<i>I don't know what it is</i>
<i>you do, Miss Parker...</i>
but it's eating you away
from the inside out.
<i>You're going to have</i>
<i>to change your lifestyle...</i>
- <i>or else.</i>
- Or else what?
You could die.
<i>I suggest that you learn</i>
<i>to control your emotions.</i>
Like your father here.
Have a pleasant evening.
- <i>[Sydney] Thank you, Doctor.</i>
- <i>[Broots] Thanks, Doc.</i>
He's right, you know.
If you don't keep those feelings
aboutJarod in check...
it could be your ruin.
It's a little late
to be worried about my ruin.
[Clamoring]
<i>My flowers.!</i>
Break it up!
- No, boss!
- <i>[Warden] Clancy.!</i>
Clean up this mess.
Get 'em back
in their cages now.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>All right, clear the yard.! Move it.!</i>
You ever make a move like that
on me again, I'll put you <i>in</i> this plot.
I just didn't want
my flowers trampled.
Well, that won't be
a problem now, will it?
- You okay?
- Sure. Fine.
You're sure?
<i>I don't understand.</i>
<i>If these letters aren't real, wh</i>...
<i>I don't understand.</i>
<i>If these letters aren't real, wh</i>...
Where's my wife?
She died three years ago.
Cancer.
- I'm sorry.
- Pretty pathetic, huh?
No.
You lock a man away
long enough...
it bends him...
sometimes till he breaks.
Rita and me
were married 43 years.
You didn't know that, did you?
No, I didn't.
I broke the law, and I've paid every day
for the last 27 years.
But there's certain things
that a man...
can't allow
to be taken from him.
His pride, his dignity.
I understand rules.
But what Warden Michaels
did to me was wrong.
All I wanted
was to be there when...
my Rita was laid down.
I put her through a lot of pain.
And I just wanted to be able
to put flowers on her grave...
and feel her in my heart...
one more time.
He wouldn't give me a furlough.
Hell, they...
they let cons out
for that kind of thing every day.
All I wanted to do
was say good-bye.
Is that why you planted
your garden?
Crazy, huh?
I keep praying maybe...
one day I'll actually get the chance
to show how much I loved her.
But Michaels,
he's set on making...
a statement with this place.
<i>I guess maybe</i>
<i>they were my statement.</i>
I just didn't want them
to think they broke me.
[Slinky Clanging]
- Hey, buddy.
- <i>[Boy] Hey, wait up.!</i>
I hope you don't mind.
I brought your kids some toys.
Hi, cutie.
Give this to your mother.
Tell her I'll be there
in a second, okay?
You have
a beautiful family.
- <i>You're a lucky man.</i>
- Thanks.
Something on your mind?
Carl Will.
- What about him?
- Well, I'm a little bit embarrassed to admit this...
but I'm not sure
I can handle this execution.
I know it's what we do,
but I've never seen a man die before.
I was hoping you could help me.
- Well, you're talking to the wrong man.
- Yeah.
I saw your face as we were
doing the walk-through.
It's pretty difficult for you
to imagine Carl Will strapped to that chair...
gas rising up,
choking the life out of him.
Why is that?
It just is, okay?
Hmm.
Did you ever notice
that these things are just like guilt?
You can move it
from one place to another...
but it always comes back.
Who are you?
Someone who doesn't want
to see an innocent man die.
<i>Someone who thinks thatJessica Will</i>
<i>deserves to have her father...</i>
just as much as those kids
deserve to have theirs.
I've been walking
the yard for 20 years.
It's all I know.
It's too late
to start over, and...
I can't afford to cross
a guy like Clancy.
- You're afraid for your life.
- Yeah, well, you should be too.
You know how it is on the inside.
Things happen.
And I'm damn sure not gonna end up
like Anthony Lewis and the others.
Lewis was transferred in
from Joliet.
Just like all the other men
who died here.
I pulled the inmates' files
and I tracked them.
It's really interesting.
Each one of them belonged to
the same Chicago crime family.
My guess would be that somebody
paid to have them silenced.
Is that the way
the operation worked?
Yeah. Clancy's
brother-in-law...
is a pencil pusher atJoliet.
He made a deal
with a rival family.
They transferred targets
into Oakfield.
Clancy does the job.
They split the money.
Are you a part of it?
No, I wasn't.
I didn't find out until
after Anthony Lewis was killed.
And by then,
I was in too deep to say anything.
What about Carl Will?
Clancy was finishing up
on Lewis, and Will walked in.
I was supposed to make sure
the area was clear.
Hell, I thought he was just hitting
the guy up for cash.
- Is that when you knocked him out?
- Yeah, well, I had to.
Clancy would have killed
the guy right there.
Clancy planted
the shiv on him.
By the time Will came to...
it was over.
And now he's going to die...
for something he didn't do.
<i>[Broots] There's definitely</i>
<i>something wrong with this game.</i>
Maybe not all the pieces are there.
They're not, they're not,
but it's more than that.
<i>I have a feeling we're not seeing something</i>
<i>important with this whole thing.</i>
[Pills Rattle]
Speak for yourself.
Got us a Stetson.
- <i>[Gun Cocks]</i>
- Well, I hear that.
Twitch and your next stop
is Boot Hill.
Hey, relax, little lady.
I'm just the pony express.
Put the phone down
and turn around... slowly.
That's an awfully big gun
for such a pretty little lady.
Save it for the hoedown.
What are you doing here?
Well, I told you.
I was paid to make a delivery.
Yes. What kind of delivery?
Hey, I'm unarmed. I swear.
Left hand only.
I knew there was
something missing.
What are you talking about?
<i>The game. Chance.</i>
<i>Get out ofjail free.</i>
<i>[Sydney] What do you think</i>
<i>it means, Miss Parker?</i>
Damn it.
I need to see
your registration book.
<i>[Clerk]</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
[Muttering]
<i>[Pages Turning]</i>
"Jarod Short. Jarod St. James.
Jarod Ventnor.
Jarod Chance. Marvin Gardens.
Room 5." The room...
The room right next to ours.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>"Go directly tojail. Do not pass Go.</i>
<i>Do not collect $200. '"</i>
I am sick of being a token
on his game board.
Miss Parker.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Go directly tojail.</i>
Damn you, Jarod.
[Chanting]
Free Carl Will. Free Carl Will.
Hey, Clancy.
The warden just called.
He wants you to make another check
of the gas chamber.
- Make sure there's no malfunctions.
- It's fine.
I loaded the cyanide myself
not an hour ago.
Hey, don't shoot the messenger.
Guess there's some kind
of electrical problem.
Have Larson check it.
<i>His wifejust called.</i>
<i>He's sick.</i>
My butt. He's yellow.
You check it.
I can't. I'm the new guy.
<i>I have to bring Will his last supper.</i>
All right, damn it.
You need something
done right...
Do it yourself.
Well, good thing
we're not frying this guy.
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
- Warden Michaels?
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
<i>[Clancy] Hey, what's going on here?</i>
<i>Who shut the door?</i>
Who's there?
Scary, isn't it?
Being locked up
like a wild animal...
waiting to die.
Funny, Bradley.
Now let me out.
Mm.
I don't think I'll do that.
What the hell
do you think you're doing?
Same thing you've been doing.
[Clancy On Intercom]
I don't know what you're talking about.
[Jarod On Intercom]
Oh, come on, Clancy.
I know you killed Anthony Lewis.
You set up Carl Will
to take the fall for it.
You were going to let
an innocent man die...
<i>for something you did.</i>
<i>[Clucking Tongue]</i>
Who the hell are you?
I'm you... judge...
- <i>jury</i>...
- <i>[Switch Clicks]</i>
- and executioner.
- <i>[Switch Clicks]</i>
How many men?
<i>How many men</i>
<i>did you kill, Clancy?</i>
Five? Six?
They were animals.
<i>I did the public a favor.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>And you almost got away with it.</i>
<i>Except Carl Will was</i>
<i>at the wrong place at the wrong time.</i>
<i>[Clancy]</i>
<i>Name your price.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>My price?</i>
<i>Money.</i>
<i>How much is a human life</i>
<i>worth anyway?</i>
<i>How much did you make?</i>
<i>5,000?</i>
<i>10,000 a head?</i>
Nah, I think it's time
for justice to win this one.
<i>I'd ask if you had</i>
<i>a last request...</i>
but the truth is...
you don't really deserve it.
It's showtime.
[Beeps]
- No!
- [Sizzles]
<i>[Clancy Yelling, Indistinct]</i>
Don't you think
not telling that man...
those cyanide capsules were fake
is cruel and unusual punishment?
- <i>[Clancy] Bradley.! Aah.!</i>
- Nah.
<i>[Clancy Screaming]</i>
I, uh, would be happy
to answer any questions you have...
but right now,
I'd like to hug my dad...
and tell him
how much I love him.
[Miss Parker]
Get out of my way.
[Reporters Clamoring]
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Hey, you, open up. We're expected.</i>
<i>[Buzzer Buzzes]</i>
No civilized person could sit here
in front of you people...
and tell you that
he enjoys giving the order...
<i>to have cyanide pellets...</i>
<i>dropped into acid</i>
<i>to kill someone.</i>
<i>But we do that to deter people</i>
<i>from committing crimes.</i>
<i>Unfortunately, there are events that would</i>
<i>prove we have corruption on our staff.</i>
And inspired by these events,
changes will be made here...
that hopefully benefit
all the inmates.
My resignation
will become final in 24 hours...
after my last official act
as warden.
<i>[Man] So, we understand</i>
<i>you like to play games, Mr.</i>...
Parker. Yes.
And I've invented one.
I call it
Get Out ofJail Free.
[Mews]
[Beeping]
What are we doing, Sydney?
An experiment
about sexuality.
- Reproduction?
- That's one aspect of it.
I read the biology manuals.
Reading isn't quite
the same as feeling.
I'd like you to meet
someone, Jarod.
<i>[Beeping Increases]</i>
- You're a girl.
- <i>[Woman On TV] Will you marry me?</i>
- Never. No! Oh!
- <i>[People Laughing]</i>
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Now will you marry me?</i>
They seem to be able to withstand
an amazing amount of pain.
People find this type
of violence funny?
- Not people, men.
- <i>[Men Laughing]</i>
- <i>[Man On TV] You moron.!</i>
- Why is that?
Nobody knows.
The Stooges have been one of...
the great mysteries
between the sexes.
- <i>[Man On TV] Ow.!</i>
- [Laughing]
- I think I see it.
- <i>[Jarod Laughing]</i>
- <i>[Man On TV] My piano.!</i>
- No, not you too.
I'm sorry, but, really,
it is pretty funny.
[Laughing]
Oh. Oh.
I'm sorry.
I feel like such a...
Stooge?
<i>[Men Laughing]</i>
<i>Hey, mattress brain,</i>
<i>the bill's 12.95.</i>
Oh. Oh.
These guys have caused
enough distractions for one day.
<i>[Men Laughing]</i>
Park Service Rangers from all over
have joined in the search...
<i>for Victor Simpkins,</i>
<i>an ornithology grad student...</i>
who vanished
in our local mountains.
<i>I spoke with Simpkins's mother</i>
<i>moments ago.</i>
<i>When I didn't hear</i>
<i>from Victor, well...</i>
I just thought he was late,
but now it's been five days.
<i>I'm just praying he's okay.</i>
<i>With a storm heading this way, rangers are</i>
<i>anxious to find Simpkins before it's too late.</i>
Live from the Toluca National Forest,
this is David Milkson, <i>Action 15.</i>
- Okay, here's your...
- <i>[Man #2 On TV] Thank you, David.</i>
<i>In other local news</i>...
<i>I need one more body to help sector out</i>
<i>Scovell Ridge, B-1 through B-7.</i>
Steep approach, bad underbrush,
a lot of slippery shale.
- Who wants to hump that?
- I'm your man.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
- You got experience?
- I spent a few years...
<i>in the Army Rangers.</i>
- I specialized in high mountain work.
- Man, you were made to order.
- <i>You could say that.</i>
- What's your name?
Jarod... Forest.
<i>All right, people, listen up.</i>
<i>Advance parties went up at dawn.</i>
We move out in 30 minutes.
<i>This kid's been missing for five days,</i>
<i>and his mother's very concerned.</i>
He... We are running out of time,
so we leave no stones unturned.
We're looking for a needle, folks,
and we haven't even found the haystack.
- <i>Forest. Derek Kobey.</i>
- <i>Nice to meet you.</i>
So, had anyone seen Victor Simpkins
before he was reported missing?
No one was looking for him.
Of course, for the last few days...
the boss had me doing paperwork while he
got to do all the fun stuff.
- Fun stuff?
- <i>Stan's been on the north side...</i>
of the mountain clearing trails,
setting charges.
<i>Lots of deep ravines,</i>
<i>caves, fallen old growth.</i>
<i>You take a tumble in that, I don't care if</i>
<i>you're Moby Dick, we might not find you.</i>
It sounds like you know
the terrain pretty well.
<i>Eight years. I came out here</i>
<i>on one of those...</i>
"Let's expose the urban youth to
the great outdoors" programs.
- <i>[Man] Hey, Derek.</i>
- Funny thing is, it worked.
- <i>Phone.</i>
- I love the Bronx, but this is home now.
So, Forest, where did you do
your mountain training?
- In the mountains, mostly.
- Yeah.
No, seriously, where were
you stationed? Fort Lewis?
- You were in the army too?
- <i>Fifteen years.</i>
<i>You ever come across a Sergeant Tripcheck,</i>
<i>a Ranger instructor at Benning?</i>
- Sounds familiar.
- He's lying, Stan.
He's really one of the Stooges.
- You two know each other?
- We ran into each other once.
- Is she a ranger?
- No. She's a volunteer.
<i>She runs a little outfitting</i>
<i>place a few miles down the road.</i>
I wouldn't get any ideas.
She keeps mostly to herself.
<i>Stan, just got word</i>
<i>from the advance team.</i>
- They found Simpkins's base camp.
- <i>[Radio Chatter]</i>
We'll split into teams of two
and fan across the mountain.
I want everyone to report in
at 30-minute intervals.
- <i>[Man On Radio] Standing by for an update.</i>
- <i>I need flares over here.</i>
Where's Forest?
Disturbance in the Force?
- Uh, the Force?
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?
Star Wars?
- The satellite missile defense system?
- What are you doing?
I'm just trying to imagine
what kind of person Victor is...
<i>and who would want to spend</i>
<i>months in isolation on purpose.</i>
Somebody who's trying
to find himself?
In the middle of the wilderness?
Sometimes you have to get lost
before you can find yourself.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>One more man for the team.</i>
Mrs. Simpkins?
Hi, I'm Jarod Forest.
I was wondering if I might
ask you some questions about your son.
Anything to help.
- Is Victor right-handed or left-handed?
- He's right-handed.
I noticed that he had
many books on predatory birds.
He's been out here for months documenting
the nesting patterns of eagles.
<i>He's loved them since</i>
<i>he was a little boy.</i>
He used to sit out in front of
his tent and watch them all day.
He's the only family I have.
Don't worry.
We'll find him.
- We won't leave the mountain until we do.
- This way, Mrs. Simpkins.
- So who am I paired with, Stan?
- Moe.
- You look confused.
- I am confused.
Victor had been out here
for months...
yet there was no sign of
a refuse pile or a latrine?
- Meaning?
- I don't know.
- Just another piece of the puzzle.
- You're a strange Stooge, Moe.
What about that left-hand,
right-hand stuff?
<i>Victor's eyeglasses were on</i>
<i>the left-hand side ofhis sleeping bag.</i>
Seems kind of awkward
for a right-handed man.
This way. Jarod?
Somebody's covered their tracks
by brushing over them.
<i>They head up that way.</i>
Aah! Aah!
- I didn't mean to startle you.
- That's okay. I'll live.
About two weeks less,
but I'll live.
Hi.
I'm Jarod, and this is Nia.
<i>Bob. Sorry, Jarod.</i>
<i>You startled me.</i>
Can't shake the hand
of a man who just startled me.
I have to wait till
the next time I see you.
- Are you hiding from someone, Bob?
- Hiding? I'm looking.
Oh. Oh, you're with
the search party.
Search party? They got
a search party to find Bob?
- <i>I thought you were Bob.</i>
- I am Bob, Big Bob.
Looking for Little Bob.
He's my partner.
Oh, uh...
- <i>We're looking for a student.</i>
- His camp was about three miles west.
- <i>Brown hair, about 5'11".</i>
- Don't know him.
Don't know his camp.
I ain't seen nothing.
<i>Should we alert someone</i>
<i>about Little Bob?</i>
No, you don't want
to get my partner mad.
I've seen him go into a bar
and tear it up from one end to the other.
- How will we know him if we find him?
- <i>You don't want to find him.</i>
He don't like strangers.
Truth be told, he don't like anybody.
[Sniffing]
Bad storm coming.
Bad one.
- [Chuckles]
- <i>[Thunder Rumbling]</i>
<i>And before the Rangers?</i>
Test pilot, thoracic surgeon,
lieutenant commander on a destroyer.
The usual. What did you do
before you became an outfitter?
Astronaut, Olympic skater,
Nobel Prize winner.
The usual.
[Nia]
What's that over there?
<i>It's a carabineer.</i>
<i>I'm going to get it.</i>
No climber would
leave that behind.
Be careful. You don't know these cliffs.
It's dangerous.
Relax. I was a Sherpa
on Mount Everest once.
Really.
Be careful.
These markings are fresh.
Looks like it's only
a few days old.
Jarod!
[Shouts]
Come on.
Ow!
<i>That's Victor's mark.</i>
<i>Orange tape.</i>
The Inuit sign for eagle.
He said anybody
could use their initials.
He's an experienced climber.
He wouldn't leave his equipment
behind unless...
Listen, the sun rises at 6:35.
We deploy here from K-4 to K-8,
just below the cliff.
I want everyone here
at quarter of 6:00.
There's a cold front moving
through in the next 48 hours.
Will my son
be able to survive?
Your son is
an experienced climber.
<i>He may be cold and he may be hungry,</i>
<i>but people have survived worse.</i>
I know he's out there somewhere,
worrying about you too.
Everybody, get some sleep.
We head out at
the crack of dawn.
- Hey, Kobey, where's the nearest motel?
- About 100 miles.
And when you get there,
you'll wish it was another 100.
<i>I've got a spare room.</i>
<i>Grab your gear.</i>
<i>I'll wait for you outside.</i>
Man, that must've been
some search up there today.
Hmm?
Senorita Iceberg invites you
over for a slumber party?
- You are in.
- In where?
Couch is old, and except for
a spring or two in your back...
it's comfortable.
I'm sure it will be fine.
The <i>Casa Rosada.</i>
You're Argentinean.
<i>Is this you</i>
<i>with your parents?</i>
Not too many gringos know about
the Argentinean White House.
I'm impressed.
- <i>Is that everything?</i>
- I travel light.
- On the run?
- Some days.
I do a lot of consulting work.
Take off your shirt.
Why didn't you say
it was so bad?
I guess I didn't realize it.
I'll try to leave some
hot water for you.
<i>Okay?</i>
[Beeping]
You're a girl.
My name is Jarod.
What's your name?
Miss Parker.
Shower's all yours.
Sleep well.
You too.
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- <i>This is Sydney.</i>
- [Jarod] It's me.
I need to talk to you...
about women.
- Why is that?
- Because I met one.
<i>[Nia] No.!</i>
<i>[Shouting In Spanish]</i>
[Spanish]
<i>[Shouting Continues]</i>
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>
<i>It's all right.</i>
It's okay. It's okay.
You're safe.
[Jarod]
It's me.
I need to talk to you...
about women.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Why is that?</i>
- <i>Because I met one.</i>
- <i>Tell me more.</i>
<i>I've been around hundreds</i>
<i>of women since I left...</i>
<i>but I never experienced with them</i>
<i>what I feel with the one I'vejust met.</i>
- <i>Tell me about your feelings.</i>
- <i>I have a hard time focusing when I'm near her.</i>
<i>And if we happen to touch,</i>
<i>my heart rate...</i>
<i>my blood pressure,</i>
<i>even my breathing becomes erratic.</i>
Frankenboy has a girlfriend.
- <i>[Sydney] It's chemical, Jarod.</i>
- <i>Chemical?</i>
<i>The feelings you're having</i>...
<i>they're driven by your body's response</i>
<i>to an external stimulus.</i>
- <i>In this case, a woman.</i>
- <i>Tonight, when she came out of the shower</i>...
- <i>[Broots] There.</i>
- What are you doing?
That's where the radio
in the background is clearest.
A little presto-chango, and maybe we
can filter it out and figure out the song.
I didn't hear any radio.
I would like to hear
the rest of the tape.
Maybe there's a clue
you might have missed.
[Clears Throat]
<i>[Stan]</i>
<i>Now if Victor Simpkins went down here...</i>
<i>he had to go through an area</i>
<i>between this cliff face and the river.</i>
Anybody find anything,
we're on channel nine.
All right.
Let's move out, quickly.
We found Simpkins's
carabineer here, right?
Yes. Why?
The Force still with you?
Why cross a cliff that dangerous
when you can hike around it?
Maybe he just got the urge.
People don't always plan things.
No, I guess they don't.
Thanks for
being there last night.
What did you mean when you said,
"I don't want to disappear"?
- I said that?
- <i>Twice.</i>
- In Spanish.
- You must've misunderstood me.
<i>Hablo espanol muy bien.</i>
<i>[Clears Throat]</i>
<i>I said, "Here's the tape copy you wanted. '"</i>
OfJarod's conversation.
Are you still here?
Uh, no.
<i>[Young Miss Parker]</i>
<i>You're afraid of me, aren't you?</i>
- No.
- You were yesterday.
- I could tell.
- I was nervous.
- You have soft skin.
- You didn't even touch me.
Yes, I did. In here.
Hold out your hand
like this.
Can you feel it?
What's your name?
Your first name?
[No Audible Dialogue]
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>So let me get this straight.</i>
<i>They were called "The Three Stooges, '"</i>
<i>but there were actually four.</i>
With Shemp.
Five if you countJoe Besser.
Though a lot
of people don't.
And six if you include
Curly-Joe DeRita.
But he wasn't even funny in Spanish.
[Laughs]
[Jarod Laughs]
- Was Larry one of the brothers?
- No.
- Moe, Curly and...
- <i>[Twig Snaps]</i>
- What?
- I thought I heard something.
<i>[Shouting]</i>
- Are you okay?
- [Groaning]
Sorry. I can't
shake your hand just yet.
This is the second time
you've seen me.
Except you just walked between two
pine trees. Ain't never gonna happen.
- Did you find your partner?
- No.
I gotta keep checking on my crop,
even without him.
- Checking on your crop?
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Now I gotta do Little Bob's job too.
- Is he sick?
Nerves. Had the shakes ever since
that plane buzzed him last Friday.
<i>And then the dynamite.</i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>
That just about
put him over the top.
Someone was setting off
dynamite out here?
Yeah, Ranger Conrad was clearing
the trail of some old stumps.
- <i>[Man] Sector 4, come in.</i>
- Forest here.
I found Victor Simpkins's pack
about a quarter of a mile downstream...
from the cliff, lodged in some debris
along the riverbank.
Simpkins's tracks
led right to the water.
<i>I'm guessing he got hurt</i>
<i>in the fall from the cliff...</i>
<i>made it to the water,</i>
<i>passed out or slipped and fell in.</i>
If he didn't drown,
he's somewhere downriver...
- or in the Pacific.
- <i>[Mrs. Simpkins] Oh, my God.!</i>
- Are you calling off the search for my son?
- No, ma'am.
I'm shifting personnel and oversight to
the Anawalt County Sheriff's Department...
who's got direct supervision
of the river from here to the coast.
Now, listen,
I called Sheriff Hansen.
He's a good man. He'll do
whatever he can to help find Victor.
Come with me, Mrs. Simpkins.
He's got enough gear and food
to climb for days.
He was documenting
the nesting patterns of eagles.
There's nothing here
to write on.
It doesn't make sense.
His camp, his carabineer,
this... this backpack.
<i>[Nia]</i>
<i>But what does it mean?</i>
Someone wants the search
for Victor to go downstream.
You're not going,
are you?
No.
He's still on this mountain.
Can anybody hear me?
[Coughing]
<i>[Shower Running]</i>
[Young Sydney]
Jarod, <i>Apollo 1</i> simulation.
The first warning is a flash as the spark
ignites the pure oxygen in the capsule.
I try to flee, but I can't.
I'm strapped in.
I know the escape procedure,
but the fire, it's too hot.
It comes into my air lines.
I try not to breathe, but it's too late.
I can't open the hatch.
I can't open the hatch!
It's too hot!
I can't think!
No one can get to us!
We can't be saved!
I'm burning! I'm burning!
Jarod! I'm here. It's all right.
No one could save them.
It was impossible.
<i>I tried not to use</i>
<i>all the hot water.</i>
<i>[Closes Briefcase]</i>
Is that boy you?
- I know it's crazy, but I can explain.
- Shh.
We all have scars.
- <i>[Sydney] How much longer, Broots?</i>
- <i>Hard to say.</i>
At first, I thought the song
from Jarod's phone call...
was "I Shot the Sheriff,"
but then I refiltered it...
- and realized it was "Bungle in theJungle."
- Mm-hmm.
How much longer, Broots?
Well, between BMI's and ASCAP's
computer base of playlists...
it could be some time.
But then as soon as we get a hit,
and we find the station...
I've programmed the computer
to call here.
Then... [Clears Throat]
we're in business.
- We're in business.
- Yeah.
How much longer?
Wake up.
I think I've got it.
<i>We've been climbing</i>
<i>for nine hours.</i>
- You want to tell me what we're looking for?
- That.
This was Victor's camp.
The Force <i>is</i> with you.
How did you know?
Something always bothered me
about Simpkins's base camp.
<i>The camp was way too low</i>
<i>on the mountain to observe...</i>
<i>the nesting patterns of eagles, because</i>
<i>they always nest at the highest point.</i>
- <i>What the hell is that?</i>
- The plane that scared Little Bob.
The pilot's dead.
There was a bullet in his head.
- Oh, my God.
- I found traces of narcotics in the back.
- And I found this.
- Deliver your drugs, pick up your money.
You don't file a flight plan with a run
like this, so if your plane crashes...
- No one looks for you.
- Somebody was up here.
There's two sets of footprints, but they
both come from different directions.
Then one chases the other... that way.
<i>He heard the crash,</i>
<i>came down here.</i>
He just wanted to help.
<i>He saw the murder.</i>
He's running.
He's running for his life.
<i>Victor Simpkins.</i>
And who was chasing him?
Who was blowing up stumps
when Bob heard the plane?
- Conrad.
- Conrad is leading the search.
- What were you... How did you...
- Trust in the Force, young Jedi.
I saw your laser disk
last night.
Those prints head down
to Box Canyon.
We'll start that way tomorrow.
I hope Victor Simpkins is under
some kind of cover tonight.
Because if he's not,
he's not going to make it.
Neither are we,
unless we find some shelter.
<i>I know a place.</i>
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?
- Shut up!
- Let him alone.
- [Moe] You too. Come here.
- [Larry, Shemp Groaning]
- [Larry, Shemp] Mmmm.
- There.
- [Larry, Shemp Groaning]
- Morons.
[Jarod]
I need to talk to you... about women.
[Rewinding]
- About women.
- [Rewinding]
About women.
<i>You know, girls mature</i>
<i>faster than boys.</i>
<i>[Thunderclap]</i>
<i>[Thunderclap]</i>
Nothing like
a home-cooked meal.
So I'm told.
When I was a child...
I was taken...
<i>at least I think I was taken</i>...
by these people who raised me.
<i>They made me do things</i>...
things that hurt other...
- You don't have to tell me anything.
- <i>I know.</i>
I never told anybody before,
but I want to tell you.
I don't know who I am.
You'reJarod,
and you're here with me.
[Chuckles]
- How old were you when you left Argentina?
- Thirteen.
Was it because of
the <i>Guerra Sucia?</i>
I saw the scars on your back.
I was eight.
They came and took us
for no reason at all.
My father
published a newspaper.
My mother met him
when she was a reporter.
But she hadn't worked
for years.
She was too busy raising me.
They woke us up
in the middle of the night.
<i>I could hear my mother screaming,</i>
<i>cursing at them.</i>
I never heard her
swear like that before.
<i>They took us to this place</i>...
<i>this horrible place.</i>
I never saw them again.
They beat me.
They... They...
[Whispering]
I'm sorry.
They wanted me to lie
about my parents...
that they hated the generals,
had plotted against them.
<i>I wouldn't lie.</i>
Finally, they let me go.
They put me with some family...
but no one will talk to me
about my parents.
They had disappeared.
<i>Then the generals left,</i>
<i>and I came here.</i>
I don't know if my parents
are dead or alive.
I don't know either.
I miss them very much.
- [Sobbing]
- I know, I know.
I know, I know, I know.
Shh. Shh. Shh.
Shh. Shh.
I know this is going
to sound crazy.
- I've never...
- Shh.
I just want to know who I am.
I can stand anything for that.

<i>Is that pig wearing a baseball cap?</i>
There you are.
Look at him.
All the stress
made him lose weight.
<i>Sooey, sooey, sooey, sooey.!</i>
<i>Come here you, boy.</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Is that your pig?</i>
- Pig? He's no pig.
He's my partner in
a burgeoning mushroom empire.
- Little Bob.
- Little Bob.
- The one and only.
- And your crop would be truffles?
The finest damn nose
in these United States.
Found a mother lode too.
We could've been rich,
till someone went and blowed up...
the old mine shaft where he
discovered over a ton of them.
- Mine shaft?
- Yeah, the one down in Box Canyon.
Blowed it the same day
that plane flew over.
<i>Come here, big boy.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>
Footprints. Two sets.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Two go in, but only one comes out.</i>
Conrad chased Victor,
trying to silence him.
Victor ran in here to hide.
Conrad, running short of time, decided
to blow out the entrance, sealing him in.
The Force is with me.
[Chuckles]
Victor! Victor!
- <i>[Nia] Victor.!</i>
- Victor!
- Victor!
- Victor!
- [Gasping]
- Victor.
- <i>[Nia] Victor.</i>

Toluca National Forest,
Ranger Conrad speaking.
<i>[Big Bob]</i>
<i>Uh, yeah, this is Bob Carsey.</i>
<i>Ranger Conrad, I think I found</i>
<i>the Simpkins kid.</i>
<i>Where is he? Is he alive?</i>
I couldn't tell.
He was trapped behind a rockfall...
inside the old copper mine
in Box Canyon.
I could barely make a hole
big enough to look in and see.
I'm on my way.
Kobey, I need you here to coordinate
the men and the equipment coming up.
- Do you want me to call his mother?
- No.
Not till we're sure
we have good news.
<i>[Clanking]</i>
<i>Hey, Simpkins.</i>
Simpkins. Hey, Simpkins.
<i>Well, it's about time.</i>
<i>My legs were starting to cramp up.</i>
<i>Kind oflike Lazarus,</i>
<i>huh, Conrad?</i>
So, uh, is Simpkins okay?
You mean is he alive,
so he can testify against you?
- You betcha.
- So, why didn't you just call the police?
<i>You're after</i>
<i>what's in the plane.</i>
- Hey, there's a lot more where that came from.
- No deal.
<i>[Booming]</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Kind of spooky in here, isn't it?</i>
<i>Do you think this is what</i>
<i>hell is like, Stan?</i>
Imagine what it's like
to be trapped in here...
<i>and no one</i>
<i>can hear you screaming.</i>
There's only one way out!
<i>Hey, Conrad,</i>
<i>I'd stand back if I were you.</i>
No!
Jarod!
Don't leave me here,
Jarod! Please!
Oh, don't worry.
I'll lead the search for
you personally... in a few days.
Jarod! Jarod!
I know how to do many things...
but I don't know how to do this.
I know you have to go.
People are looking for me.
<i>If I stay,</i>
<i>you'd be in danger.</i>
You may already be.
I know how to
take care of myself.
I hope you find
what you're looking for.
You've already helped me
find a part of it.
<i>Adiós, mi vida.</i>
[Theme From <i>The Three Stooges]</i>
<i>[Car Doors Opening, Closing]</i>
- Have you seen this man?
- Yes.
He was tall, handsome,
a little mole on his right eye.
- Yes?
- He stayed for a few nights.
- He's gone now.
- Did he say where he was going?
<i>No, but he did mention something</i>
<i>about loving Argentina.</i>
Do you think he'll come back?
I hope so.
<i>[Car Engine Starts]</i>
[Mews]
- <i>Previously on</i> The Pretender.
- I know the truth.
And what truth is that, Jarod?
The truth...
about what makes you sad.
- Your mother was a special person.
- My mother was weak. Period.
The only thing that ever bothered me was:
Why in an elevator?
<i>Your mother</i>
<i>was a very special woman.</i>
<i>There was a part ofher</i>
<i>I knew better than anyone.</i>
<i>There was a part ofher</i>
<i>she kept hidden, separate.</i>
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Is that all you do, Jarod? Dig up the past?</i>
That's easy for you to say.
You have one.
[Screaming]
Mama! Mama!
- They're trying to hurt her!
- Stay here, Jarod.
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>
- Mama, no!
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>
- <i>No.!</i>
Mama!
<i>[Gunshot]</i>
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>
- What?
- [Sydney] We've got a hit.
Jarod's the finest sewer rat
I've had the pleasure to work with.
I've never seen someone
so excited about excrement in my life.
A real fecal aficionado.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>How charming.</i>
- <i>[Sydney] How long was Jarod here?</i>
- Couple of weeks.
- That's all it took him to figure it out.
- <i>[Miss Parker] Figure what out?</i>
That we were digging
into an aquifer.
If we had hit that thing,
it would've flushed 45 members...
of the International Brotherhood
of Sewage Workers...
right into
the jaws of oblivion.
Just like that Egyptian army
in <i>The Ten Commandments.</i> Whoosh!
Great.
Now Jarod is Moses.
Moses?
- Charlton Heston.
- [Chuckles] Right.
Thanks.
Mr. McElroy, <i>this</i> is where
Jarod always emerged?
Right in this spot.
<i>Something special about it,</i>
<i>but he wouldn't tell me.</i>
<i>Said he had to ship out.</i>
<i>Commander Forrester,</i>
<i>we have a situation here.</i>
- Report.
- Bogey, sir.
Victor-class submarine,
bearing one four eight.
<i>[Jarod] And closing.</i>
This could be the rogue
we're looking for.
Relax, sailor.
This is the fun part.
Why does the fun part
have to happen on <i>my</i> watch?
- Alert the X.O. and the captain.
- Aye, aye, sir.
We've got a fight
on our hands.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
- <i>[Man] Attention on deck.</i>
- <i>[Man #2] As you were.</i>
<i>Captain Nagel.</i>
<i>Commander Nashton.</i>
It's the <i>Rostov,</i> sir.
After she deployed
from Odessa...
<i>the Uzbeki captain declared independence</i>
<i>from the Black Sea Fleet.</i>
- <i>He's rogue.</i>
- With a hip pocket full of nuclear warheads.
And judging from the intel file,
her first strike target... is Los Angeles.
[Beeping]
- Something's up, sirs.
- They've opened the V.L.S. doors.
Those S.L.B.M.'s will be ready to fire
in approximately two minutes.
<i>Torpedoes in the water,</i>
<i>bearing one three seven and one four two.</i>
- Ready torpedo decoy.
- Ready decoy.
Ready decoy. Aye.
Something's wrong with
this relay, sir.
- What's the problem, Baker?
- Aaah!
We've lost the decoy signal.
- Gentlemen, we got a torpedo on our ass.
- Torpedoes closing, 300 yards.
- The decoy signal's still dead, sir.
- 200 yards.
Ninety seconds
to S.L.B.M. launch.
<i>Come on, Baker.</i>
- Got it. Decoy's on line, sir.
- <i>[Beeping]</i>
Torpedo number one just took the bait.
Number two closing.
It's a miss.
<i>Rostov's</i> V.L.S. system
is still ready.
Those nukes fly
in one minute, sir.
- Forty degrees starboard.
- <i>[Man] Forty degrees starboard.</i>
- Steady on course... zero nine zero.
- <i>[Man] Zero nine zero.</i>
Sir, suggest we fire both torpedoes now
while he's still in range.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Sir.</i>
I recommend
that we fire one now...
that we veer approximately 30 degrees starboard
and then fire torpedo two.
- Veer? Why don't we just...
- Fire torpedo one.
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Fire one. Aye. Torpedo away.</i>
Thirty seconds
until warhead launch.
- Veer thirty degrees starboard.
- <i>[Jarod] Right full rudder.</i>
Steady course
one two zero.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Right full rudder, one two zero. Aye.</i>
One is a miss, sir.
- Fire two.
- Fire two. Aye.
- <i>Torpedo away.</i>
- Twenty seconds until warhead launch.
Those birds are hot.
Ten seconds until
warhead launch.
Number two is a direct hit.
She's going down.
<i>[Cheering, Clapping]</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>This is Captain Drucker of the</i> Harrison.
<i>[Mimics Russian Accent] You've blown us</i>
<i>out of water, you crazy Yankee pig.</i>
Acknowledged. Always a pleasure
to run a simulation with you, Ted.
<i>Never a cold war when you need one.</i>
Harrison <i>out.</i>
<i>You got nothing to smile about.</i>
<i>Another three seconds...</i>
and L.A.'s a parking lot.
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Way to go, Baker.</i>
<i>Lieutenant Commander</i>
<i>Forrester...</i>
<i>this crew is loose.</i>
It's too loose.
The <i>Monroe</i> is a team,
like links in a chain.
If one of those links
breaks under stress...
<i>we slip that much closer</i>
<i>to disaster.</i>
[Loudly]
In one week, we hit the big blue.
It is imperative that
your response times improve.
After what happened
on our last tour...
<i>I want this ship running</i>
<i>like a damn Swiss watch.</i>
All right.
You just traded your day off
for a ride on my personal highway to hell.
<i>[Nashton]</i>
<i>Left, left, left.!</i>
<i>Come on, people.!</i>
<i>It's a highway to hell. We love it.!</i>
<i>Come on.!</i>
- <i>Having fun yet?</i>
- [All] Yes, sir!
<i>Come on, people.!</i>
<i>Do you love it?</i>
- Yes, sir!
- <i>I can't hear you.!</i>
Yes, sir!
<i>Let's go. Let's go.</i>
<i>Come on. Let's go. Come on.</i>
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>
<i>Let's go. Move it.</i>
- Move it out. Move it out. Move it out.
- [Yells]
Move it out!
Move! Move! Move!
[Jarod]
Move! Move! Move!
<i>[All Shouting]</i>
I didn't really want a day off.
Did you, Baker?
- What?
- You can't even handle a little circuit flare-up?
I mean, if something
goes wrong this tour...
you're not gonna screw up on us like you did
in the pump room with Seaver?
<i>Seaver was a dumb-ass.</i>
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Hey, get him.! Get him.!</i>
[All Yelling]
[Jarod]
Break it up! Get up! Break it up!
Knox! Marcus!
Baker, you've got
the highest rank here.
If I even catch you
looking at these sailors the wrong way...
I'm gonna have you in the scullery
every day for a week!
- Understood, sailor?
- Yes, sir!
- Fall out!
- <i>[Man] All right. Move out.</i>
<i>[Man #2]</i>
<i>Sir.</i>
Well, you handled
that little situation well.
Just as well as
maneuvers this morning.
Sir, I'm sorry about that.
- I didn't mean to step out of line.
- Oh, yes, you did.
You're just lucky that
you made the right call.
I guess. Nagel seemed pretty steamed
about the last tour.
Yeah, well, that's
the only chink in his armor.
We lost a sailor.
There was a gas leak in the pump room.
- A gas leak?
- Yeah. JX-5.
Whoa. A roomful of that
could've set off the entire ship.
Whoo. Tell me about it.
I had the deck that night.
It's pretty intense. It's not something
I want to live through again.
Hey, tell me something,
will ya?
How did you know that the <i>Harrison</i>
was gonna cut and run?
"Bulldog" Ted Drucker
was at the conn.
- It's his favorite evasive technique.
- Oh, you served with him?
<i>Actually, Jarod's from the</i> Grant, <i>sir.</i>
<i>Lieutenant Paula Pratt.</i>
At ease.
Security officer.
Lieutenant Commander
Jarod Forrester.
Yes. I just ran the required
checks on your file.
Your dates on the <i>Grant</i> don't jibe
with the Bureau of Personnel.
So why don't you call the <i>Grant</i>
and have 'em clear it up?
I will. As soon as she gets back
from a silent escort in Antarctica.
Next month.
Come see me
at P.S.D. tomorrow.
That woman needs a hobby.
She reminds me of someone
I used to know.
Go through the box
from Jarod's last lair.
Call me with solid leads.
[Sydney]
Where will you be, Miss Parker?
- Out.
- [Beeps Off]
<i>Well, there must be something</i>
<i>you can tell me about my mother.</i>
It's been nearly 30 years, but I remember
how much she loved the children here.
I have reason to believe
that she might have rescued some of them.
- Rescued?
- It's a long story.
Did she... Did she bring
any children here?
No. We've always gotten
our children the usual way:
orphans, runaways,
victims of child abuse.
- I'm afraid I wouldn't know where to begin.
- [Sighs]
I might.
I'm sorry.
None of them ring a bell.
That's okay.
You've been...
You've been very helpful.
Who is this Jarod
you're asking about?
An associate.
I thought maybe
he might have visited you.
No.
- <i>[Sighs]</i>
- It's not a dead end, Miss Parker.
Well, the person who gave this to me
is the master of the dead end.
<i>You could match these</i>
<i>with our files...</i>
<i>but you'd have to go down</i>
<i>to the Hall of Records.</i>
<i>All of these kids</i>
<i>are pre-1970.</i>
<i>Our files were destroyed</i>
<i>in a fire that year.</i>
You had a fire in 1970?
<i>Yes.</i>
April.
How did you know?
That's when my mother died.
At ease.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.
- Just want to welcome you to the <i>Monroe.</i>
- At ease.
Uh, Bazooka.
From my personal stash.
For me?
This is interesting.
Bubble gum
named after a weapon.
Hmm.
Well, it's been
around a while.
It's very good.
And it comes with
its own personal story.
[Laughing]
Very clever.
Well, thank you very much. As you were.
[Laughing]
<i>[Girl]</i>
<i>Get away from me.! Leave me alone.!</i>
<i>I said get</i>...
<i>Get away from me.!</i>
Stop it!
[Panting]
- [Yelps]
- Are you going someplace?
Look, there's two men chasing me.
I think they're some kind of perverts.
You've really gotta help me.
- That's them!
- Commander.
Is there some kind of
problem, Sergeant?
Yes, sir. We caught this bug
trying to hot-wire an ensign's jeep.
Oh, that's a great big lie. Besides, I didn't
even know the jeep belonged to the ensign.
<i>It's the third time this week</i>
<i>we've had a run-in with this desperado.</i>
I see. I think I can handle it
from here.
- My name's Jarod.
- Melina Pratt.
Pratt? As in Security Officer Pratt?
As in her daughter.
- You're gonna tell her about this, aren't you?
- What about your father?
He's the navigator
on the <i>Farragut.</i>
- That's on the Indian Ocean, on patrol?
- Yeah.
He's been gone for
about four months now.
Four and a half.
Must be pretty tough
on you...
and your mother,
your father being gone that long.
My mom just works more.
To me, it's no biggie.
So your dad is gone,
and your mom works all day.
From what I understand,
a teenager lives for that kind of freedom.
<i>Is that true?</i>
If you're so interested in teenagers, maybe
you should become a high school counselor.
I already tried that once.
I mean, the hours were great, but...
the food was terrible.
So, are you gonna tell my mom
about this jeep thing or not?
- <i>Melina.</i>
- What?
Next time you go to
so much trouble...
to get into trouble...
hot-wire an admiral's jeep.
<i>[Man On P.A.]</i>
<i>Communications watch officer and D.D. O...</i>
<i>please report</i>
<i>to the quarterdeck.</i>
<i>Comm watch officer and D.D.O.,</i>
<i>report to the quarterdeck.</i>
That's nice work...
for an oxyacetylene weld.
It's old-school, I know, but it holds tighter
than any of that newfangled stuff.
Snipes are always
getting on me.
TIG weld this,
gas tungsten that.
Got no respect for
the old ways, you know.
- I guess not.
- [Chuckles]
Excuse me.
<i>[Nagel]</i>
<i>Problem, Jarod?</i>
As you were.
Petty Officer Mike Baker.
I pulled him out of a fight a couple of days ago.
- <i>I have a good mind to go up there</i>...
- Whoa, whoa.
I know that you're eager
to crack skulls, but, uh...
don't start on Baker.
<i>He lost his best friend</i>
<i>on our last tour.</i>
Scott Seaver.
I told you about it, Jarod.
The, uh, JX-5 leak in the pump room.
- Oh, yes. Right.
- Seaver botched the retrofit.
Which gave the board of inquiry an excuse
to try to mothball the ship again.
<i>Damn leeches came in here.</i>
<i>They went over every piece of paperwork,</i>
<i>every inspection record...</i>
tried to haul her
out of the water.
Finally, it took
seven admirals to decide...
the problem was Seaver's
shoddy work.
I see.
Well, I guess
I'll ease off Baker then.
He does know that he's on this ship
for the next six months.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Where his best friend died.</i>
<i>[Seaver's Voice]</i>
<i>Oh, my God.! Baker, help me.!</i>
<i>[Man] Surprise inspection,</i>
<i>or are you stealing stock tips?</i>
<i>I was just...</i>
getting to know
the territory.
You play the stock market.
Hey, you want to put a kid through college
on my salary, you gotta take some chances.
Actually, my son picks out
all my stocks.
He wants to see his tuition keep coming,
he better pick 'em right.
- Is he a business major?
- He's a tight end.
Got a good brain.
Average hands. No scholarship.
But I'll be damned he's gonna spend
his whole life sweating in a hole like this.
- You sure this ain't no inspection?
- Promise.
Good. I mean,
nothing personal, sir, but, uh...
I've been turning
wrenches down here...
since you and most of this crew
were playing kick the can.
And what can was I kicking?
All I'm saying is, uh,
you don't need to go wasting your time...
checking up on
Lieutenant Albert Danes.
As you were.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
<i>[Man Shouting Commands</i>
<i>In Distance]</i>
[Laughing]
They're very funny.
They still make those?
<i>[Jarod] Yeah. But what I don't understand is</i>
<i>why does he wear the eye patch?</i>
Matters of cosmic importance
I'm not prepared to address.
Huh.
I wanted you here
when I call Admiral Mason.
You remember Admiral Mason.
He signed your recommendation.
How could I forget?
<i>[Autodial Beeps,</i>
<i>Line Ringing]</i>
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Admiral Mason's office.</i>
Lieutenant Paula Pratt calling
from Long Beach Naval Station.
<i>[Woman] I'm sorry. The admiral</i>
<i>is on his annual fishing trip to Bimini.</i>
<i>[Pratt]</i>
<i>It's nice somebody has time for a vacation.</i>
- How long will he be gone?
- <i>[Woman] Two weeks.</i>
<i>And he left strict orders not to be disturbed</i>...
<i>unless, of course, it's urgent.</i>
I'll call back.
- Bummer.
- Bummer?
- <i>Melina, she's busy.!</i>
- That's whatJoe would say.
<i>I don't care how busy she is.</i>
<i>I need to see her.!</i>
<i>Melina, I'm in a meeting.</i>
I know.
Hi.
But I can't even get an appointment,
and I need to know today if I can go see R.E.M.
Rapid eye movements?
- No. It's a band.
- Oh.
- Tickets go on sale in an hour.
- I told you.
<i>I don't want you</i>
<i>going alone.</i>
I won't be alone, Mom.
There'll be 40,000 other people there.
[Sighs]
I am busy. We will talk about this later.
Yeah, what else is new?
My daughter.
- Yo. What's up?
- Why won't you talk to me?
[Chattering]
How'd your tattoo come out?
What are you, stalking me?
Not exactly.
This police officer
stopped by and, uh...
left you
this parking ticket.
Great.
My mom's gonna go ballistic
when she sees this.
Not to mention
when she finds out you stole her car.
But having her go ballistic...
that's the general idea, isn't it?
Come on. You can do it.
Try it again.
Wrap it around
your tongue and...
blow.
- [Laughs]
- Yes!
- I can't believe no one taught
you how to blow bubble gum.
- I had a lonely childhood.
Yeah, join the club.
<i>"I.L. Y. '"</i>
<i>Is that another band?</i>
No. Just three letters
I want to remember. That's all.
What are your parents
going to say?
I don't care.
- My mom hates me, and my dad's never around.
- Your mom does not hate you.
- Parents love their children.
- Oh, what sitcom are you living in?
[Laughs]
- <i>[Bubble Pops]</i>
- <i>[Man On Recording] In conclusion...</i>
victim Seaver expired after inhaling theJX-5
toxic gas from the ship's coolant system.
<i>Ice crystals formed in the lungs</i>
<i>within 30 seconds, resulting in asphyxiation.</i>
Furthermore,
additional trauma...
<i>[Seaver]</i>
<i>Baker.! Baker.! Oh, my God.!</i>
- <i>Can't sleep?</i>
- Sir.
At ease, sailor.
Sit down.
I have nightmares too.
About family
I've never seen...
best friends I've lost.
Scott Seaver did not
botch that retrofit, sir.
And just because some big panel
of admirals says so...
Doesn't mean it's true.
Right.
Scott was edgy...
the whole week
before it happened.
I think he knew there was
something wrong with the <i>Monroe...</i>
but he never would've
let us deploy like that.
Look...
you don't gotta worry about me getting tanked
or getting into fights anymore, sir.
What are you talking about?
I'm gonna talk to
Lieutenant Pratt.
I'm out of here.
You're going to resign.
<i>You think that's going to</i>
<i>solve anything?</i>
I watched him die, sir.
You know, uh,
it hit us out of nowhere.
The pipe burst, and the whole place
was filling up with JX-5.
Scott told me to
get out of there.
He said he could handle it.
I could've saved him.
But then Nashton
sealed the hatch.
Nashton.
<i>I could see Scott...</i>
through the portal.
<i>The gas was</i>
<i>starting to get to him.</i>
Well, first it
makes you crazy.
Fills up your lungs
and freezes 'em.
<i>He couldn't breathe.</i>
Wait.
The X.O. was on deck
that night.
Now, why would Nashton come down here
to seal the hatch?
He said the whole ship
could've blown.
He said he had to
seal the hatch.
Some best friend
I turned out to be, huh?
He didn't have to die, sir.
I should've stayed.
It should've been me
that died.
It wasn't your fault.
<i>[Nashton] There's been a lot of talk</i>
<i>about decommissioning her...</i>
<i>but I'm here to tell you gentlemen</i>
<i>that the U.S.S.</i> Monroe...
<i>is a long way from mothballs.</i>
This accident...
this tragedy...
happened because of substandard work
by a young engineer named Scott Seaver.
<i>[Man] You believe that sealing that room</i>
<i>was the correct course of action.</i>
JX-5 gas might have seeped
to the rest of the ship.
She was a powder keg,
ready to blow.
If I had had the time to pull
him out, I would have done so.
<i>As ranking officers, these are</i>
<i>the kinds of calls that we're expected to make.</i>
It's one of the demons
we have to live with.
I did it to save the ship.
You did it... to save your job.
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
<i>[Footsteps Approaching]</i>
<i>[Door Closes]</i>
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>The door was open.</i>
- <i>Making house calls now, Syd?</i>
- Where were you today?
Last time I checked,
that was a Raines question.
<i>What kind of game</i>
<i>are you playing with Jarod?</i>
Game?
Hall of Records.
<i>You're starting to</i>
<i>ask questions.</i>
The way your mother did.
<i>Her final session with me...</i>
before she got on the elevator...
she was looking for answers.
She didn't have the means
to find them.
- I do.
- Then you'll end up like her.
Is that a threat?
A warning...
from a friend.
Mail call.
These seem to have slipped
through the cracks.
Hey. Personal delivery
from the ops officer.
<i>Thanks.</i>
Letter from my kid at college.
Gonna be an engineer.
Oh, yeah?
Cornell. Must be expensive.
- How'd you know he was going there?
- Interesting.
This is an oxyacetylene weld.
Now, Scott Seaver...
he was only rated for
gas tungsten welding.
<i>If those admirals had known</i>
<i>what to look for...</i>
they would've known
that Seaver didn't botch the retrofit.
Nashton forced you
to do the work...
<i>after it ruptured,</i>
<i>and make it look like Seaver botched it.</i>
- Come on. That's crazy.
- Tell that to Scott Seaver.
<i>I spoke to his best friend.</i>
He said Seaver was nervous
the whole week before the deploy.
He knew something
was wrong, didn't he?
With all due respect, sir.
You've lost it.
Did Nashton threaten your career,
or did he threaten your son's education?
What's the difference?
Nashton said he was gonna turn
the investigating panel on me.
I'd have been
kicked out on my ass.
No pension, no nothing.
<i>And he forced Seaver and me to sign off</i>
<i>on that inspection report...</i>
even though theJX-5 line
needed work.
Brass never knew.
And the extra work
would have delayed deployment.
Or worse,
put the <i>Monroe</i> in mothballs.
No more <i>Monroe...</i>
no more career for Nashton.
So a 20-year-old kid...
chokes to death.
- It could've been your shift.
- Oh, come on.
Nashton tried to save that poor kid. The pump
room was gonna blow. There was no time.
<i>There was plenty of time.</i>
<i>But Seaver knew the truth.</i>
Nashton made sure
he died with it.
<i>[Car Alarm</i>
<i>Blaring In Distance]</i>
<i>[Bottle Rattles]</i>
<i>[Car Alarm Continues Blaring]</i>
<i>[Car Alarm Stops]</i>
Your mom's going to miss you.
Yeah, well, you can't miss something
that's not there to begin with.
I'm not going
back there... ever.
Okay.
You feel like
you're not very important, don't you?
You feel like...
you were forgotten...
- but you haven't been.
- Yeah, what do you know about it?
I don't even know
who my parents are.
I don't know
if they gave me up...
or I was taken from them.
But I know...
they're still out there.
Somewhere.
I know they love me.
- Deep down inside, I know they love me.
- [Sobs]
Just like deep down inside
you know your parents love you.
My mom just buries herself
in work every time my dad's out to sea.
Your mom is responsible
for a lot of people's lives.
Maybe in all that, she overlooks the life
that's most important to her, but I know...
she loves you very much.
I really miss my dad.
"I love you."
I.L.Y.
My dad used to put it on all the satellite
communications he'd send us from the subs.
You know, they only give you, like, 40 words
to say everything you can to each other...
so you gotta abbreviate.
I just wish he was here
to say it in person.
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh.
Sorry, Mama.
I'm sorry too, honey.
- We'll talk inside.
- I'm sorry.
It's okay.
- You have a great kid.
- Yeah.
I think I should tell her that
a little more often.
Thanks.
[Engine Starts]
Are you sure that resigning
is the right thing to do?
Made up my mind, sir.
- Did I say "at ease," sailor?
- No, sir!
Are you sure it's the right thing to do, sailor?
- Yes, sir!
- Is that what Scott Seaver would have wanted?
Hope to see you
on board...
sailor.
At ease.
- [Young Jarod] What's that, Sydney?
- [Young Sydney] I don't know.
[Woman Screaming]
No! No! No.
They're trying to hurt her.
- [Young Sydney] Stay here, Jarod.
- No!
- No.
- [Man] Get her on the elevator!
- <i>[Phone Rings]</i>
- [Gunshot]
- [Man] Get the kid out of here!
- [Young Jarod] Stop!
- What?
- Jarod has them, doesn't he?
<i>Has what?</i>
The answers
you're looking for.
When I catch him,
I'll just have to find out.
You may have that chance.
CommanderJarod Forrester
is currently serving aboard...
the destroyer U.S.S. <i>Monroe.</i>
One of Broots's
routine scans caught it.
However, Naval Intelligence
may already be onto him.
- Naval Intelligence?
- That's correct.
Have my father
call the secretary.
- Yes, Miss Parker.
- Mmm.
<i>[Phone Beeps Off]</i>
<i>[Young Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Mama.!</i>
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>No. Keep her back. Go back.</i>
- <i>[Young Jarod] Leave me alone.!</i>
- <i>[Young Miss Parker] Mama.!</i>
Yes. I'd like to purchase
some tickets, please.
From the secretary.
I'm impressed.
You should be.
Hell of a day
for a deployment.
- What's the good word?
- Surprise.
Your knack for discipline
has inspired me.
I put together one last surprise drill
before we deploy. Here.
<i>Crank it to maximum.</i>
TheJX-5 main?
- That'll overload the system.
- Oh, relax. I've shut off the pressure.
Only the alarm will sound.
Think of it as my personal
highway to hell.
- What's Jarod wanted for?
- You name it, he's done it.
- After you.
- <i>[Whistling]</i>
Pressure's building up.
Hey, where the hell is everybody?
They're in the mess.
Which is sort of
what you're in now.
<i>[Alarm Blaring]</i>
Hey, o-open the hatch!
<i>Forrester.!</i>
<i>Open the hatch.! Now.!</i>
<i>Are you starting to feel</i>
<i>out of it?</i>
Are you starting to feel
disoriented?
- Open the hatch!
- I can't do that.
It could blow
the whole ship up.
You're just
going to have to die...
<i>to save everybody else.</i>
<i>Just like Scott Seaver did.</i>
It's a horrible way to die.
Your lungs,
they fill up with toxic ice...
<i>and then they freeze.</i>
<i>No matter how hard you try...</i>
you won't be able to breathe.
But this is just a judgment call
I'm going to have to make.
Think of it as just another demon
you have to deal with...
when you're an officer.
Huh, Nashton?
Open the hatch!
That's an order, Commander!
That's an order I can't really follow.
You see...
I'm not an officer
on this ship.
Think of me as
Naval Intelligence.
You don't have
anything on me!
<i>[Jarod On Speaker]</i>
<i>I know that you forced Danes...</i>
<i>to tamper with the evidence</i>
<i>after the accident...</i>
to ruin Scott Seaver's name.
<i>You had to preserve</i>
<i>the</i> Monroe <i>to save your career...</i>
<i>so you let</i>
<i>a 20-year-old kid die.!</i>
Didn't you, Nashton?
Didn't you? Didn't you? Didn't you?
Yes. Yes.
God, I'm sorry.
<i>I let him die.</i>
[Gasping]
<i>Now, did you really think that I would</i>
<i>put this ship into danger?</i>
<i>That was just laughing gas.</i>
So try to laugh a little.
[Panting]
Take him straight to
Captain Nagel.
And that's an order.
Yes, sir.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Dismissed.</i>
Sir, you have a man
impersonating an officer on this ship.
I know that.
At ease, Lieutenant. There he is.
- We were talking about Commander Forrester.
- Jarod?
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Jarod is Naval Intelligence.
- I plan to see to it he gets a medal.
- Where is he?
Well, he was ordered back to Norfolk
by the secretary no less.
<i>If you hurry,</i>
<i>you might still catch him.</i>
<i>[Horn Honks]</i>
The nearest ocean
is 1,756 miles from here.
That's just the way I like it.
[Mews]
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Jarod was a real even-tempered man.</i>
Stayed here for about a week,
then he was gone.
I sort of act as
building manager here...
but my real passion
is acupuncture.
<i>Jarod really got into it too.</i>
You stuck needles into him?
<i>Actually, I taught him</i>
<i>how to do it himself.</i>
- For what purpose?
- Stress reduction.
I'm very good at reducing
tensions in the body.
Funny. I'm very good
at causing them.
Jarod wanted the needles placed
along the brachial plexus.
<i>Brachial plexus?</i>
<i>Nerve center for the upper extremities?</i>
<i>[Man] He wanted me to leave them in</i>
<i>until his arm was paralyzed.</i>
<i>He'd walk around</i>
<i>like that for days.</i>
You obviously lived
through the '60s.
Does your companion know
the concept of free love?
- When did he leave?
- Two days ago.
Well, then our work here
is mercifully done.
Oh.
But then you'll
miss out on this.
He said you'd know
what it meant.
This building
isn't far from here.
Hmm.
[Chattering]
- <i>[Woman] He's up there.</i>
- <i>[Sirens Wailing]</i>
Where the hell's
my cameraman?
- It's a long way down.
- Stay away from me.
- Stay away from me.
- I just want to talk to you.
Jarod, what the hell
are you doing up there?
<i>You'd better be</i>
<i>rolling on this guy.</i>
<i>My name's Jarod.</i>
<i>What's your name?</i>
Dave. My name's Dave.
<i>Beautiful family. I'm guessing that's</i>
<i>your wife and your children.</i>
They're gone.
They were evicted,
and now I can't find them.
<i>Dave, I'm sure they're fine.</i>
I'll bet they're out there
somewhere worrying about you.
Nobody's worried about me.
If that were true,
would I be up here on this ledge?
<i>I'm sure that they</i>
<i>are looking for you.</i>
<i>Why should they?</i>
<i>I drink some.</i>
I can't hold a job.
<i>I've lost them for good.</i>
<i>I can help you find them, Dave.</i>
<i>Use the camera.</i>
Tell them how much
you love them...
how much you miss them,
how much you need them.
<i>But first, we have to</i>
<i>get off this ledge.</i>
Grab my hand.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>[Chattering]</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Grab my hand.</i>
<i>Only thing would've made this better</i>
<i>was if thejumper was a topless dancer.</i>
- [Laughs]
- Poor guy.
<i>Annie, edit out some clips</i>
<i>for the promo team A.S.A.P.</i>
This runs tonight. We gotta get some
footage of this loser's wife and kids.
<i>Maybe they've checked into</i>
<i>a homeless shelter.</i>
<i>After all this, don't you think the family</i>
<i>deserves a little privacy?</i>
<i>Privacy? To get her face on the 10:00 news</i>
<i>and some party money in her pocket...</i>
this guy's wife'll jump
at the chance.
- No pun intended, huh?
- [Men Laugh]
Too bad you got such
a good grip there, Jarod.
- Why is that?
- A heroic attempt is as good as a save.
<i>The plunge would've given</i>
<i>this piece a better punch.</i>
Spoken like an anchorman
who wants his anchor back.
You know, Jarod, if my instincts
are as good as I know they are...
your face is going to be running
in every living room in America.
Actually, I think it would play better...
if Phil got credit for the save.
- What?
- I mean, he's the talent.
<i>He's the hero that everyone tunes in</i>
<i>to see each day, not me.</i>
<i>Only problem is, our hero was standing</i>
<i>in a parking lot 100 feet below the action.</i>
- Yes, I know, but you never saw my face.
- So?
<i>So if you cut in just after</i>
<i>I make the grab...</i>
we use all the coverage I shot
before I got up on the roof.
<i>We lay in Phil's voice-over,</i>
<i>and then we tag it with...</i>
a pickup shot of Phil exiting
the building with the jumper.
We're not long for a two-share and last place
with that kind of attitude. Do it.
- But Chris, it's...
- <i>Unethical?</i>
You heard me.
Make Phil a hero.
- I thought only God rewrote history.
- God never won sweeps.
- <i>[Miss Parker] Beautiful part of town.</i>
- <i>[Sydney] Dangerous.</i>
No wonderJarod left the notebook
with the acupuncturist.
- He doesn't want us down here.
- Come on, Sydney. We're here.
Let's see if Ratboy
left anything behind.
This is futile.
Jarod's long gone.
Afraid of the dark, Syd?
Only when I
can't see what's in it.
<i>[Clatter]</i>
- Damn it.
- <i>[Clatter]</i>
Miss Parker, maybe we should get
the cleanup team to check this place out.
Forget it, Syd.
I'd trade a dozen Ferragamos
for oneJarod any day.
<i>[Object Clangs]</i>
I'm counting to three.
Then I'm going to shoot whoever you are.
One...
two...
<i>Three.!</i>
- What do you want?
- What you got?
I have a nine millimeter
in your face...
and you appear
to have a knife...
a rusty knife.
<i>Oh, you must be feeling</i>
<i>lucky today.</i>
- <i>[Glass Shatters]</i>
- <i>[Sydney Shouts]</i>
[Groaning]
[Chuckles]
Are you feeling
lucky today, hmm?
<i>Get their wallets andjewelry</i>
<i>and let's get out ofhere.</i>
<i>[Keyboarding]</i>
Writing Phil's copy for him too?
I'm just trying to send
a message to an old friend.
<i>So you think I was wrong...</i>
letting Phil take credit
for saving the jumper.
As our new, esteemed news director
always reminds me...
I get paid to cut tape,
not to think.
From what I understand,
you win awards doing it.
Well, awards don't count
for much around here.
Pulitzer's rolling over in his grave,
and Nielsen's packing down the dirt.
Phil has asked me to go over
some of his old footage...
to see how he likes
to be shot.
Do you think maybe you could show me
some of his old tapes?
Yeah.
- Second shelf.
- Great. Thank you.
The Ken Watanabe shooting.
I heard about this.
So has half the world.
And our Ivy League Hitler was pissed
we didn't hook the other half.
It's Chris's job
to know what people want...
and it's our job to
make sure they get it.
Which doesn't mean we should throw out
anything resembling journalistic integrity.
If it bleeds, it leads.
That's the new wave of the news,
Annie, like it or not.
We either surf along with it,
or we get torn apart in the riptide.
<i>[Annie]</i>
<i>It's really an act.</i>
Phil actually worships Cronkite
in secret midnight rituals.
Hmm.
Who's Cronkite?
You're gonna fit in just fine here.
Tonight, exclusively
on Seattle's Channel 43...
our continuing series
on local gangs.
<i>In this shocking footage,</i>
<i>our own cameraman, Ken Watanabe...</i>
<i>captured on videotape</i>
<i>a gang gathering...</i>
at the North Puget dock area.
But what happened next
took us both by surprise.
Out of nowhere,
the 15th Street Bleeders...
crashed the turf
of the Burns...
leading to
an explosive conflict...
a conflict in which one of
our own became a casualty.
- Oh, God, I'm hit. Oh, God. Oh, God.
- [Gunfire]
Phil, where are you?
Phil, I'm hit. I'm hit, man.
<i>My arm. My arm. I can't move my arm.</i>
<i>Get me out ofhere, man.</i>
- Get me out of here.
- Come on. Come on.
<i>Come on. Get up.</i>
Tonight, our prayers
are with Ken Watanabe...
a courageous young cameraman.
God bless you, Ken.
<i>Phil Campbell,</i>
Channel 43 News, <i>at 10:00.</i>
<i>Dehlila, I think about you</i>
<i>so much, my brain hurts.</i>
I have to meet you,
to see you.
- <i>[Phone Rings]</i>
- Samson.
I mean, Broots.
Mr. Parker?
Uh, Mr. Parker, sir.
How-How can I help you, sir?
Uh... Uh, no. No, sir, I haven't seen
your daughter since yesterday.
Sydney neither.
I mean, either.
Y-Yes, sir.
I'll get on it right away, sir.
- Yeah, well, it's a pleasure talk... talk...
- [Click, Dial Tone]
Hello? Hello?
- <i>Jarod.!</i>
- <i>Dave?</i>
You look great.
A step at a time.
That's what they tell me.
I just came by to say thanks.
Of course,
the way that story aired...
- I don't know if I should thank
that reporter Phil or you.
- [Laughs]
Well, strange things happen in TV.
I'm glad you're doing well.
I don't know what got into me.
Did you find
your wife and kids?
Yeah, but she doesn't want me back
until I find a job, so...
- I'll keep my eyes open.
- Yeah.
- What do you keep looking at?
- Oh, those wires there.
<i>If they're planning on hooking up</i>
<i>that satellite dish to them wires...</i>
they're gonna blow out their
electricity in nothing flat.
- You're an electrician?
- Nope. Satcom grunt.
I wasn't any better at jumping out of airplanes
than I am from buildings...
but I do know a wiring problem
when I see one.
Hey, thanks again, really.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Phil, these pieces
are excellent.
Twenty years of broadcasting
will do that.
I was especially impressed with
the Ken Watanabe segment.
I was wondering. Is the raw footage
lying around somewhere?
I'd love to see
how it was cut together.
Most of those tapes
get recycled.
Even with a piece this good?
<i>Yeah, well, the station didn't use</i>
<i>to charge me for parking either.</i>
Yeah, right.
- Way to go, Dave.
- <i>[Chattering]</i>
[Grunting]
[Pipes Clanking]
As if getting mugged
wasn't enough.
[Weakly]
You shot me.
I did not shoot you.
It was an accident.
I never liked guns.
I hope you'll stop
carrying yours now.
[Sighs]
- You're bleeding again.
- [Groans]
- I need something else to tie this wound with.
- What about that neck scarf?
- It's one of a kind, Sydney.
- [Chuckles]
Which is what my good leg will be
if we don't stop the bleeding.
[Shuddering]
I'm sorry.
[Groaning, Grunting]
[Sighs]
- Thank you.
- <i>You're going into shock. You need to be warm.</i>
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Sydney.
<i>Don't look now, but we are</i>
<i>ground zero for detonation...</i>
to bring this dump down.
Please tell me that you told someone
where we were going.
[Sighs]
[Cooing]
There's something
I don't understand.
- What's that?
- Where are the little ones?
<i>The what?</i>
You always see the big pigeons,
you know, with the scars...
<i>and the broken wings</i>
<i>and the missing legs.</i>
<i>But you never see</i>
<i>the little ones.</i>
- I never really thought about it.
- Hey, I know you.
You're the cameraman
that was on the news.
- I'm Jarod Crane.
- Ken.
That was incredible
footage you captured.
Thanks. I never planned on
becoming a story though.
When are you going
back to work at the station?
<i>And do what?</i>
<i>Log commercials?</i>
I'm a shooter, man.
My days on the front line
are over.
You know, it's funny.
You plan for your life to go up one road...
and when you finally get there,
the bridge washes out.
Well, you never know.
Life has a strange way
of surprising you.
Hey, look at that.
<i>[Ken]</i>
<i>I'll be damned.</i>
Like I said,
life is full of surprises.
<i>[Beeping]</i>
Ken Watanabe and Phil Campbell,
February 18, roll number one.
Okay. Uh...
Nothing fancy, Kenny.
We're just gonna go in there...
and we're gonna sit down,
and we're gonna listen to the Burns...
talk about their side
of this turf war.
These guys tend to talk with their guns.
Know what I'm saying?
You don't have to worry
about getting fancy from me.
Don't worry about it, Ken.
You'll be fine.
[Exhales]
Let's do it.
[Ken] You sure these guys
are gonna show?
[Phil] Yeah, they'll be here.
Don't worry about it.
Okay, um...
Right up there. Head there.
[Ken] You been hanging with
the homies, Phil, huh?
Yo! Hey, D-Mac!
Hey, D-Mac!
Bleeders in the hood!
[Gunfire Resumes]
- [Tires Screeching]
- I'm hit! I'm hit! Oh, God!
- My arm! My arm!
- [Gunfire Continues]
I'm hit, man! Phil,
get me out of here, man!
- Get me out of here! Get me out of here!
- You're okay.
Get me out of here, man!
Get me out of here! Get me out of here!
<i>Interesting undershirt, Phil.</i>
Flak jacket standard issue
for a street reporter now, Phil?
I'm dying for a cigarette!
<i>How the hell</i>
<i>did I end up here?</i>
You regret taking on
theJarod assignment?
- I regret a lot of things.
- Such as?
I regret not going to the prom.
<i>I regret laughing</i>
<i>at my first boyfriend...</i>
when he told me I was the one.
<i>And in this instant,</i>
<i>I regret not having...</i>
a nicotine patch
the size of a doormat.
[Groans]
Oh, no.
Your ulcer, huh?
And no medication.
[Sighs] Ladies and gentlemen,
the fabulous Sherlock Holmes.
[Groaning]
Let me see it, Sydney.
Regret's often born out
of a lack of choice, you know?
Unlike you, Syd, I don't think
that everything is out of my control.
You do when it
comes to your father.
Please, don't...
don't misunderstand that.
Why don't you just say it?
I caved.
I always do around him.
You can still walk up
to your father and tell him...
<i>"Dad, I'm leaving. '"</i>
<i>[Chuckling]</i>
[Chuckling]
Right. I can see it now.
Two kids,
a little yellow house...
chitchatting with the girls
over lattes at the mall.
You still have a future,
Miss Parker.
It's a hell of a future,
sitting here waiting to get blown to bits.
[Chuckles]
[Laughing]
Here I am, trying to comfort you.
[Laughing Continues]
As if anything you could ever do
would give me comfort.
It did once.
You are one hell
of a thrower, Jarod.
It's about understanding
the projectile's aerodynamics.
Well, actually,
I just close one eye and let it fly.
- Oh.
- That's it. Good game.
I should've warned you.
I don't like to lose.
- Good man.
- Next round's on me.
[Patrons Cheering]
Phil certainly is
in a good mood tonight.
You must be very proud of Annie and Phil getting
nominated for the Ken Watanabe segment.
Yeah, even stiffs like Phil get lucky.
If only Grecian Formula were talent.
<i>Awards help the promo guys, I suppose.</i>
<i>They also make a news team lazy.</i>
News is about being hungry.
Always has been.
You guys gonna drink water all night,
or are you coming to join the real party?
And you, smile.
<i>[Laughing]</i>
- Is this about Ken?
- He should be here.
Somebody forgot to invite him.
[Inaudible]
<i>He must've been very proud,</i>
<i>taking one for the team.</i>
<i>[Chris] KTJE's got a hell of a medical package.</i>
<i>Watanabe's all right.</i>
<i>Ken's gonna be fine.</i>
<i>Look, everybody in this business knows...</i>
that putting your tail on
the line is a job requirement.
<i>Ken was green.</i>
<i>He was too zealous, and it cost him.</i>
If I'd have known how dangerous it was,
I never would've let him go out there.
I'm sure you wouldn't.
I'm not trying to be a pest, but I've got the
Tower breathing down my neck to find them.
Now surely there's got to be a Sweeper team
somewhere near the New York City area.
Excuse me? What business is it of yours
what my clearance level is?
- Now, listen. You S.I.S. guys
are really startin' to tick me off.
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
Hold on a second.
Just hold on.
- Broots!
- It's me.
Don't bother trying to trace me.
- I've scrambled the source signal.
- Jarod?
- I've been trying to contact Sydney.
- Join the party.
He and Miss Parker went looking for you two
days ago. We haven't heard from them since.
She's too persistent for her own good.
You're going to have to find them.
You don't know how peaceful
it's been here without her.
Would it be more peaceful
working for Raines?
- Mr. Raines? No.
- Take down this address.
1811 North Bushnell Street,
the Bronx.
[Crying]
[Soft Chattering]
Miss Parker?
Tell me again
how my mother died.
Stop torturing yourself.
I know it wasn't suicide.
Was she murdered because
of the rescued children?
- I don't know.
- Was it my father?
Miss Parker, I know about your mother's life,
not about her death.
<i>She was a kind woman...</i>
a driving force at the Centre in those days
when it was still involved in...
altruistic projects.
I can't believe the Centre
was ever involved with anything positive.
We helped four countries become
democracies during the cold war.
<i>We brought the sides together</i>
<i>for the Korean Peace Accord.</i>
And rumor has it that we even
helped design the Popemobile.
<i>The Centre</i>
<i>saved thousands oflives</i>...
lives that
they later reclaimed...
as it turned out,
in other ways.
Why didn't you leave
when things turned?
<i>There were others</i>
<i>whose welfare...</i>
was of more concern to me
than my own.
Jarod.
He's not very different from us,
you know?
<i>We'd all have taken</i>
<i>very different paths...</i>
had we had our way.
- Here you go. Pass the ball, man.
- [Chattering]
- Boo-ya!
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
I think that was traveling.
You must be crazy,
stupid or both.
No, no. After you lifted your pivot foot,
you took more than the allotted two steps...
as outlined in
the official rule book.
- Mmm.
- Pizza?
Thank you, anyway,
but it already comes presliced.
Help yourselves.
- What, you got a death wish or something, man?
- Not that I know of.
Didn't your mama ever tell you
that white people shouldn't...
go walking through
other people's neighborhoods?
Well, I never actually knew my mother,
so I guess the answer is no.
My name's Jarod Crane.
I'm with <i>Channel 43 News.</i>
I'm looking for a D-Mac.
- You gonna put him on TV?
- Quite possibly, yes.
- I'm D-Mac.
- Nice to meet you.
<i>Ow.! He's got game.</i>
<i>The boy's got some game.</i>
[Chattering]
Hey, man, that camera guy
shouldn't have been there.
- Tell me what happened.
- <i>A man hits my cell phone.</i>
He must've paid somebody
off to get the number. Sounded white.
Tells me he wants to talk about
the turf wars. Sounded cool to me.
This white man that called you,
is that unusual?
You really didn't have
no mother, did you?
I never knew my old lady either.
<i>Later I heard word the Bleeders</i>
<i>got the same call.</i>
<i>They show up, and boom, boom,</i>
<i>the fireworks started.</i>
Do you remember what day
you got this call?
I don't know.
Hey, Duane, man, bring my Day Runner.
We're bangers, not cavemen.
Thanks, man.
Okay, here you go.
February 18, at about 8:00 at night.
Could you tell me
your cell phone number?
<i>[Chattering]</i>
[Crying]
- Take Miss Parker upstairs.
- Yes, sir.
You get some rest now.
- If you ever want to talk to me, I'm always here.
- [Crying Continues]
- Okay?
- Thank you, Sydney.
Sydney?
Why is everyone wearing black?
How come you're so sad?
We're remembering someone
who has left us, Jarod.
Is it the woman that got shot
in the elevator?
Miss Parker's mother, isn't it?
Don't you ever speak of that
to anyone ever again, understand?
[Groans]
I could've saved him.
Who?
Jarod.
He should have lived
a normal life.
- They would've killed you.
- [Chuckles]
You can't kill someone
who's already dead.
<i>[Shuddering]</i>
You do remember.
You broke into my edit file
and stole footage?
"Borrowed" is more like it.
- And I did it for Ken Watanabe.
- You lost me.
- Ken was set up.
- What are you talking about?
What happened to Ken happened
because Phil is desperate for ratings.
l-l-I don't buy that.
Buy it.
Why else would Phil have been wearing a
bulletproof vest the night that Ken was shot?
You actually think Phil would do
something like that?
I'm certain of it.
Annie, you know him.
You've seen the kind of pressure
that Phil has been under to get back on top.
Yeah, but to risk
somebody else's life.
He's a desperate man, Annie.
He was the king of the hill,
and now he's on his way out.
Annie, I need your help
to stop him.
<i>Hello, Dave. This is Jarod.</i>
How would you like to
come to work for Channel 43?
Uh-huh. You can tell your wife
you've got a job.
<i>[Rap, Indistinct]</i>
Lights.
<i>[Continues]</i>
Camera.
Hello, Annie. I'm setting up
a very special screening in Chris's office.
I want you to do me a favor.
Make sure the general manager is there.
Action.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Phil.</i>
Chris just got word of a summit going down
between two rival gangs.
He thinks it's going to make a terrific
follow-up to the Ken Watanabe segment.
Chris tipped you on this?
His snitch said there could be fireworks,
and fireworks mean ratings.
Let's go.
Phil, why don't
you test your headset?
Check, one, two.
So, where shall we set up?
Over here.
We can cover the door,
stay in the shadows.
Uh, Jarod.
Something doesn't feel right about this.
Well, it's a pretty scary place.
That and the fact that Ken Watanabe
was shot just outside of that door.
That might have something
to do with it.
<i>But putting our tail on the line</i>...
<i>it's part of thejob, isn't it?</i>
Okay, Jarod. Jarod?
- Jarod!
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
- <i>[Man] Burns in the house.!</i>
- <i>[Man #2] Word.!</i>
[Men Shouting]
- Bring your punk-asses out!
- <i>Let's go.!</i>
- Don't wait for their asses.
- Jarod, where are you?
<i>[Jarod On Headset]</i>
<i>Above you.</i>
<i>[Phil]</i>
<i>This is not good.</i>
<i>[On Headset]</i>
<i>It's okay. I've got you in my sights.</i>
<i>Smile, Phil. It's showtime.</i>
Annie, why is
the general manager here?
I think you have
a meeting with him.
Mr. Ferren, what a surprise.
Nice to see you again,
Mr. Ferren.
Show's about to begin, gentlemen.
Please take your seats.
I'm intrigued, Rockwell. This must be
some show you've put together.
Yes, sir. The best.
[Men Shouting]
- <i>[Man On TV] What?</i>
- What you want with me?
- What's up, fool?
- <i>[Mr. Ferren] What is this, a gang fight?</i>
- Want some of this, huh? You want some of this?
- <i>[Chris] Is that Phil?</i>
- <i>What you got?</i>
- Jarod, these guys are gonna kill each other.
- <i>[Jarod] It'll be great TV.</i>
- You call me here to threaten my ass?
This is on you, dog.
Deal or die.
[Chattering]
<i>This is great stuff, Phil.</i>
<i>Get closer so we can pick up sound.</i>
I've got no cover here,
you idiot!
I'm getting out of here.
<i>[Jarod] Don't leave now, Phil.</i>
<i>You're gonna miss the story.</i>
<i>[Man] You want some of this?</i>
<i>Huh? You want some of this?</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Or maybe you are the story.</i>
- [Banging]
- What the hell is this?
- <i>[Banging]</i>
- He's mine!
- Jarod, help me! Jarod, help me!
- <i>Jarod.!</i>
- <i>[Men Chattering]</i>
- Jarod, help me!
- Yeah!
This is great.
This is great. Keep it up.
Look what we got here, fellas.
Uh-huh.
Dave, ready to go citywide?
Get ready, Seattle.
[Men Whooping]
- So what we gonna do with this white punk?
- [Men Grumbling]
I say we bury his sorry ass
right where he stands.
- [Clicking]
- [Grumbling Continues]
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Hey, it's on every channel.</i>
<i>[Man #2]</i>
<i>Something's going on. Look at this.</i>
<i>[Jarod] This is gonna be a great piece,</i>
<i>Phil. Just keep them talking.</i>
<i>[Men Chattering On TV]</i>
This guy's gonna shoot me.
- Just like Ken Watanabe?
- What?
<i>Jarod, come down here.!</i>
What's up? You gonna do the deed
or not? 'Cause if you're not...
- [Guns Cocking]
- No, no, you can't shoot me! No, you can't!
He's got a TV camera on you.
Cameras.
They can do wonderful things.
But Ken Watanabe's camera
couldn't stop him from getting shot.
I didn't know there was
gonna be shooting.
But you did know that a rival
gang was going to be there...
because you tipped them off...
<i>and that's why you wore</i>
<i>a bulletproof vest.</i>
I tipped them off.
Okay, okay!
<i>[Jarod] You knew you were putting</i>
<i>Ken Watanabe in danger...</i>
but you didn't care because
all you care about is getting the story.
Yes! Please, help me!
<i>I can't do that, Phil.</i>
It's ratings at all costs.
Like you always say,
"If it bleeds, it leads."
I set him up. I set him up.
I set it up, okay?
- You got what you need, bro?
- <i>It's a slam dunk.</i>
I got everything
I need right here.
[Men Laughing]
"I set him up! I set him up!"
[Voices, Indistinct]
That was the money shot
you've all been waiting for.
Jarod Crane,
<i>Channel 43 News,</i> reporting.
[Crowd Murmuring]
I'm holding you responsible
for this, Mr. Rockwell.
Forget the liability this
station faces in light of this.
You ruined a man's life.
- Sir, l...
- Save it. Save it.
You want a news flash, Chris?
You're fired.
[All Murmuring]
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
Miss Parker! Sydney!
- It can't be.
- Sydney! Miss P.!
- Broots! You moron!
- <i>Miss Parker.!</i>
<i>Down here.!</i>
Sydney, wake up.
[Chattering]
Hi.
How're you doing?
I figured you guys might be hungry.
Forget that.
Does anybody smoke? Smoke?
- No.
- No.
Hi. Uh, can l...
Thank you.
Boy, it's lucky
I found you guys.
Otherwise, you would've been toast.
<i>You can put any fantasy about me</i>
<i>thanking you to rest, Broots.</i>
[Huffs]
Right.
[Chuckles]
So, what did you guys
talk about all this time?
Nothing.
<i>Nothing at all.</i>
[Huffs]
You're welcome.
This is great.
I don't know how to thank you.
- <i>I mean, you built this harness for me...</i>
- [Chuckling]
<i>and got me myjob back</i>
<i>at the station.</i>
You've got to promise me that
this will never make the air.
I promise.
Well, you're gonna have to
send me the video.
- That's what you do, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.
- Good luck, huh?
- Take care.
[Woman Over Headset]
We got you covered down here, Jarod.
This could be
a new world record.
Now, that would be news,
wouldn't it?
[Mews]
I can't see anything.
I need to go lower.
The child is just
below you, Jarod.
<i>Collapse is imminent.</i>
<i>You have to abort.</i>
I can save him, Sydney.
I can save him!
- You have to abort.
- No!
<i>[Young Jarod Yelling]</i>
<i>No.!</i>
You're dead.
- I coulda done it.
- <i>What? Save him?</i>
You can't save everyone, Jarod...
<i>no matter how hard you try.</i>
[Squeaking]
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Jarod Halstrom. [Chuckles]</i>
He was the coolest Ph.D.
we've had in this place.
He had a private grant, rented the lab
from the university...
and paid me <i>mucho dinero.</i>
- What kind of research were you doing?
- Nada.
All we did was eat Pez,
watch Frankenstein movies and play with mice.
- <i>The live ones anyway.</i>
- Live ones?
Yeah, half of them
were dead or comatose.
See, Jarod used to
inject them with something...
<i>and then stare at them for hours.</i>
It was kinda ghoulish.
<i>Then he donated his little critters</i>
<i>to the school when he left.</i>
<i>Except for this white one.</i>
<i>Jarod called him Jacob.</i>
Jacob?
- Hmm?
- Nothing.
Well, Jarod used to carryJacob around
in his pocket like it was his best friend.
- They're distant cousins actually.
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>
<i>I have to get that.</i>
<i>No dead fireman or wounded cameraman.</i>
<i>Maybe he's getting bored.</i>
Mm-mmm. Jarod will never be bored
in the outside world.
He's trying to save lives.
<i>[Siren Wailing]</i>
We have a female,
late 20s, leg fracture...
<i>possible vertebral fracture</i>
<i>with internal bleeding.</i>
We started her on an I.V.
of normal saline, wide open.
She's coding! Move!
Come on, come on, come on.
Stay with me!
Stay with me!
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>[Elevator Bell Dings]</i>
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Uh, Miss Parker, have you seen Sydney?</i>
- Do I look like a leash?
- <i>He's, uh, he's missing.</i>
Sydney's missing when he's here.
Well, actually, he was
a no-show at the sim lab.
He left four sets of twins
twiddling their, uh, 16 thumbs.
Sydney's a no-show
for a roomful of human bookends?
[Quietly]
Security reported some drugs missing...
from the Centre
pharmaceutical lab.
A nurse says she saw Sydney
leaving there early this morning.
- <i>[Elevator Bell Dings]</i>
- I'll talk to you later.
<i>[Elevator Bell Dings]</i>
- [Chattering]
- Your daughter needs you.
[Chattering Continues]
- Trauma five, stat.
- She has a little girl.
Okay, we'll take it
from here, Jarod. Jarod.
- She has a little girl.
- Someone get him off my patient.
Jarod, we're done.
<i>[Water Running]</i>
- All right, let's go.
- I'm gonna stay here for a while.
- She's goin' into surgery.
- I know.
I just wanna make sure
she's all right.
Oh, no, no, no. Look.
Okay, I've been only driving with you,
what, a couple weeks, right?
Take my word for it.
You get too personal with a client...
that's just energy
you can't spend saving the next one.
All right? We do our best
for these people, then we move on.
You can't train yourself to think that way,
this job will kill you.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Not if I do it first.</i>
Why don't I have proper treatment reports
on your last five deliveries?
- Deliveries?
- <i>Dr. Fletcher, meetJarod Randolph.</i>
I hope your partner's better at driving them in
than he is at doing his paperwork.
I will get to that paperwork
when I get a break, all right? I promise.
You better.
[Beeping]
<i>[Miss Parker] Sydney made</i>
<i>quite a heist from the Centre pharmacy.</i>
<i>Cylin, triphenylmide...</i>
d... uh...
Diflutazenil.
Uh, a reversal agent...
a neurostimulant
and an antidepressant.
Huh.
Great. Great.
Now Sydney will turn up in some hop house,
and we'll loseJarod's trail again.
Start decrypting his files.
Maybe there's a clue there.
- Uh... Um... [Clears Throat]
- <i>[Keyboarding]</i>
You're... You're invading my space.
Close is good.
<i>[Chattering]</i>
Why is there a severed animal's limb
hanging from your rearview mirror?
- It's a rabbit's foot.
- Technically, it's a paw.
What, you mean you've never seen
one of those before?
- It's lucky.
- Not for the three-legged rabbit.
<i>[Dispatcher, Indistinct]</i>
Sure, yeah.
Coffee time.
<i>Would you guys keep it down?</i>
<i>I'm trying to sleep here.</i>
You might get more rest
if you turn down your music.
Self-hypnosis.
Trying to study while I sleep.
<i>The New England Journal of Medicine.</i>
I'm impressed.
Yeah? Tell the admissions board
at Atlanta.
<i>I am out of the E.M. T. business</i>
<i>come this fall, with a little luck.</i>
Have you tried a rabbit's foot?
- I'm a four-leaf clover person myself.
- <i>Oh, man, Vargas is here.</i>
- Who's Vargas?
- Max Vargas, State Board of Inspection.
I didn't think the inspection
was going to be for another two weeks.
This guy is a bigger pain in the ass
than the suits at the hospital.
<i>Are those the same pains in the ass who</i>
<i>call me at home looking for their paperwork?</i>
You must be Randolph.
What's it like being independently wealthy?
- I beg your pardon?
- Well, you've been here a month...
and you haven't done your W-4, so you must
have a little nest egg stashed away somewhere.
It must have slipped
through the cracks.
Well, it's my job
to fill in those cracks.
Maybe you and I should go
to the office and fill these forms in...
so the books
have a semblance of order.
<i>Oh, uh, Mr. Vargas, Jarod and I</i>
<i>have a union-guaranteed coffee break now.</i>
You'll be using it
to fill out these forms.
I'll have them on your desk
first thing in the morning.
See that you do.
<i>[Rolling Thunder]</i>
It's sweet that you
talk to him, Sydney.
- Some people think they're not aware.
- Hmm.
He needs to know he's not alone.
- <i>[Monitor Beeping]</i>
- <i>Jacob.</i>
I have discovered
this experimental research...
the Halstrom Technique.
<i>Jarod sent it to me.</i>
<i>It's a long shot,</i>
<i>but it's our best hope.</i>
I promised you...
I would never give up.
- <i>[Honking, Crashing]</i>
- [Young Jacob] Sydney! Sydney!
<i>[Monitor Beeping]</i>
<i>[Mr. Chambers Reading]</i>
<i>"While Sydney Carton...</i>
<i>"and the Sheep of the prisons</i>
<i>were in the adjoining dark room...</i>
<i>"speaking so low</i>
<i>that not a sound was heard...</i>
Mr. Lorry looked atJerry
in considerable doubt and mistrust."
[Jarod] He's a stockbroker from Alpharetta.
His name is Jerry Mitchell.
Queen of Mercy, this is Unit 45. We've got a
male, mid 50s, possible head trauma, you copy?
Queen of Mercy?
County General's closer.
Queen of Mercy's got
the best Head Trauma Center in Atlanta.
I understand that,
but this gentleman needs immediate...
Stabilize him.
I'll do the driving.
We could have had him in treatment
at County eight minutes ago.
Hey, our stockbroker
couldn't be in better hands.
- That's worth eight minutes of his time.
- I hope you're right.
I made a judgment call.
You got a problem with that?
No. No problem.
[Clears Throat]
Nothing obvious on Sydney's e-mail.
Phone records
are all Centre related.
You'd think he'd occasionally call
a 900 number to spice up his life.
What about his regular mail?
Medical journals,
<i>Plant World</i> magazine.
- <i>Book of the Week Club.</i>
- Give me that.
Annual donation
to the Mount Pleasant Home.
An historical society maybe?
It's where he goes
for Christmas every year.
Dr. Corey.
I owe you an apology.
<i>I should have relinquished the gurney.</i>
<i>Once we're in the E.R., it's your patient.</i>
Don't sweat it, Jarod.
At least your heart was in the right place.
<i>By the way, that young mother</i>
<i>you brought in is going to be fine.</i>
That's wonderful.
I'm not used to seeing an E.M.S.'er
get so personally involved.
I find it difficult not to.
Sometimes I feel like
I know what my patient is going through.
I know what you mean.
Is that why you're
following up with Steven?
<i>I've seen this injury</i>
<i>a hundred times...</i>
<i>and I'm usually able</i>
<i>to stabilize the patient, but this one</i>...
<i>It's like I pulled out</i>
<i>all the stops...</i>
but he still got away from me.
<i>Steven is lucky to have a doctor</i>
<i>that cares so much.</i>
Are you okay?
It's just that you can't always help them enough,
and I don't like that feeling.
Well, I think
that goes with the job.
It doesn't make it
any easier to live with.
You're not thinking of transferring
someplace else?
There's a research position
at Cornell Med.
I'm thinking I'll have an easier time
dealing with the mice.
Don't be so sure about that.
Look, do yourself a favor.
Really think about your decision.
This hospital
needs people like you.
"It is a far, far better thing
that I do...
<i>"than I have ever done,</i>
<i>"it is a far, far better rest</i>
<i>that I go to...</i>
<i>than I've ever known. '"</i>
How about a break
before we start the next book?
- <i>He likes Dickens.</i>
- Dickens is hopeful.
Even his saddest endings
are uplifting.
I brought you some cocoa.
<i>Appreciate your visits, Jarod.</i>
<i>You'd think you'd get enough</i>
<i>ofhospitals in your line of work.</i>
<i>Well, this hospital</i>
<i>could use some more volunteers.</i>
How's Steven doing?
<i>They started him on a new treatment</i>
<i>called the trefoil therapy.</i>
It was developed at Yale. It delivers
neurostimulants directly to the hypothalamus.
Um, I have a friend
who's in a coma.
They say it has
a 20% success rate.
<i>One out of five comes out of it.</i>
- And four don't.
- He fits the profile.
<i>They said if anyone</i>
<i>would accept the treatment...</i>
<i>Steven would.</i>
He's a fighter.
- <i>Right, hon?</i>
- Right.
Do you mind?
So, Steven was a wrestler.
Took first place in the state finals
his senior year.
<i>He was behind in two</i>
<i>out ofhis five matches.</i>
But he came back.
Pulled it out.
Well, you must be very proud.
He never gave up.
We'd cheer him from the stands.
<i>I think hearing us</i>
<i>made him try harder.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I haven't been in many hospitals...</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I haven't been in many hospitals...</i>
but I really do believe
that people in a coma...
they hear everything
that goes on around them.
Enjoy the cocoa.

I can't keep covering for you

I've had personal business.
You never kept secrets from me.
Sydney, l...
I have ethical concerns about our work.
Don't start with that rubbish.
We're not doing anything wrong.
- Open your eyes, Sydney.
- <i>They are open, Jacob.</i>
I see the opportunity to do
what we've been working for all our lives.
Get your mind off of your career for one second,
will you? I'm talking about the children.
<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
[Jarod]
Hello, Sydney. Any progress?

<i>Halstrom's Technique, it's just brilliant.</i>
It could help

How's Jacob?
Nothing yet, I'm afraid.
Tell me, Jarod.
Why are you doing this?
The medical profession.
It's about the relief of suffering.
Remember?
[Phone Beeps]
[Whistling]
Hey, Jacob. Jacob, how you doing?
How you doing?
<i>Did you have a good day? Hmm?</i>
- Dr. Corey, good morning.
- Hey.
I wanted to check on the status of the stockbroker
that Rennert and I brought in yesterday.
We damn near had to
life-flight him to County.
I thought this hospital had the best
Head Trauma Unit in the city.
Head Trauma was downgraded months ago,
along with a third of our budget.
You guys should keep up
with current events.
What's with her?
She's like you.
She cares too much.
[Chuckles]
I can't wait till Thursday.
- What happens on Thursday?
- My transfer came through.
- I am out of the E.R.
- Sarah.
They need you here.
[Chuckles] Look, I have been
through this with everyone I know.
I'll give your regards
to the mice.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Let's go.! Let's move.! Right in here.!</i>
- <i>[Woman] What do you got?</i>
- [Chattering]
<i>[Woman On P.A.]</i>
<i>Dr. Fletcher to Administration, please.</i>
<i>Dr. Fletcher to Administration.</i>
Sydney.
- So, who's Mr. X?
- None of your business.
Your business is my business.
Jarod can wait.
I can't. Go pack your bags.
You're coming with me.
You are not welcome here.
All I have to do
is call the Sweeper team.
Mm-hmm.
I have priorities.
<i>[Monitor Beeping]</i>
Who was on duty last night?
Who was on du... Somebody was here
last night? Who was on duty?
Don't you have that
in one of your files?
- If I did, would I ask you?
- What did you lose?
There's some personnel files missing,
including yours, I may add.
Well, I'm not going to
fill out any more paperwork.
You won't have to,
Randolph. Jarod.
<i>Born in Seattle.</i>
<i>Attended Millbrook Elementary.</i>
Photographic memory.
And I'm sure I have
enough in here right now...
to run a background check on you.
I'm thinking about going into pediatrics.
What do you think?
I think a doctor needs
to have a strong sense of ethics.
What?
Hey, where we going?
- <i>[Jarod] Trying out a different route today.</i>
- <i>Different route?</i>
Mm-hmm. Peachtree Athletic Center
to Queen of Mercy Hospital.
<i>It's interesting. There are two</i>
<i>other hospitals that are much closer by.</i>
Neither one of them
are Queen of Mercy.
- What are you talking about?
- Ethics.
Steven Chambers was injured
during a wrestling match.
You and Rennert took him all the way from
the athletic center to Queen of Mercy Hospital.
Explain to me
why a seasoned E.M. T...
would take a critical patient
so far out of the loop.
Jarod, we did
the best we could.
By my calculations,
it takes at least 25 minutes...
to get from the athletic center
to Queen of Mercy.
What exactly did you do for him?
Watch him fall deeper into a coma?
Rennert made the judgment call.
I looked at Rennert's record
for the last five years.
He took at least 30 patients
to Queen of Mercy Hospital...
that should have gone
somewhere else.
Thirty patients
with expensive injuries...
that have insurance
to pay for it.
God knows how many other people
ended up like Steven Chambers.
<i>A doctor has to</i>
<i>have ethics, Julie.</i>
<i>People's lives are in their hands.</i>
There had been a... a Hawks game that night,
and we hit the spillover traffic.
We just sat there.
All I could do was to talk to Steven,
you know, try to keep him awake...
while Rennert kept telling me,
"We're doing the right thing."
You could have filed
a complaint against him.
<i>It was my first week</i>
<i>under the reds, Jarod.</i>
It took all the guts I had just to tell him
we were going the wrong way.
Rennert, he warned me
never to second-guess him in his rig.
<i>I didn't want any trouble.</i>
I just... I just
wanna help people.
<i>[Raines]</i>
<i>Broots.</i>
Mr. Raines.
Where are they?
Who?
l-I'm not sure.
Um, that is, l-I know
where I think they might be.
- Tell me.
- Well, uh...
They weren't very specific.
They both just took off without saying much.
How's your little girl?
You know, uh...
they... they did say something
about the Mount Pleasant Home.
Sy-Sydney goes there
from time to time.
I know where he goes.
[Nurse]
I've increased the dosage.
You're aware it's three times more
than you originally requested?
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.
I had no idea.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Not many people do.</i>
Sydney, what happened?
<i>[Young Jacob]</i>
<i>I'm talking about the children.</i>
What's so troubling about children,
for God's sakes?
- Do you know how we got those children?
- I know what I need to know.
No, no, you know what the Centre
wants you to know.
<i>You</i>... <i>You always do this.</i>
You always push away what doesn't fit
into your pristine view of the world.
And all you wanna do
is poison the good things in your life.
- <i>Sydney.!</i>
- [Crash]
<i>[Raining]</i>
Jacob. Jacob!
Jacob!
- Jacob!
- <i>[Sydney] It was my fault.</i>
<i>I knew the road,</i>
<i>knew every curve.</i>
Sydney, it could have
happened to anybody.
Uh-uh.
A later simulation byJarod
suggested otherwise.
I should be the one
lying in that bed.
[Monitor Beeping]
<i>[Monitor Beeping Faster]</i>
Jacob.
Jacob, are you there?
Jacob.
""I should not let you
depart from me thus.'
""You should, lady, and I know you will,'
rejoined the girl, rising.
"You will not stop my going
because I have trusted in your goodness."'
<i>It's a lovely story.</i>
<i>I'm eager to see how it turns out.</i>
For the best, I'm sure.
I brought you some coffee.
Thank you.
I don't think
he's going to wake up.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Don't say that.</i>
I've given up hope.
I know Richard has too.
He just won't admit it.
There's still so much you could try.
The hospital therapy...
It failed.
The treatment's run its course.
Did they try
increasing the dosage?
Increasing, decreasing, diluting.
It's just not working.
There's another therapy
I know about.
It's called Halstrom's Technique.
You can't give up.
Steven's fought so hard.
There's a boy in Cleveland.
He needs a heart.
We're trying to
decide what to do.
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>it would take a miracle.</i>
Just in case,
I want to finish this with him, so...
he knows how it ends.
<i>""Of what use then is the communication</i>
<i>you have made, 'said Rose.</i>
"This mystery
must be investigated."'
Jacob.
[Sighs]
- I can save him!
- You have to abort.
I can save him, Sydney.
No!
- You can't save everyone, Jarod.
- Well, I had to try.
- [Sighs]
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- Yes.
- Sydney.
Halstrom's Technique...
it's flawed.
The effect is only temporary.
Thanks, Jarod. Thanks.
I have, uh, tried to
come here as often as I can...
but my work
keeps me occupied.
I miss you.
Were you aware all this time?
<i>Jacob, the night</i>
<i>of the accident...</i>
it stayed with me.
<i>I promised you I would do everything</i>
<i>in my power to bring you back.</i>
You shouldn't be lying here.
You didn't deserve this.
SL-27?
- Why wasn't I told?
- It doesn't concern you.
It's Centre business.
- Is he awake?
- I'd like my question answered.
- Answer my question.
- He's awake.
- Is he talking?
- Not yet.
- Don't let him.
- Sir?
Jacob is a threat
to Centre interests.
You have an obligation
to protect those interests.
Do you have a problem with that?
- No, sir.
- A Sweeper team...
will be sent
to assure you don't.
Make sureJacob
never wakes up again.
<i>[Rolling Thunder]</i>
<i>[Phone Beeps]</i>
Hey. Another day
on the lifeline, eh, Jarod?
Hmm.
Mr. Rennert, would you leave
Mr. Randolph and me...
- alone for a moment?
- We were just about to start our shift.
You and I are gonna have to cover a little
ground before I let you out on the street again.
All right.
<i>I ran a background check on you,</i>
<i>despite your lack of paperwork...</i>
<i>and some interesting data</i>
<i>spewed forth.</i>
<i>Because the onlyJarod Randolph</i>
<i>I could find in the state archives...</i>
weighs 286 pounds...
<i>and he's black.</i>
It's time you put
your cards on the table, mister.
<i>I can't even verify</i>
<i>that you're trained for this job.</i>
And despite the mountain of phone calls
that I've received praising you...
I need to know that the people
you're assisting are in the right hands.
Well, I guess my luck just ran out.
Gimme one good reason
not to call the cops.
[No Audible Dialogue]
So, I heard that, um, Vargas rode you
pretty hard last night, huh?
I think there's gonna be
some changes in this unit.
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Unit 45, this is Dispatch.</i>
<i>We have a cyclist down on the corner</i>

<i>Pupils are uneven.</i>
<i>We should C-spine him.</i>
Look at that. Guy can afford a Rolex,
you think he'd invest in a helmet.
Guess I'm the lab rat now,
huh, Doc?
<i>[Groaning]</i>
Sydney's in the lounge.
Keep an eye out.
Mr. Raines insists I watch.
- <i>[Plastic Gloves Crinkling]</i>
- We're done here.
He slipped back into the coma.
He wrote something down first.
I'm happy for you.
Somebody paged me?
- <i>That was me, Dr. Corey.</i>
- Oh.
Here.
- What is this?
- Jarod wanted you to see this.
Steven Chambers?
A case can be made for negligence
on Rennert's part.
You may want to listen to this.
[Siren Wailing
On Walkie-Talkie]
[Rennert]
Uh, Queen of Mercy, this is Unit 45.
We've got a down cyclist,
uh, possible head injury.
Queen of Mercy?
Grady Memorial is a faster run.
I'm not going through this again, all right?
Queen of Mercy's my call.
Rennert, this guy
is fading on me.
Then you keep him alive till we get
to Queen of Mercy! Come on!
[Chattering]
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Coming through, people.</i>
[Knocking]
What are you doing here?
- Hey.
- Hmm.
Is this what someone's life
is worth to you?
<i>Hey, I don't know</i>
<i>what this is about.</i>
This is about you
and this ambulance driver...
endangering the lives of patients
so you can cash in on their insurance.
<i>It's about watching</i>
<i>a young man's lifejust fade away.</i>
Steven Chambers trusted you.
You didn't care about his life.
All you care about
is what's inside this envelope.
No, no, no, this is a setup, man.
This is not fair.
What's not fair is Steven Chambers's parents
are gonna have to unplug the machines...
that are breathing life
into their only son.
- I'm outta here.
- Come with me, sir.
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you doing? Hey! Hey!
Oh, man.
- Thi...
- Oh, Rennert.
You might need this.
"I have said that
they were truly happy...
"and without strong affection
and humanity of heart...
<i>"and gratitude to that being</i>
<i>whose code is mercy...</i>
and whose great attribute is benevolence
to all things that breathe..."
We need to do this.
<i>"Within the altar</i>
<i>of the old village church...</i>
<i>"there stands</i>
<i>a white marble tablet...</i>
"which bears as yet
but one word: "Agnes.'
"There's no coffin
in that tomb;
<i>"and may it be many, many years</i>
<i>before another name is placed above it.</i>
<i>"But if the spirits of the dead</i>

All done.
It's good that Oliver

- Darling.

Godspeed, my son.
[Sobbing]
[Takes Deep Breath, Exhales]
You were right, Sydney.
Well, I have to
get back to work.
So, you're staying.
Who wants to be around
a bunch of mice anyway?
- Where you going?
- Cleveland.
<i>[Female Dispatcher]</i>
<i>Airlift four, what's your E. T.A.?</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Uh, we'll be touching down in 15 seconds. Out.</i>

<i>[Monitor Beeping]</i>
- Any change?
- No.
Since he, uh, slipped back
into the coma...
there's been nothing.
- It's not fair.
- What isn't fair?
Some people, they just fight so hard,
but they just don't make it.
Oh, you can't save
them all, Jarod.
You may be a Pretender,
but you're human.
Right.
Halstrom's Technique...
did it help at all?
It helped enough.
[Phone Beeps]
[Mews]
- <i>Previously on</i> The Pretender.
- Mama!
- They're trying to hurt her!
- Mama, no!
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>
- Bring Jarod back.

- I'm not afraid of your father.
<i>I have reason to believe my mother</i>
<i>may have rescued these children.</i>
[Fly Buzzing]
You know, Gator Heaven has
the finest gator wrestling...
<i>in all of South Florida.</i>
<i>In fact, we produce more wrestling champions</i>
<i>than any other roadside attraction.</i>
- That's Jarod?
- Can you believe he mastered
gator wrestling in a week?
- A regular Tarzan.
- <i>Gave 'em all nicknames too.</i>
Called the one with the sharpest
teeth Miss Parker.
Been gone about a month.
Did he leave anything behind?
Like a red notebook?
He left somethin' better.
- Said this was for you.
- Beautiful.
Genuine native art.
Handcrafted by the tribe.
In Taiwan?
Eastern tribe.
Lovely, Jarod.
Another game.
Said if you wanted it,
you had to sign for it.
Thank you.
No. Jarod said the pen
was for you too.
[Sighs]
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>There it is.</i>
Now come on, bubba. We gotta
relocate this prehistoric handbag...
<i>before the hurricane evac.</i>
- Reports got it comin' in pretty fast too.
- It's still a few hours off.
<i>It's hard to believe a day this beautiful</i>
<i>is gonna turn into a storm.</i>
Well, if you're in a hurry,
I could wrestle it for you.
- What? The gator?
- Yeah.
- You lost your mind, bubba.
- I used to wrestle for the Seminoles.
- Florida State?
- No. The tribe.
- Come here, girl.
- Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
How do you know
that's a she?
I know that smile.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
Miss Parker,
you're to come with me.
Daddy, the next time
that you want to see me...
you don't have to send
the welcome wagon.
<i>You're here at my invitation,</i>
<i>not your father's.</i>
<i>You've been busy.</i>
I don't follow you, sir.
I follow you.
<i>What was in</i>
<i>the safety deposit box?</i>
Nothing, sir.
Let me rephrase, Miss Parker.
I know it was Mommy's box.
<i>What did you find in it?</i>
<i>[Wheezing]</i>
I was looking for answers.
About what?
About how she died.
- <i>Your mother shot herself.</i>
- Daddy.
Leave us, Mr. Raines.
Don't I get a hug?
[Laughs]
Been too long.
So, how are things
at the summer house?
Are the leaves coming back?
Slowly. You know how
spring can be up there.
Stubborn. Your mother
always got impatient.
I don't remember
that about her.
But l...
I do remember this.
You look like her.
Watching you...
in some ways she never left.
Daddy, I want to know
what happened to my mother.
- I'm disappointed in you.
- <i>You're</i> disappointed in <i>me?</i>
Don't tell me
you believe this crap.
But I remember that Thanksgiving!
The fight that you had.
And a few months later,
she was dead.
Don't let your emotions
run away with you.
I taught you better.
Just tell me what happened.
I killed her.
At least, that's what
I torture myself believing.
When someone you love
commits suicide...
you search for answers to the mystery
you don't understand.
That's what you're doing now.
I miss her.
You were young. There's no way you
could've known what she was going through.
<i>It was a sad time.</i>
<i>I don't know why she left us.</i>
Don't you think I miss her too?
Of course.
You can believe your father orJarod.
Who's it going to be?
Daddy, I want
a new assignment.
Jarod is Sydney's mess,
and Mr. Raines's.
Please put me
back in corporate.
- We have our arrangement.
- I know.
You were a quiet,
uncertain little girl...
and now you're this...
presence.
It's time for my treasure to shine!
I know what you're capable of.
Do you?
I do.
And our deal stands.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Florida? I was there yesterday.</i>
<i>[Broots] I know. You just</i>
<i>weren't south enough.</i>
While you were away, Broots and I revisited
the old notebook from the Atlanta site...
and we found some clues.
Global coordinates
written in it that lead us to...
Hurricane Cassandra. Top wind
speeds of 150 miles per hour.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>When Jarod was in Atlanta...</i>
<i>Cassandra was just</i>
<i>a badly formed tropical depression.</i>
<i>He must have predicted</i>
<i>its course.</i>
Jarod put himself
in the path of a hurricane?
Someone from Marine Patrol in Bahia Grande
is using the Centre's access code...
<i>to hack into Defense Department</i>
<i>weather satellites.</i>
It's the same one I'm using.
- <i>[Phone Rings]</i>
- Tech room. Broots.
Uh... [Clears Throat]
No. Yes, sir.
Uh, right here. Hold on.
It's for you.
Yes.
Of course.
Very clear.
- Who was that?
- It was personal.
- How fast can we get down there?
- Uh, a couple of hours.
But they're already starting to evacuate
people from South Florida.
Then I'll go with Sam.
<i>Miss Parker, it isn't safe.</i>
lfJarod's really on that island,
I have him right where we want him.
- Who was on that call?
- Mr. Raines.
<i>[Helicopter Approaching]</i>
<i>[TVAnnouncer]</i>
<i>Residents and merchants of Bahia Grande...</i>
<i>are frantically boarding up windows</i>
<i>and packing cars this afternoon.</i>
<i>Cassandra is expected in four to five</i>
<i>hours, around 7:00 p.m. this evening.</i>
- <i>Islanders are being reminded</i>...
- I'm gonna be out... out front.
<i>But don't worry, Simone.</i>
<i>We'll get you to the doctor real soon.</i>
Hey!
- Battening down the hatches?
- <i>I'll tell you what.</i>
My cracker butt is gonna sell this place
and move to Oklahoma after this one.
For what? Tornadoes?
- Okay. California.
- Earthquakes?
Somewhere 'sides here.
How's she doing?
Fever's not breaking.
[Sighs]
You better hurry up.
Jarod, are you sure you should've pulled
Simone out of that facility?
They were going to ship her
back to Haiti.
I can't believe Bartlett would do that...
just let her folks die in a storm.
People will do all kinds
of things for money.
I'll see that he gets paid.
<i>Jarod, forget about him.</i>
Come go with us. I, uh...
- What is it?
- I'm just...
I'm not very good
around sick people.
I watched my old man
have a heart attack.
I knew he needed C.P.R.
or something, but I froze.
I just... I watched him go.
I can't handle the responsibility.
The analgesic I gave her
should help with her fever.
All you need to do
is drive her to Miami.
The doctors
will take over from there.
You can do it.
I trust you.
[Sighs]
If you say so.
- <i>Jarod.</i>
- Hi.
- It's empty.
- No more candy.
Doctor's orders.
But I'll get you some more...
as soon as we see
your family in Miami.
I promise.
[Whispering]
I'll see you in a bit.
<i>[Thunder Rumbling]</i>
Are you gonna help me
with this cage?
<i>I can't, sir. I just got this download from</i>
<i>the State Department of Law Enforcement.</i>
<i>They suspect that the parents of the Haitian</i>
<i>girl were killed around Harrison Marsh.</i>
They want evidence gathered
before Cassandra washes it away.
Let me see that.
Hmm. Uh, why don't you finish up here,
and I'll take care of this.
- I'll go with you.
- No. I can handle it.
<i>[Thunderclap]</i>
- <i>[Woman] No.!</i>
- <i>[Man] I won't let you do it.!</i>
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Don't.! You're hurting me.!</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Come back here.!</i>
<i>[Thunder Continues]</i>
- <i>[Creaking]</i>
- <i>[Thunderclap]</i>
Faster, Sam.
Okay. We're gonna be leaving
here in just a few minutes.
Okay?
<i>[Thunder Continues]</i>
Boo!
Damn it! You scared
the hell out of me.
[Shouts, Grunts]
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- <i>Hey.! Hey, bubba.!</i>
What the hell is this? Are you gonna
stand there or cut me out of this?
Cut you out? I spent
a long time making that thing.
You rigged this net?
Think of it as a bag.
<i>A trash bag.</i>
You cut me out of this now,
or I'll blow you away!
Most criminals, they smuggle
drugs or stolen cars.
- Do it!
- You trade in human life.
You smuggle Haitians, and then
you charge their families in Miami.
- [Gun Clicks]
- <i>And once you get them here,</i>
<i>you raise the price.</i>
Now that's ransom,
pure and simple.
And if they can't afford to pay,
well, you just let 'em die in a storm.
<i>Kinda like the one that's coming now.</i>
You got no proof of nothin'!
I sent it to the State
Department of Law Enforcement.
<i>Simone's family, theyjust</i>
<i>wanted to start a new life.</i>
But you took that
away from them.
And that little girl, she
doesn't have a mom and dad...
because you locked them out here
in a shack to die in a storm.
As the shack collapsed
around them...
<i>her parents threw themselves</i>
<i>on their daughter.</i>
They died trying to save her life!
Do you know what it's like
to grow up without parents?
Hey, hey! Bubba, wait, wait!
You can't leave me out here!
This hurricane'll kill me!
Oh, no, it won't.
You're about three miles
north of the damage path.
At least I think so...
- bubba.
- Hey! Hey!
Hey! Come back here!
You can't leave me here!
You're dead! You're
dead, you son of a... Jarod!

- Just in case it doesn't...
why don't you tell me

Tell me who I am.
Maybe I should send you to every Y.M.C.A.

- [Laughing]
- So you got the medical report.
I have what you forgot.
You didn't come here

<i>What did Daddy tell you</i>

- That's enough!
- I bet it wasn't the truth.
Yeah, well, the truth is
you're a liar! Always have been.
You faked that medical report.
I wouldn't fake

aren't you?
<i>Well, not anymore.</i>
<i>Now I make the rules.</i>
<i>[Thunderclap]</i>
[Grunting, Muttering]
<i>Hold on.</i>
<i>You're such a good, good girl.</i>
How many merit badges
did <i>this</i> get you?
You don't think that rescuing
children is a good idea?
<i>Your mother certainly</i>
<i>thought it was.</i>
<i>[Thunderclap]</i>
The leading edge just passed.
<i>The eye wall should hit</i>
<i>in about 17 minutes.</i>
- <i>Honey, wake up.</i>
- That's the worst part.
- Jarod, I can't wake her.
- Let me take a look at her.
- Sam can do it.
- Sam is not a doctor.
l... I can be. Please!
<i>[Thunder Continues]</i>
Simone? It's me.
Simone.
<i>Talk to me. Come on.</i>
<i>Simone? Simone?</i>
If he tries anything,
shoot him in the foot.
Simone? Simone,
can you hear me?
<i>[Thunder Continues]</i>
- <i>[Woman] No.!</i>
- <i>[Man] Listen to me.!</i>
- <i>Stop.!</i>
- <i>I know what you're doing.!</i>
- <i>You're hurting me.!</i>
- <i>Where are you going? Come back here.!</i>
[Creaking]
She's dipping in and out
of consciousness.
I need to get her fever down.
The infection is spreading.
She needs penicillin.
I can get some from the first aid
kits at the boathouse.
- <i>Across the island?</i>
- After the storm,
while you're on your way to Blue Cove...
I'll make sure she gets
the best specialists.
There is no time. She could go
into septic shock or a coma.
I need to get her the penicillin.
<i>The eye should be here</i>
<i>in a few minutes.</i>
That will give us
about 20 minutes of calm.
- How can you be so sure?
- Jarod used to be a weatherman in Puerto Rico.
Mama, Papa,
pouvez-vous me voir?
Simone, tout va bien.
Tout va bien.
- What's she saying?
- She's looking for the sky.
<i>Her mother told her before she died that</i>
<i>she would look after her from the sky...</i>
that the sun and the moon
would be her eyes.
I'm going to the boathouse.
Are you going to let her die?
Sam, cuff him.
I'm going with you.
Pat, try to keep her temperature
under control while I'm gone.
<i>I'm counting on you.</i>
<i>So is she.</i>
<i>[Thunder Continues]</i>
You're doing the right thing.
Call me Mother Teresa
from now on.
- It doesn't suit you.
- What?
This facade you put up.
You try to act like your father,
but he's not who you are.
This is business,
Jarod, not personal.
- <i>No matter how hard you try</i>
<i>and make it that way.</i>
- It's personal to me.
Then why can't you leave
my mother out of it?
Because she tried to rescue me
from your father.
- <i>[Tree Falls]</i>
- [Tires Skidding]
What now?
<i>It's less than a mile.</i>
If we move fast,
we'll beat the eye.
It sure would be
a lot easier without these.
You try anything, and I'll put
a bullet through your knee.
I thought it was my foot.
Fever's not breaking.
Come on, kiddo.
Work with me.
Why are you afterJarod?
Shut up and watch the kid.
- I need more ice.
- I'll get it.
[Quiet Muttering]
Jarod, what's taking so long?
<i>I've got it. There's still plenty of time.</i>
<i>Simone's gonna be okay.</i>
<i>Honey, I'm home.</i>
[TVAnnouncer] Cassandra clocked
at speeds up to 160 miles an hour...
- You heard from her?
- [Continues, Indistinct]
No. I'm concerned.
- <i>So am I.</i>
- <i>Oh, you are?</i>
Mr. Raines
ordered her into that.
Do you have a problem
with Raines?
He is out of control.
<i>Raines isn't. Jarod is.</i>
Tormenting my daughter
with lies about her mother.
- Lies?
- <i>You saw her last.</i>
You knew her condition.
Her only option was suicide.
Mrs. Parker, God rest her soul,
was manic-depressive.
Her marriage was falling apart...
and, of course, there was
the question of her beating.
Exactly what did she say
about that?
I can't disclose that.
But you know psychiatrists,
Mr. Parker.
We write everything down.
So do I.
Your wife was my patient.
The details of her sessions
are privileged.
I have privileges, Sydney.
I'm well aware of that.
[Mr. Parker On Speaker]
Anything else, Doctor?
[Sydney]
No.
<i>[Jarod] That rope</i>
<i>was tougher than I thought.</i>
Looks like it cost you a molar.
Two. Now shut up!
You never had to clean up
one of your messes, have you, Jarod?
<i>You should've met that cop</i>
<i>you framed in Miami.</i>
- What a whiner!
- I told you to shut your pie hole!
Listen... Goober.
The Centre will pay you...
Shut up! Shut up!
I don't give a damn
about the Centre.
Soon as this storm
is outta my face...
we're takin' a little
boat ride out to the swamp.
But I'm the only one
comin' back.
Tonight you two
sleep with the manatees.
<i>[Thunder Continues]</i>
<i>[Simone Moaning]</i>
<i>Mama, Papa,</i>
<i>pouvez-vous me voir?</i>
Hey, hey. Shh, shh, shh.
She... She can't
keep any food down.
Let me make her some juice.
The vitamins will do her good.
<i>[Thunder Continues]</i>
<i>Hey.!</i>
You scared me.
Stop wastin' time.
Your crusade for the little guy
is backfiring.
How does it feel
to face the consequences?
I spent an entire life
simulating reality.
Consequences?
They feel pretty good.
Jarod, what did you mean when you said
my mother tried to save you?
She was planning on smuggling me
out of the Centre.
You were one of the children
she tried to rescue?
<i>She died before she could</i>
<i>get to me or the others.</i>
Others?
<i>She had a list of seven children.</i>
The unlucky ones.
And where did you get this list?
The medical report wasn't the only
thing in the safety deposit box.
The medical report is real.
[Shudders]
I remember my parents
fighting that night.
<i>She went off the deep end.</i>
<i>Wouldn't even wear her wedding ring.</i>
It was a bad time for my father.
How can you still trust him?
I never saw him hit her.
<i>Ever.</i>
- <i>[Glass Shattering]</i>
- <i>[Blow Landing]</i>
[Creaking]
I never saw anyone.
Not that I can remember.
<i>People repress memories.</i>
Especially traumatic ones.
<i>Unless something</i>
<i>helps bring them out...</i>
<i>like a</i>...<i>a smell... or a sound.</i>
I used to sell power memory tapes
on late-night cable.
Perhaps you missed that one.
Let me help you.
Thanks for the offer,
but I can take care of myself.
<i>[Thunder Continues]</i>
[Loud Groaning]
[Groaning]
[Raines]
If you were so worried about her...
you should have gone with her.
She only went
because you intimidated her.
Miss Parker is doing her job.
I'm glad to see someone is.
What happened to you?
Too many cigarettes,
not enough vacations.
When you were Dr. Raines,
you were my colleague.
I never detected this obsession.
I don't have to follow
the Hippocratic oath anymore.
My only directive
is to bring Jarod back.
For that to happen,
Miss Parker needs focus.
She has a lot of issues
on her mind.
She's always been a curious girl.
Takes after her mother.
<i>Weather Service says the eye</i>
<i>just passed the island.</i>
We could... We could...
[Clears Throat]
We could be there by morning.
Get a jet.
<i>Come on, Broots.</i>
We wouldn't want any harm
to come to Miss Parker.
That's it.
A little tangerine,
a little key lime.
<i>Good for the soul.</i>
But you're still burning up.
Come on, Jarod.
- <i>Where are you going?</i>
- To get some more.
<i>Looking for this?</i>
<i>Okay. Time</i>
<i>for a little boat ride.</i>
Ladies first.
[Grunts]
[Groaning]
[Grunts, Groans]
- [Chuckles]
- Drop it!
[Laughing]
That's a flare gun.
It's gonna redefine heartburn
unless you drop it.
- [Groans]
- Where'd you get that?
I snuck it into the first aid kit
when you weren't looking.
[Panting]
You were gonna use that on me.
I still am.
<i>Try gumming through this.</i>
And you are going to have to dislocate
a lot more than your thumb...
to get through that.
Why did you save my life?
Because... I still remember
the little girl...
who gave me my first kiss.
<i>[Thunderclap]</i>
<i>[Thunder Continues]</i>
<i>[Shutter Banging]</i>
[Creaking]
- <i>[Woman Screaming]</i>
- <i>[Glass Shattering]</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>I know what you're doing.!</i>
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Leave me alone.!</i>
[Creaking]
- Mama.
- Mama.
It's okay, sweetheart.
Mama's all right.
Mr. Raines.
Hey.
- Hey!
- What?
Don't you people keep a spare key
to that cage around here?
Yes, we do.
It's in that Miami Heat
ashtray on the desk.
Trick is getting there.
Look, we both want
to catch Jarod, right?
Oh, yeah.
<i>So you just flip your cage</i>
<i>over a few times.</i>
You help me catch him,
and you won't just get paid.
I'll make sure that
you get a sweet reward.
[Grunting]
Put some muscle into it!
- [Grunts]
- Yes!
<i>[Bird Squawking]</i>
Ahh.
So, when do I get
that sweet reward?
[Chuckles]
Now.
- [Grunts]
- [Groans]
Storm's clear. We'll be landing
in five, Doctor.
- Jarod.
- Where's Miss Parker?
<i>I said, where is she?</i>
<i>She had a date.</i>
Drop it and stand
against the wall!
She needs this.
What are you going to do, Sam?
You gonna kill me?
I don't think you have
the authorization to do that.
- <i>[Glass Shattering]</i>
- Whoa!
- [Laughs]
- Thank you.
I should've done that sooner.
- Simone.
- Jarod.
This'll hurt just a little bit...
but I promise you...
it's gonna make you feel a whole lot better.
Storm is over?
Yes. It's over.
<i>[Helicopter Approaching]</i>
Help!
[Grunts]
He's a maniac. A maniac!
He tried to teach me a lesson. He thinks
he's some kind of one-man judge and jury!
- Where is he?
- That way. By the front desk.
Out. Bungalow 32.
It's way, way, way to the back.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Suckers.
<i>[Helicopter Rotors Whirring]</i>
Ready?
<i>Your mama and papa</i>...
<i>They can see you now.</i>
[Laughing]
I was close, and I learned a few things
that are going to get me even closer.
The status quo remains?
We have our deal,
but it's not quite status quo.
How so?
No more surveillance.
No lie detectors.
No more games.
You second-guess
my work again...
I'll put a bullet
in that pet oxygen tank...
and they'll have to
clean you up with tweezers.
I catch Jarod my way.
And once he's
in the Centre, I'm gone.
That's the deal.
Are we clear?
[Strained]
As a bell.
[Breathes]
I'll see you later, Daddy.
Good to have you back.
<i>[Miss Parker Reading] "My dearest daughter,</i>
<i>this ring was your great-grandmother's.</i>
<i>"If something should happen</i>
<i>to me, I leave it for you.</i>
<i>Maybe you'll have</i>
<i>better luck. Mom. '"</i>
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- What?
- Did you get the ring?
<i>[Miss Parker On Phone]</i>
<i>Yes. Thank you, Jarod.</i>
[Jarod On Phone]
Did you find your answer?
I think I know who killed my mother, but right
now I'm more concerned with why she died.
It was for the children.
For you, Jarod.
The way I see it,
she died trying to save you.
- You're angry.
- I won't stop chasing you.
And I won't chase
my past anymore.
What if it chases you?
I'll ignore it.
- You make the rules.
- That's just the way I like it.
Nice boots. Snakeskin?
Mm-mmm. Gator.
[Mews]
- <i>[Woman] Previously on</i> The Pretender.
- <i>[Sydney] SL-27.</i>
<i>What does it mean, Jacob?</i>
<i>[Miss Parker] I believe my mother</i>
<i>rescued some of the children here.</i>
- [Man] Rescued?
- It's a long story.
- You have a problem with Raines?
- He is out of control.
When you were Dr. Raines,
you were my colleague.
I never detected
this unholy obsession.
You didn't look
hard enough.
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Tonight on</i> The Pretender.
[Young Sydney] Very good work, Jarod.
You're making progress.
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>Sidney? Who's that? Who's that boy?</i>
<i>Another test subject.</i>
He's working
with another doctor.
- <i>What's his name? Can I talk to him?</i>
- <i>No.</i>
- But I don't have any friends.
- You won't be seeing him again.
<i>Sydney, where are</i>
<i>they taking him?</i>
<i>Yeah. This is Garrison.</i>
<i>Flight 1701.</i>
Tell the Oklahoma office we have their
witness, sealed and ready to deliver.
Remind them we've got better things to do
than escort their chameleon.
Got that? Yeah. 1701 out.
Still no update
on Eugene's locale.
That's all right.
We'll find him...
just as soon as we finish playing escort
to the Man of a Thousand Faces.
Come on!
Let's go in there.
<i>Hey, Lon Chaney,</i>
<i>hurry it up in there.</i>
Ho! Marshal Cody.
How do I look?
Well, it's a face
only a mother could love.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
Oh, God.
Unpucker your sphincter,
Broots. It's just me.
Miss Parker, I didn't... [Clears Throat]
hear you come in.
And how's your little
John Tesh fan?
Fine. She's-She's fine.
I'll, uh... I'll tell her
you said hello.
Um, is there something
on your mind?
I need a personal favor.
From me?
Is it possible to run
a global Internet search...
without anyone
from the Centre knowing?
Oh, I guess, yes.
But if they...
If they, uh, catch you,
they'd crucify you.
Why? You want me to see
if someone's been doing it?
I want you
to do it for me.
No. No, I couldn't do that.
Please.
[Sighs]
Okay.
These are missing children
from the late '60s.
Names, birthdays, physical attributes,
some photos.
Nobody can see this.
Do not scan these pictures
and don't transmit them over the Internet.
- But...
- If you find anything, find me.
Well, if it isn't the Keystone Kops.
[Chuckling]
We spend our lives keepin' mob snitches
alive, and all we get is grief.
There's a bunch of guys with flat noses
that would like to get their hands on you.
With Marshal Cody here...
never happen.
<i>Unlike you and Garrison,</i>
<i>he's never lost a witness.</i>
Oh, yeah? Well, all I know is
the quicker we dump your butt...
the sooner we can
get back on our case.
<i>[Garrison] Cool it, Lane.</i>
<i>Marshal Cody's just tryin'to do his job.</i>
Let's go in the back
and get you somethin' to drink.
- You're a fun guy.
- [Laughing]
Did I miss something?
All the marshals in D.C.
were laughin' about it.
Heard about it
during my holdover.
One of their witnesses... a guy named Diggs...
he bolts on their watch.
Well, in this business,
that sort of thing happens.
That's only half the story.
A couple of weeks before that,
this Diggs's partner...
<i>he cuts up Garrison</i>
<i>with a homemade knife...</i>
<i>and then takes a dive from 30,000 feet</i>
<i>during the plane transfer.</i>
Must have been pretty embarrassing
for the Marshals Service.
Now you're catching on.
I thought you must have heard about it.
I've been busy.
[Tones Beeping]
- [Line Clicks]
- Dr. Shafton?
Sydney. [Sniffs]
I need to see you.
Lane.
Look, I know it must feel
like a slap in the face...
the service transferring me
into the middle of your case like that.
Nothing personal, but we were doin'
just fine without you.
Look, this Diggs thing
just has me on edge. That's all.
I'm here to help.
Mind if I take a look?
<i>In three days, Eugene Diggs is supposed</i>
<i>to testify against the Arellano cartel.</i>
<i>If we don't get him back, the government's</i>
<i>case goes south and these drug runners walk.</i>
We'll get 'im back.
We're not gonna break for chow
till we do.
"S-P-A-M."
What's it stand for?
America.
If we hadn't shipped that stuff to England
during World War II...
the Beatles would've
sung in German.
I imagine the sound of an insect vocalizing
in any language would be fantastic.
Do you mind?
Mmm. It's delicious.
<i>[Lane] Are we gonna go talk</i>
<i>to Eugene's wife or not?</i>
Beats himself up
over everything.
That's one bad habit
I can't get that kid to shake.
<i>Come on.</i>
Diggs and his best friend, Jimmy Rayford,
owned a little air cargo company in Arkansas.
Business was in trouble, soJimmy
makes a deal with the Colombians...
to fly some special cargo.
Now, Eugene, who trusts
Jimmy with his life...
thinks they're haulin' coffee beans.
Of course,
Jimmy's runnin' cocaine.
D.E.A. nails 'em, so we got them
to testify against the cartel...
for reduced sentences...
case closed.
TillJimmy Rayford tries to attack you
with a homemade knife during an air transfer...
tries to escape by parachuting out
of one of our planes...
and leaves Eugene Diggs
to take the fall.
Bad news travels fast, huh?
Well, I guess the boys in Washington
aren't too happy with you guys.
[Laughing]
They're not the only ones.
How the hell could I
talk to Eugene?
You got your people
camped out in my front yard.
You got my phone lines tapped.
My friends won't even
come near this place anymore.
The truth is we might be
the only friends that you have left.
Now you're not doin'
Eugene any favors by lyin' to us.
Eugene is scared.
Jimmy said these cartel guys were tough, that
they'd just as soon kill you as look at you.
Then let us help you.
Like you helped Jimmy Rayford?
Mrs. Diggs,
we can protect you...
<i>both of you,</i>
<i>from the cartel.</i>
<i>I told you already.</i>
<i>I don't know anything.</i>
<i>He's out there alone,</i>
<i>scared, without a friend.</i>
Who can he trust now?
Jarod, you need to finish
the simulation.
I wanna see the other boy.
You know I can't allow you
to have contact with anyone.
- Fine. Then I can't finish the simulation.
- Why not?
How am I supposed to pretend to do this
if I've never had a friend?
You simulate a lot of things
you've never done before.
I want to see
the other boy, Sydney.
I want to know what it's like
to have a friend.
[Ringing]
- Yes?
- Yeah. It's Garrison.
Diggs's lawyer just came in.
Eugene wants to talk.
I'm on my way.
I hope, for your sake,
your client's callin' to give up.
I put you in contact with him. What,
I have to talk him off the ledge too?
- [Groans]
- Sorry.
I forgot about
your <i>war</i> wound.
- Deputy MarshalJarod Cody.
- Cody.
[Laughs]
Guess that makes me Annie Oakley.
- <i>Here we go.</i>
- <i>[Switch Clicks]</i>
- Eugene?
- <i>How's Helen?</i>
How's my wife?
Have you seen her?
Son, your wife would be
a whole lot better off...
if you'd just stop this nonsense
and bring yourself in.
<i>I can't do that.</i>
<i>Colombians will find us.</i>
That's whatJimmy said.
That's why I ran.
I ain't stickin' my neck out
with nobody standin' behind me.
<i>[Garrison] You forgetJimmy.</i>
<i>The cartel didn't kill him, and you know it.</i>
- Now Jimmy abandoned you.
- <i>No. He got scared.</i>
<i>Jimmy was my best friend, man.</i>
He sold you out, Eugene.
He never told you
about the drugs...
<i>and he tried to run</i>
<i>and leave you to take the rap.</i>
<i>No. He made a mistake.</i>
<i>He was just trying to save our business.</i>
Look, I'm not gonna
listen to this anymore.
You loved Jimmy, didn't you?
<i>He was like a brother to you.</i>
- <i>Who's this?</i>
- My name is Jarod.
- It's lonely out there.
- What the hell do you know about it?
You've been running,
and you're scared.
You feel like
you can't trust anybody.
Nobody's telling you the truth.
- <i>[Sniffling] I didn't want any of this.</i>
- <i>I know you didn't.</i>
But you can't run forever.
But it's safer for me
and for Helen.
Hey. You tell her
I love her, Jarod.
Eugene.
- Eugene.
- Public phone.
<i>Collinsville, Texas.</i>
[Men Chattering]
Eugene.
- You don't have to run anymore.
- Jarod?
Yes.
It's going to be okay.
- <i>[Lane] He's got a gun.!</i>
- I promise.
<i>[Garrison]</i>
<i>Federal Marshal.! Freeze.!</i>
- <i>[Gunshots]</i>
- He's unarmed!
- <i>We're moving to you, Jarod.</i>
- He's unarmed!
<i>Don't shoot.!</i>
<i>Don't shoot.! He's unarmed.!</i>
Don't shoot!
<i>[Garrison]</i>
<i>Get after him.!</i>
- <i>[Engine Starts, Revs]</i>
- <i>[Man] Hey.! That's my bike.!</i>
<i>I got one dead drug runner, a trial</i>
<i>set to start in 72 hours and now this.!</i>
There goes your perfect record.
I've been combing state
and federal databases.
Every time I get close to someone
with remotely comparable parameters...
I hit a brick wall.
You can pick up women on the computer,
but you can't do this?
No, not if I can't send pictures
over the Internet.
I'm sorry.
[Clears Throat]
Okay.
You age <i>one</i> of the photographs
and send it out.
I wanna know
what this is about.
Excuse me?
It's just that
I'm risking my neck here...
and l... I have a right
to know why.
It's about my mother.
These children may have
had something to do with her death.
So, how'd he look?
Like someone who misses
his wife a lot.
<i>You know, the only thing</i>
<i>he's worried about...</i>
is you.
[Chuckles]
- <i>You two look very happy.</i>
- <i>It's our honeymoon.</i>
Be a year next month.
<i>You always hear about those people</i>
<i>that marry their first true love.</i>
Well, that was me and Eugene.
<i>I never even kissed</i>
<i>another boy.</i>
After the ceremony, we went
down to a little motel in Corpus Christi.
- Looks very nice.
- <i>Oh, it was a rathole.</i>
But it was all we could afford,
so it's... it's special to us.
<i>Eugene doesn't</i>
<i>trust you people anymore.</i>
Because ofJimmy Rayford?
They went to grade school
together.
Some older boys
were beatin' up on Eugene...
and Jimmy came in
and stood up for him.
Got his butt whipped, but, uh,
he saved Eugene from a lot worse.
I can't tell you how many times
I've heard that story.
Well, they were best friends.
Few things
are stronger than that.
Yeah. The one person that Eugene thought
that he could always trust and believe in...
turned him into a drug runner
and sold him out.
But to Eugene,
Jimmy was everything.
You ever think that maybe Eugene
was right aboutJimmy?
Jimmy Rayford jumped off that plane
because he's a coward.
[Scoffs] He tried to hang
everything on Eugene.
That's what kind
of best friend he was.
Mrs. Diggs...
two federal marshals...
they opened fire
on your husband today.
They missed.
Next time, he might not
be so lucky.
[Sighs]
Help me...
so I can help Eugene.
There's a pay phone.
He calls me.
<i>[Sydney] I have never been</i>
<i>so afraid, Dr. Shafton.</i>
Is this about Mr. Raines?
[Exhales]
Everywhere he goes...
everything he touches...
dishonesty, malice.
Well, why haven't you
confronted him?
<i>Raines is a dangerous man.</i>
He may be involved with the murder
of Miss Parker's mother.
And that accident that put
my brother in the coma?
It may not have been
an accident at all.
[Scoffs]
Now... You're making excuses,
Sydney.
I fantasize about killing...
killing him.
Now we've got less
than 48 hours...
before the grand jury convenes.
I want Diggs
back where he belongs...
ready to testify.
I have to find him.
Why? So you can put
a bullet through his head?
- He's a fugitive.
- He's a kid.
- He reached for a gun.
- That's a lie, and you know it.
Why is this case
so personal to you?
I checked the file. There's no connection
between you and Diggs.
What happened the night
thatJimmy Rayford died?
It was my fault.
That's what happened.
I went up into the cockpit
to call in a report.
Next thing I know,
cabin pressure's gone...
<i>and Garrison's layin'there</i>
<i>all cut up.</i>
Lane! Help me!
Bob Garrison gave me my break
into the marshals, and I let him down.
He's not just my boss.
He's my friend.
<i>We found him, Sydney. We found him</i>
<i>on the sublevel elevator goin'down.</i>
You can't escape from there.
I wasn't trying to escape.
I was trying to find my friend.
[Sighs]
Jarod.
I just know, if I saw him once,
I know he'd be my friend.
I don't have the authority.
I'm just tired of being alone...
<i>tired of not having</i>
<i>anybody to talk to.</i>
If I had a friend,
I'd do anything for him.
<i>[Garrison On Videotape] Come on, Jimmy.</i>
<i>We've been talking here for 15 hours.</i>
[Rayford On Videotape]
If I cut a deal with you guys...
<i>you gotta promise me</i>
<i>Eugene's gonna be okay.</i>
He didn't know anything.
I got him into this.
I gotta do right by him, you know?
<i>I'll take the prison time.</i>
<i>You just gotta protect Eugene</i>
<i>from the Colombians.</i>
He's my friend.
<i>[Young Jarod's Voice]</i>
<i>If I had a friend, I'd do anything for him.</i>
So, Agent Cody, is this
your idea of a bribe?
Now why would I want
to bribe you?
Because you think
I've been talking to Eugene.
- I do wanna talk to you about the case.
- Talk.
I got a copy
ofJimmy Rayford's confession.
How the hell
did you get that?
I pretended to be a federal prosecutor
assigned to the case.
I'm kidding.
Garrison had it.
So?
<i>So, Jimmy Rayford asked for a tougher</i>
<i>sentence from the U.S. Attorney...</i>
with the condition that Eugene got
a Witness Protection Program.
- Eugene got it, correct?
- Yeah.
So why would Jimmy Rayford
attack a U.S. Marshal...
and jump out of an airplane
if he had what he wanted?
Have you ever spent any time
in a federal prison?
- Some.
- So then you know it's... it's no Club Med.
So you're saying
thatJimmy Rayford ran...
because he wanted
to avoid jail time.
That doesn't make sense.
Well, tell that to Garrison.
He's the one who took
75 stitches in the back.
[Exhales]
[Videocassette Engages]
Agent Lane had gone
to the forward cabin to radio ahead.
<i>The prisoner asked</i>
<i>to use the restroom.</i>
Once we were in the rear of the plane,
he bent to tie his shoe...
<i>and retrieved a homemade knife</i>
<i>from his sock.</i>
He reached up from a bent position
and lunged at me.
<i>Lunged at me.</i>
<i>And lunged at me.</i>
<i>I made a defensive move, but he caught me</i>
<i>in the back with a downward movement.</i>
Caught me in the back
with a downward movement.
<i>Caught me in the back</i>
<i>with a downward movement.</i>
<i>You can see the point of impact</i>
<i>from the cut in my shirt.</i>
<i>I went down immediately,</i>
<i>and that's when the prisoner escaped.</i>
Reached up from a bent position
and lunged at me.
<i>I made a defensive move, but he caught me</i>
<i>in the back with a downward movement.</i>
<i>You can see the point of impact</i>
<i>from the cut in my shirt.</i>
<i>I went down immediately,</i>
<i>and that's when the prisoner escaped.</i>
This is a terrible tragedy
for the entire Marshal's Service.
Well, Garrison, looks like you
stabbed yourself in the back this time.
[No Audible Dialogue]
Are you sure nobody's been
monitoring your terminal?
[Exhales] As sure as anything
gets around here.
Uh, I disconnected the link
from the Centre mainframe.
This baby, uh,
should be flying solo.
[Keyboarding]
Are those the same clothes
you were wearing yesterday?
Oh. Yeah.
I've been running faces
against the D.M.V. files across the country...
for, like, the last 16 hours, and...
[Clears Throat]
I came up with Dara Landers...
32, lives in suburban Milwaukee.
- Address?
- [Clears Throat] Oh.
<i>I, uh, hope this helps you find</i>
<i>the truth you're looking for.</i>
Thank you.
And take a bath,
would you, Broots?
Mm.
- <i>[Country]</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Try to keep him calm.</i>
[Rings]
- Helen.
- Eugene. I want you to come home, baby.
I miss you so much.
This doesn't make much sense anymore.
Listen, I know.
But I can't trust these people anymore.
They tried to kill me, Helen.
If they even knew where I was...
if they even knew...
we'd never see each other again.
- Eugene, they might already know.
- Why?
What are you talkin' about?
- You didn't tell 'em about me callin' you?
- I'm sorry, honey.
You told 'em I called you?
Why?
'Cause I'm afraid.
That's...
You sold me out, girl. I cannot believe
you did that to me, Helen.
You just sold me out.
But we can trustJarod.
[Line Clicks]
I shouldn't have done this. He's scared,
and I don't know where he's gonna go.
He's gonna go
where he feels safe...
like maybe a honeymoon motel.
<i>Sydney.</i>
Would you tell me more
about these...
violent fantasies
you've been having?
I think about
what Raines did.
Take Angelo.
Angelo was my project...
very special.
That is until Raines twisted him
into something else.
<i>When I think of all the innocent minds</i>
<i>he has destroyed.</i>
Can't you solicit help from someone
from the Centre... the director?
I cannot trust her.
I cannot trust anyone
of authority at the Centre.
What about Miss Parker?
She digs into matters
she shouldn't.
<i>I've warned her several times,</i>
<i>but she won't listen to me.</i>
How does that make you feel?
Angry! Helpless!
<i>What else?</i>
What else, Sydney?
I can't take much more.
<i>[Footsteps]</i>
[Door Opens]
- It's me. It's Jarod.
- You almost got me killed, Jarod.
I had nothing to do with that.
I promise you.
Yeah, well, your last promise
nearly got my head blown off, man.
<i>Look, I understand</i>
<i>why you feel that way.</i>
But you have to trust me.
You people can't protect me,
so I don't need you anymore.
I don't need anybody anymore.
Well, there's somebody
that really needs you.
<i>[Switch Clicks]</i>
You shouldn't have told him.
You should've trusted me...
the way I trusted you,
the way I trusted Jimmy.
- I'm sorry. I was afraid, honey.
- So you bring him here?
No. No, he's not like the others.
You can believe him.
I swear.
I swear.
Oh.
[Crying]
Welcome home.
What the hell
are you doin', Jarod?
You move without me?
You put a civilian into a volatile situation?
You issued a challenge, sir.
I took it.
<i>What's important is Eugene is here,</i>
<i>and he's still your witness.</i>
Now, tomorrow morning, we get on
that plane, and we take down the cartel.
Yeah? Well, he moves first thing
in the mornin'. You got that?
Bring in the wife...
smart move.
When you're on the run,
people you love... people you miss...
they're the most important
things to you.
<i>[Latino Man On Phone] What</i>
<i>the hell are we paying you for?</i>
<i>You don't come cheap, Marshal.</i>
<i>Both of these witnesses</i>
<i>should have been taken care ofby now.</i>
My client is pleased
aboutJimmy Rayford...
but Diggs was never supposed
to be brought in alive.
Well, there were some
unforeseen complications there.
[Latino Man]
It doesn't matter. That plane will land...
but it will be
in a million pieces when it does.
[Garrison] That's what this
remote control is for, right?
It will disable
the electrical system.
- Whatever you say.
- <i>[Beep]</i>
<i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>
Hello. I'm looking
for Dara Landers.
I thought one day
you might come.
- Might come?
- You're Dara's sister, aren't you?
- Her sister?
- <i>You look just like the woman</i>
<i>who gave Dara up for adoption.</i>
Her name was Catherine.
- Parker.
- <i>I'm not sure.</i>
The lawyer was the only one
who knew her last name.
May I speak with Dara?
I assumed you knew.
Dara passed away
two months ago.
Dara was a gifted child.
She graduated college at 17.
She loved the theater,
playing the different roles.
Even when she
was a little girl...
<i>she would make up</i>
<i>an entire world...</i>
<i>and then lose herself in it.</i>
She seemed to have
a very happy life.
We wanted to give her
the best...
that any child
could possibly have.
The lawyer who
arranged the adoption...
do you know his name?
Steinman.
Mm, no.
Uh, "berg." Steinberg.
Michael Steinberg. Yes.
- Do you know where I might find him?
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
He moved away without a word.
Um, I think
it was back in '82.
- And you had no further contact with my mother?
- <i>No.</i>
<i>No, but I remember</i>
<i>that Mr. Steinberg said...</i>
<i>she had a dream</i>
<i>of moving to Europe...</i>
of giving her little daughter
a better life.
That must have been you.
If I may ask...
how did Dara...
Surgery.
Removing her appendix.
One minute, she was just fine.
And the next minute...
What's this?
Oh, uh, Dara had it when...
when your mother
brought her to us.
<i>You can have it if you like.</i>
We wanted all of Dara's friends
to have a memento.
Thank you.
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>
- Jarod here.
- It's Helen.
- l-I'm worried about Eugene.
- Helen, don't worry.
There is no way that Eugene
is getting on that plane.
Garrison and Lane just took him.
They're flying him tonight.
[Beeping]
- Looks like someone's entered the cargo area.
- <i>[Beeping Stops]</i>
[Beeps]
Boss, somethin's up.
The pilot just buzzed me.
He got a warning light.
Someone may have accessed the plane.
Where?
<i>[Clattering]</i>
Heads up, Lane.
<i>See anything?</i>
There's nobody down there,
but there's a panel open.
- Where's the access hatch?
- It's in the back.
- You stay here.
- No. I'm comin' with you.
You remember what happened
the last time.
You didn't know
when to let go, kid.
What's goin' on?
Everything's fine.
Stay in your seats. Thank you.
Give me your piece.
Give me your piece, boy!
<i>That-a-boy.</i>
Is this what happened
toJimmy Rayford?
You just dump him at 30,000 feet
because he was gonna tell the truth?
The truth don't pay
as well as it used to.
Now, I push this button...
two minutes later, this plane
becomes a fireball...
spread all over
the Oklahoma countryside.
<i>[Struggling, Grunting]</i>
Wait here.
Good move, partner.
[Gasps]
Why?
[Out Of Breath]
Economics.
There's no money defending
theJimmy Rayfords of the world.
Grab the parachute.
Take the remote.
Here.
<i>No. Here.</i>
Bitch.
[Gasping]
Bitch.
<i>See, Jarod? Friends</i>
<i>will burn you every time.</i>
[Grunts]
- [Beeping]
- No!
[Airplane Losing Altitude]
Electrical systems out!
Go to reserve!
Mayday! Mayday! This is
U.S. Marshal Flight 1701.
We've lost flight control.
I repeat. We've lost flight control.
Cover her.
- Jarod.
- Garrison and Michaels are working together.
- I'll explain later.
- What are you gonna do?
Tell the pilot to get ready
to pull up hard.
We've got one minute tops!
- [Alarm Beeping]
- We've got 30 seconds!
<i>You got 30 seconds, Jarod.</i>
Fifteen seconds!
<i>[Lane]</i>
<i>We got 15 seconds.!</i>
- Yes!
- [Laughs] All right.
[Exhales]
Well.
I always knew
that would come in handy.
[Exhales]
<i>Well, looks like we finally</i>
<i>got the shackles on the right person.</i>
<i>[Hushed]</i>
<i>Miss Parker.</i>
- I'm packing in the search. I'm out of it.
- Why?
I got results on some of the other
names from your mother's files.
- Most of them are dead.
- Don't you fall apart on me now, Broots.
No. You don't understand.
They died of sudden, unexplained illnesses...
all within the last six months.
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.
- This is bad. This is... very...
- <i>[Shuffling, Squeaking]</i>
- I gotta go.
- <i>[Cell Phone Beeps]</i>
You look upset, Mr. Broots.
Is everything all right?
[Clears Throat]
Tracking Jarod is a full-time job, sir.
<i>And you've been</i>
<i>putting in long hours.</i>
I'm distressed to discover that you took
your computer off the network.
[Wheezing]
It makes me wonder...
if your loyalties
are to this mission...
or some personal endeavor.
l-I don't have
any personal endeavors.
Perhaps
I should reacquaint you...
with the consequences
of lying to the Centre.
<i>[Wheezing]</i>
<i>Broots's actions</i>
<i>are under my authority.</i>
Then I should hold you responsible
for the lack of results.
You can do
whatever you like...
but we won't get any results
until you get out of my way.
I have business to attend to.
We'll discuss this further
at another time.
You know where to find me.
Jarod has expressed
his inability...
to complete the simulation
without another Pretender.
As a result, I've convinced a colleague
to establish new parameters...
for the Pretender program.
Jarod. There's someone
I want you to meet.
Jarod, this is Kyle.
Kyle, Jarod.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Where did they take you, Kyle?
[Locking Case]
<i>[Door Slides Shut]</i>
He buried 'em, Jarod.
You should've been there.
- [Jarod] All right.
- Good luck to you.
Thank you.
So, you two are finally gonna start
your new life together.
- Thank you, Jarod.
- So, who are we gonna be?
Don't worry. Nobody's
ever gonna find you.
I have experience
with this sort of thing.
You're the marshal.
Well, not really.
- Actually, today, I think I'll be a chef.
- [Engine Starts]
[Screaming, Cheering]
[Chattering]
<i>[Woman] Hey, cowboy.</i>
<i>What's your secret ingredient?</i>
Well, now, if I told you that,
it wouldn't be no secret.
Here you go, little lady.
Enjoy.
[Mews]
<i>Previously on</i> The Pretender.
Who am I? Was I bought or was I stolen?
Where are my mom and dad?
<i>It was my fault.</i>
<i>I should be the one lying in that bed.</i>
Mr. Raines, Jarod has been harder
to catch than we thought.
Bring Jarod back,
or I'll get someone who will.
Are we clear?
[Ringing]
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Here's your key, sir. You're in Room 323.</i>
<i>[Bell Dings]</i>
<i>[Loud Clattering]</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Help me. Help me.</i>
Hello?
<i>[Door Closes]</i>
Hello. Hello?
Is there anybody here?
Help me. Help me.
[Panting]
Sir?
Don't you die on me.
[Blows]
<i>Don't you die on me, damn it.!</i>
Don't die.
Come on. Wake up. Come on.
[Woman]
Front desk. Can I help you?
<i>No. Never mind.</i>
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- Yeah.
- I'm downstairs.
We gonna do this hit?
- Hit?
- Don't jerk me around.
We gotta take this guy out today.
Are you in or out?
- I'm in.
- How am I gonna recognize you?
I have a limp.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>Miss Parker is trying to quit smoking?</i>
<i>How?</i>
Nicotine patch. Personally,
I can only applaud that resolve.
<i>Sydney, resolve is one thing,</i>
<i>but homicide is another.</i>
I just got word Jarod made contact?
- How are you feeling?
- Guess.
[Clears Throat]
Okay.
We got a high-priority e-mail
from Jarod...
but it was addressed to Sydney.
- Put it on the screen.
- It was tagged "personal."
- On the screen!
- It's all right, Broots.
I don't have any secrets
from Miss Parker.
Haven't you ever seen
anyone chew gum before?
<i>"Sydney, you're expected at the Twin Cities</i>
<i>Hotel in Minneapolis, Minnesota...</i>
<i>"on the 22nd</i>
<i>for a very special gathering.</i>
<i>May hold key to the past. Jarod. '"</i>
<i>The 22nd is today.</i>
<i>Who else knows about this?</i>
- Uh, no one.
- Can you get the corporate jet ready for takeoff?
Minneapolis. One passenger.
One?
Well, the message was for me.
Well, when it comes toJarod,
there is no "me," only "us."
Oh.
Make it two passengers.
Take this. You'll need it.
<i>[Man] We're around back.</i>
<i>We'll meet you in the alley.</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Check you all out front.</i>
You don't look like
no stone killer to me.
Well, looks aren't everything.
<i>[Mock British Accent] Yes, I'd like to</i>
<i>have a carton of menthol cigarettes...</i>
waiting on her pillow for her
for when she arrives.
Uh, yes, the name is Parker,
Miss Parker.
Oh! Jolly good.
That would be lovely.
Really.
[Chuckling]
Well, thank you. Very good.
Cheers.
[Wheezing Laugh]
- <i>[Phone Rings]</i>
- [Clears Throat]
[British Accent]
Broots here.
Mr. Raines? Uh, sir.
Secur... S-S-Security situation?
Uh, no, I don't, uh...
I don't know anything...
about any, uh, transmissions
concer... concerning Jarod.
<i>Come on in.</i>
How you doin'?
Come on over. Have a seat.
I'll stand.
Mr. Beaulieu offered you a chair.
Hush up, Donny.
<i>You're gonna have to forgive my nephew.</i>
<i>He's young.</i>
<i>He's just full of the devil.</i>
You ever suck a crawfish, Mr., uh...
Doe.
Jarod Doe.
Not that I recall.
Well, it's real simple.
You just rip the head off like that and suck.
I'd like to get this over with
as quickly as possible.
Well, I admire your candor, Mr. Doe.
Ain't enough of it
in the world to suit me.
Reason you was hired...
was you have no past connections
here in New Orleans.
Nobody knows your face.
This, in turn, gives you
no future connections to me.
Now the word is,
you're clean and discreet...
except for that...
picture-taking business.
Guy whacks people and takes snapshots?
What's that about?
Your business is your business...
mine's mine.
I want you to know the fact
that you're a cripple, uh...
has no effect
on my confidence in you.
That's very generous.
Maybe if you hang around, we can get you
a special parking place in front of the club.
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
This old boy's name is Benjamin Worth.
His address is on the back.
Why do you want him killed?
Your business is your business,
and mine's mine.
Twenty-five thousand now...
and 25,000 when it's done.
After confirmation of Worth's death...
you'll get identification
of a second target.
Second target?
Same deal.
<i>I'm gonna send Donny here with you...</i>
<i>to act as my eyes and ears.</i>
Have you got a problem with that
or something?
<i>'Cause if you do, I can make a phone call</i>
<i>and get somebody else in here.</i>
No problem.
I'm your man.
Yeah, I know you are.
[Clears Throat]
What's this?
- I need film.
- Go to a drugstore.
High-speed, S.G.R. 3200,
black and white.
For my snapshots.
Where the hell am I supposed to find it?
That's not my problem.
Pick me up in my hotel in three hours.
<i>My instincts sayJarod wouldn't have</i>
<i>brought me here without a reason.</i>
I don't care about your instincts.
This whole thing is just another one
ofJarod's snipe hunts.
- <i>[Phone Rings]</i>
- [Sighs]
What?
Where have you been?
I've been trying to reach you.
- Broots, calm down.
- Listen, Raines knows.
- Knows what?
- About the transmission from Jarod.
Did you tell him where we are?
No! It's just a matter of time before he
comes down here and he's snooping around.
You know, he's got this place wired.
Broots, where are you calling from?
[Disgusted Sigh]
Mutant.
- Is there a problem?
- Isn't there always?
What the hell is going on?
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>I think I know why we're here.</i>
<i>It's only been</i>
<i>on the market three weeks.</i>
The plumbing's shot,
and it needs a new coat of paint...
but you won't find a safer
neighborhood in New Orleans.
It seems very nice.
- Are you from the real estate company?
- Uh, no, ma'am, I'm not.
Actually, ma'am, I represent a vintage
automobile house in Baton Rouge.
I was wondering...
Do you know this man?
Sonny Herbert.
I haven't seen him in nearly 25 years.
- I'm interested in the car that he's leaning on.
- His pride and joy.
He used to live here.
He had an office down in Fat City.
I don't remember exactly where.
I can still see all those photographs
he had pinned up around his room.
- Photographs?
- Of the kids.
Mr. Herbert was a private investigator.
He specialized in finding lost children.
[Frustrated Grunt]
What could possibly make this trip
more depressing?
[Sighs]
- <i>[Water Splashing]</i>
- <i>[Man Grunts, Laughs]</i>
Oh, I'm thirsty. Come on.
Sweetheart, go get yourself
another Hurricane.
[Coughs]
Hurry back. Go, go!
Hurry up.
Mmm. Ahh.
Hey.
What do you want?
I came here to kill you.
Well, that should work.
But I'm going to need your help.
<i>[Knocking On Door]</i>
Yeah. I'll be right there. Gotta go.
Stay cool.
- <i>I'm telling you, I don't know where it all went.</i>
- <i>No. Listen to me.</i>
Listen to me!
I don't care about excuses.
For $300 a night, I want ice!
[Both]
Hi!
Very funny, Sydney.
I'm sorry?
The cigarettes
that you left on my pillow.
I had nothing to do with that.
Jarod. You told him about the patch,
didn't you?
- I?
- [Both] Doctor?
- Excuse me?
- We didn't realize...
- That you'd be attending...
- The conference.
Excuse me.
I need a very large drink.
- Don't you...
- Recognize us?
- It's Millie Pilcher.
- And Tillie Pilcher.
- <i>We were part of the week-long</i>...
- International study program?
I'm afraid you're mistaking me
for someone else.
- We could never...
- Forget you...
[Both]
Dr. Jacob.
<i>[Sydney's Voice Echoing]</i>
<i>Jacob.!</i>
<i>[Jacob's Voice Echoing]</i>
<i>Sydney.!</i>
We're really gonna do this.
We're gonna whack this guy out.
No, you're gonna stay here
and watch that gate.
Hey, I came here to do the deed,
not play watchdog.
Now you listen to me.
This is not some field trip...
or a correspondence course that you
order off the back of a match pack.
People will die, and when they do...
it will be done by me, my way...
alone.
Is that clear?
Is that clear?
Don't have to get run over by no truck
to get out of the road.
- <i>[Two Gunshots]</i>
- <i>[Thudding]</i>
<i>[Camera Shutter Clicking]</i>
He's dead?
- What the hell are you doing up here?
- I asked you a question.
Yeah, he's dead.
Everything went, um, smooth?
I didn't hear any complaining.
Help me carry him downstairs.
I wanna see the body.
- Are you kidding me?
- What do you think?
Now the next time you get the urge...
to stick a gun in my face...
you better make sure
you pull the trigger.
<i>Help me carry him downstairs.</i>
Why are we stopping?
Gonna get rid of the package.
- Here?
- Uncle Tug's fond of fertilizing this field.
Shovel's in the back.
Jacob spent the next several months
in the hospital.
He was eventually transferred
to a private-care clinic.
- When did...
- The accident occur?
August 2, '67.
- Would you...
- Excuse us?
- It was nice...
- Meeting you.
Thanks for your help.
You shoot 'em, you bury 'em.
Let's go.
Souvenir of a dead man.
- Did you see it happen?
- Not exactly.
Not exactly?
I saw him plant the guy,
but I wasn't there when he popped him.
I work alone.
The pictures will give you
the up close and personal.
I'll take the double prints.
Here's our next target.
This time I want it seen with real eyes.
<i>Understood?</i>
It's your party.
Hey. When do we move?
I'll call you.
- Why does Tug Beaulieu want you dead?
- That's the $64,000 question.
He's only paying me 50.
Hey. Put yourself in my shoes.
You break into my house.
You put a gun to my neck.
You tell me somebody's gonna kill me.
Then you fake my murder, you bury me,
and you give me a straw to breathe through.
- Your point?
- The point is I don't even know
who the hell you are!
My name is Jarod.
Why does Tug Beaulieu want you dead?
Business conflicts.
Conflicts?
I own some jazz clubs.
Beaulieu wanted to buy me out.
- I wasn't interested.
- He's willing to kill for those clubs?
The Quarter's a small place,
but the land's invaluable.
Wait a second.
Where are you going?
Look, you're not the only person
that Beaulieu has a murder contract on.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
[Sighs]
That's my wife.
Y-Your wife?
B-But you were in the pool with...
Separated.
We're in a healing period.
She runs one of the clubs.
I run the other one.
Don't answer the phone,
and don't go in the bathroom.
Well, wait a minute.
Supposing I gotta, you know?
I ain't goin' in this.
[Sighs]
Come here.
Who the hell is that?
That's the guy that was really
going to kill you.
Um... ice bucket will be just fine.
Good.
I've had the building on the market
a couple of years.
Haven't had much interest
since Mr. Herbert went away.
<i>I'd have cleared out</i>
<i>the rest of this junk...</i>
but I'm just gonna blow the place up
and sell the land.
I'm sure glad you didn't.
Do you mind if I take a look?
Mm-mmm.
So you say you're one of those kids
Sonny was lookin' for?
I don't know.
I was hoping there was something
that Mr. Herbert had here...
that would help me find my parents.
<i>You said there were some other men</i>
<i>that came looking for him?</i>
Just fore Mr. Herbert disappeared.
They claimed he owed them money.
Tell the truth, they looked like
vending machines with heads.
[Chuckles]
So I didn't ask too many questions.
Oh, there was a weird-looking one
with an oxygen tank.
- Oxygen tank?
- Yeah.
Spooky-looking guy.
Had deep-set eyes. You know him?
We've met.
Did they take anything?
They was in a pretty big hurry.
I never got a chance to tell 'em
about the stuff down in the basement.
The basement?
<i>A dozen boxes full of files and photos.</i>
<i>Mostly they're missing kids.</i>
- Is this all there is?
- That's it.
- It's not here.
- Nothin' about your parents?
- These files, they only go back 20 years.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not here.
I'm not here!
[Sighs, Panting]
I'm not here.
[Sighs]
I'm not... here.
- <i>[Thunderclap]</i>
- Get your mind off of your career
for one second, will you?
I'm talking about the children.
What's so troubling about children,
for God's sakes?
- Do you know how we got those children?
- I know what I need to know.
No, no. You know what
the Centre wants you to know.
<i>You</i>... <i>You always do this.</i>
You always push away what doesn't fit
into your pristine view of the world.
- All you want to do is poison
the good things in your life.
- Sydney!
<i>[Honking, Crashing]</i>
<i>[Knocking On Door]</i>
[Whispers]
Jacob.
[Simultaneously]
We have to talk.
I don't wanna ruin your fun, but how long
you plan on keepin' him in here?
I don't know.
I've grown sort of attached to him.
That's a sick man.
<i>I like it here.</i>
Peaceful. Quiet.
The building manager told me that you
worked for Sonny for the last 10 years.
Eleven.
[Chuckles]
He put an ad in a local paper
and misspelled a few words.
I took pity on him.
What you want with him anyway?
When I was a little boy...
I was... separated from my parents.
I believe they might have hired
Mr. Herbert to find me.
- You check all the files?
- They don't date back far enough.
I need to speak to Sonny personally.
- That's impossible.
- Why is that?
He's in a hospital.
Burns over 80% of his body.
Police say it was an accident.
Fell asleep smoking.
You don't sound convinced.
Sonny was an insomniac.
He'd never have fallen asleep so deep
that he'd set himself afire.
I tried to tell the police...
but there's no record of his problem...
so they let it go.
There's something else.
Sonny thought he was being followed.
After he got hurt, I got scared.
Where is he now?
V.A. Hospital, Slidell.
- After we spoke earlier...
- We both had the same...
- Thought about your...
- Accident.
Yes?
You said the accident was on...
- August 2...
- 1967?
- <i>The last time we saw</i>...
- Dr. Jacob...
Was on the Monday before.
<i>And you can both remember</i>
<i>a specific Monday...</i>
<i>30 years ago?</i>
- It was the day before our 10th...
- Birthday.
- And the first time we'd ever seen...
- [Both] A gun.
- <i>Dr. Jacob was shouting.</i>
- <i>[Sydney] At you?</i>
- Oh, no, but it was a very...
- Loud argument.
- <i>The other man said</i>...
- <i>"If you're not part of the solution'"</i>...
<i>"Then you're part of the problem. '"</i>
- <i>Then Dr. Jacob began</i>...
- <i>To argue back.</i>
And that's when...
He pressed the gun...
<i>into Dr. Jacob's neck.</i>
- <i>Dr. Billy.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>Dr. Billy.</i>
- <i>[Sydney] Billy?</i>
You mean Dr. William Raines.
<i>[Simultaneously]</i>
<i>Dr. Billy scared us to death.</i>
<i>[Knocking]</i>
[Grunts]
Son of a bitch!
[Grunts]
Now I'm going to forget
you just did that...
and it would be disrespectful
to kill you in front of family.
Where's Ben Worth's body?
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Is that why you're here?</i>
<i>I moved him.</i>
Just in case hotshot here
started mouthin' off...
and somebody went looking...
you'd be protected.
- Not that you'd do something like that.
- What about the woman?
- I saw you go to her house,
and you never came out.
- You've been a busy boy.
We all have quirks.
<i>Mine happens to be taking photos,</i>
<i>as you know.</i>
But even that gets boring,
so I decided to take some live ones.
Now what did I tell you
about pointing guns at me?
Put it up.
- She still alive?
- <i>For the time being.</i>
I'm going to do her in front of you.
<i>I know this little spot in the woods</i>
<i>not too far from here.</i>
Perfect place for a woman
who's been abandoned by her husband...
<i>to park her car, roll up the window...</i>
and gas herself.
Yeah. I knew you were
the right man for the job.
- Wait a minute.
- What?
Story on the limp is you took one
running from the cops in Chicago.
Doctors had to take
an inch of bone out. True?
- Yeah, it's true.
- Show me.
- What?
- <i>[Gun Cocks]</i>
Show me your knee.
<i>Is there anything else you'd like to see?</i>
Nah.
Let's go.
I gotta use the can.
<i>[Beaulieu]</i>
<i>Donny.!</i>
No.
We've bothered Mr. Doe
enough for one day.
I'm not gonna let you foul up
his hotel room on top of it.
<i>Now let's go.</i>
[Deep Sigh]
So, Jarod, is everything set?
Cops will think she killed herself...
depressed about
the disappearance of her husband...
and the failed business.
[Chuckles]
That's just fine.
Now about my money.
- Well, uh, got a little problem there.
- What kind of problem?
- This kind.
- Now you know why nothin'
ever lands on my doorstep.
- Do him.
- A pleasure.
Big mistake.
You never learn, do you?
Doris.
<i>[Ben]</i>
<i>Come here, baby. Come here.</i>
- Get in.
- How much you want?
How much does he want? You were gonna
kill my wife. Think you can buy your way out?
All right, Ben. That's enough.
He gets the point.
Yeah, right.
Get in, or die.
You too, squirrelly. Get in.
Well, I think it's time
for my last photo shoot.
Now, I'm gonna ask you two
some questions.
You answer correctly,
this'll be over soon.
Did you hire an assassin...
to kill Ben and Doris Worth?
<i>I saw your leg.!</i>
<i>I seen that scar on there.!</i>
It's neat, huh?
A little mortician's wax,
a little pancake makeup, and voilŕ.
Now, did you contract
for the killing of Ben and Doris Worth?
I'm afraid that's not
gonna do you any good.
And I wouldn't try
smashing the window.
Shatterproof glass.
<i>Well, looks to me like you boys aren't</i>
<i>interested in doing too much talking, so</i>...
[Both Coughing]
<i>The exhaust.!</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Hey, good luck to the both of you.</i>
<i>Okay, he hired you to kill 'em,</i>
<i>to kill all of'em.!</i>
- Donny!
- I could tell you where he buried the bodies!
- I can't hear you.
- All right, Jarod. I did it.
All right, Jarod,
I'll give you $100,000 to open this door!
My, that's an awful lot of money.
A man would be crazy
not to think that offer over.
<i>[Coughing Continues]</i>
I thought it over.
No deal.
Jarod!
- <i>[Coughing]</i>
- You're just gonna let 'em die?
I only put enough gas in the tank
to scare them.
<i>The engine should shut off</i>
<i>in about 30 seconds.</i>
I wish I could stick around to see how
they try to explain that tape to the police.
They should be here any minute.
Hey, who could I say? Thanks, pal.
Thank you.
You two, you work well together.
You should consider a merger.
- See?
- Oh, please, don't start.
I miss you, Jacob.
<i>And I've missed you too, Sydney.</i>
Why has it taken you so long
to talk to me?
I was afraid.
I thought that, um...
if I tried and failed...
you'd be gone forever.
Jacob... that night in the car...
I've already told you, Sydney.
It wasn't your fault.
But you see, I wasn't listening...
to what you were really trying
to say to me.
You were in trouble.
You needed my help.
I was...
ashamed.
I couldn't tell you what I'd done...
the things...
<i>Jacob, did Raines</i>
<i>have anything to do...</i>
with what happened to you, to us?
You know the answer to that, Sydney.
- <i>[Knocking, Door Opens]</i>
- <i>[Miss Parker] Sydney.</i>
You ready to go?
Don't say a word.
- <i>[Machinery Hissing]</i>
- <i>[Monitor Beeping]</i>
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>You can try to speak to Mr. Herbert...</i>
<i>but since the accident,</i>
<i>he drifts in and out of consciousness.</i>
Mr. Herbert.
- <i>Mr. Herbert.</i>
- [Quiet Moan]
Sonny.
- [Grunts]
- <i>My name is Jarod.</i>
Mr. Herbert, 30 years ago...
my parents may have hired you
to find me.
You were a private investigator.
You used to help find lost children.
Ch-Children.
Mr. Herbert. M-M-Mr. Herbert.
Do you recognize this woman?
- This is my mother.
- Oh.
Do you remember her name?
Nice... woman.
Wanted to find... her little boy.
Yes. That's right.
Do you remember her name?
Mr. Herbert. Mr. Herbert,
do you remember her name?
[Sighs]
[Sighs]
Remember her name.
[Rings]
- Hello.
- [Jarod] Hello, Sydney.
Jarod.
I wanted to thank you
for sending me the photograph.
What photograph, Jarod?
Sonny Herbert.
Jarod, I did not send you any photos.
In fact, I was just about to thank you...
for the message letting me know
about the Twins Convention.
Sydney...
I didn't send you any message.
Then who did?
[Mews]
- <i>Previously on</i> The Pretender.
- Yes, Mr. Parker.
<i>Angelo is searching the Internet</i>
<i>for any signs ofJarod now.</i>
SL-27.
What does it mean, Jacob?
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>SL 27. What does it mean?</i>
[Tires Screeching]
- Does he have a name?
- They're calling him Jarod.
- He misses his parents.
- He'll forget them soon enough.

This is Parker.
We're in pursuit of a blue sedan.
<i>[Thumping]</i>

<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
- [Knocking]
- Christine!
<i>Christine?</i>
- Jarod?
- I'm sorry, Christine.
- I know it's late.
- It's 3:00 in the morning. God isn't even awake.
I know. Listen, I need
to move back in for a little while.
Not smellin' like that you're not.
- Please.
- Look, Jarod...
I owe you big time for what you did for me,
but my husband's comin' back tomorrow.
- If Axe finds a man livin' upstairs,
he'll have a stroke.
- <i>[Soft Cry]</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
Where did you get it?
A man threw him in the Dumpster.
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
How could someone do that?
How could someone
throw away a baby?
It's a crazy world.
Babies havin' babies...
people don't know what they want
or what they have.
It's freezing in here.
You have to call the police.
I'm the only family
he has right now.
He's cold, he's scared,
and he's alone.
Don't you like babies?
Of course.
It's just that if Axe
didn't get the job in Houston...
<i>he'll have a stroke ifhe comes back</i>
<i>and finds a baby here.</i>
- He doesn't like babies?
- No.
Yes.
That's not the point.
- He's hungry.
- How can you tell?
Because I'm hungry.
Wanna... Wanna lay down?
There you go.
There you go.
Why-Why would Jarod risk getting caught
over a random set of blueprints?
[Chuckles] WhereJarod's concerned,
there's never anything random.
Hmm.
Boy Genius is a regular I.M. Pei.
Wait.
What's this? SL 27?
I'll be around.

<i>Who taught you that song?</i>
I don't know.
My mother, I think.
You think?
When I was little,
I was taken from my family.
<i>I was raised by some people</i>...
people that had no business
dealing with children.
I'm sorry.
Look, Jarod, I appreciate
everything you did for me.
<i>That phony lawsuit that lady filed</i>
<i>against the shop would have busted me...</i>
- if you hadn't stepped in, but, still, I can't let you...
- <i>[Jarod, Babytalk]</i>
<i>[Baby Cries Out]</i>
- Holler downstairs if you need any help, okay?
- Christine?
Thanks.
- [Man] Does he have a name?
- [Man #2] They're calling him Jarod.
- He misses his parents.
- He'll forget them soon enough.
[Tones Beeping]
- [Ringing]
- This is Sydney.
- How could somebody abandon a child?
- Jarod.
I mean, something so vulnerable...
so defenseless.
- How could they do that?
- Is this about your parents?
- It's about all parents.
- [Sydney Sighs]
Well, there's no easy answer to that.
Who knows what, uh...
what pressures some people face.
Is this what you were looking for
earlier at that architectural firm?
Those blueprints?
Is that a lead to your parents?
You'll figure it out.
Hey.
[Clears Throat]
It's, uh, for my little girl.
She's very fortunate to have
such an attentive father.
I, uh, did the search you requested.
Found two inactive
license plates with "SL 27,"
but both owners died in the '70s.
SL 27 is also the generic name
for an antibiotic...
developed by an Israeli
pharmaceutical company in 1983.
That's beyond
the date of significance.
Well...
if you told me more, Sydney,
I might be able to help.
Broots, it's best that...
nobody else be involved in this.
<i>Broots, anything on SL 27 yet?</i>
Uh...
Perhaps you both should have a talk.
<i>[Keyboard Clacking]</i>
<i>[Knocking]</i>
- Shh.
- <i>Still sleepin'?</i>
<i>Like a baby.</i>
- What are you doin'?
- Setting it up.
If anybody files a missing persons report
with the police department, I'll get a signal.
Jarod, you can't keep this child.
<i>Last night is one thing,</i>
<i>but somewhere...</i>
somebody's looking for this baby.
I've been monitoring every police channel,
every television station, every newspaper.
- <i>Nobody's looking for him.</i>
- But, Jarod...
Somebody threw him
in a Dumpster.
Do you want me to turn him over
to that person?
If his mother's out there searching,
I'll find her.
<i>But I'm not gonna</i>
<i>give him to anybody...</i>
<i>till I know he's gonna be okay.</i>
I don't want him
to grow up alone.
- <i>[Baby Crying]</i>
- Are you hungry again?
- That's not a bottle cry.
- How do you know?
Seven younger brothers and sisters.
Better change him.
<i>[Crying Continues]</i>
I killed the security cameras,
and I swept the room for bugs.
- I think we're safe.
- You think?
One never knows
in the Centre, do one?
Let's proceed.
This belonged to one of the children
my mother rescued from the Centre.
Look at this.
"SL 27."
Why did you keep
this information secret?
Why, I could ask
the same question of you.
When my brother regained consciousness,
he wrote this to me.
Hmm.
There has to be a clue in
the calculations thatJarod dropped.
Broots, keep on searching
for that connection.
Look, I don't know if
you guys missed it, but, uh...
the only people who know about this
SL 27 thing are either dead or comatose.
And those people
are important to us...
like your daughter is to you.
I'm asking for your help, Broots...
as a friend.
Please.
<i>[Buzzing]</i>
What is he doing?
- He appears to be expressing his individualism.
- Is that good?
<i>[Raines]</i>
<i>It's dangerous.</i>
Angelo, I want you to run a check...
on every aspect of Centre security.
Every system, every level,
every mode of access and egress.
Optical, physical, electronic.
[Wheezing]
Everything.
<i>Do you understand?</i>
Angelo?
[Buzzer Clicks Off]
<i>[Chatter, Baby Crying]</i>
- <i>Excuse me, ma'am.</i>
- I'll be right with you.
<i>Yes, I'm looking at the file. We've placed</i>
<i>a call to the biological grandparents...</i>
but the status is still unclear.
- Sure. Can I help you?
- We'd like to talk to somebody
about a missin' child.
I'll be one more minute.
No, it's against the law...
<i>to prematurely place a child without the</i>
<i>signature of a biological family member.</i>
I realize you love the baby,
but this is the way it has to be handled.
I know this is hard, Jarod,
but I think it's the best thing...
Jarod?
Are you insane?
You can't just walk out with this baby.
- Well, I can't leave him with them.
- Jarod, he doesn't belong to you.
[Sighs]
I know.
He belongs with his parents...
or with someone who loves him.
Twenty-four hours. Then we take
the baby to the police no matter what.
Deal?
Deal.
One more thing.
Give him a name, will ya?
He has a name.
I just have to
find out what it is.
- What is it?
- They all have red decals.
The man who dumped this baby had
the exact same decal on the back of his car.
<i>What are you sayin'?</i>
A cop threw this baby away.
- Talk to me, Broots.
- You'll never guess what I found out.
The architectural firm
you chased Jarod from was...
The same one that built the Centre.
- How did you know that?
- [Ringing]
- This is Sydney.
- [Jarod] Any luck?
- With what?
- <i>Well, hello, Miss Parker.</i>
SL 27.
Those calculations, Jarod...
what do they mean?
Just digging up some more dirt
on the Centre.
- I don't follow.
- <i>Do the math, Sydney.</i>
It doesn't add up.
<i>I'm surprised that Broots</i>
<i>hasn't figured it out yet.</i>
- Dirt.
- <i>I gotta go.</i>
<i>It's the baby's nap time.</i>
Did he say baby?
<i>I'll be damned.</i>
6.32 million cubic feet of dirt...
was carted off for the Centre's
underground construction.
<i>But the Centre's</i>
<i>26 sublevels only occupy...</i>
6.16 million cubic feet.
There's enough missing dirt
for another sublevel.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>SL 27.</i>
Sublevel 27.
This is my mother.
We're going to find yours.
- I promise.
- <i>[Christine] Well, that's a sight.</i>
- You and Axe ever think about having kids?
- <i>Axe?</i>
No. No way.
Besides, I got the shop to worry about.
Any luck with that license plate?
Not yet. I have to get inside
the police department...
and find out who was driving that car,
but I'm going to need your help.
Jarod, I've got customers.
I can't go chasin'...
<i>Christine?</i>
<i>Somebody took my spot.</i>
- <i>Axe.!</i>
- Your husband's gone two weeks,
and all you can say is "Axe"?
- How'd it go?
- <i>Ah, came up empty.</i>
Who are you?
Hi. I'm Jarod.
- Who's this?
- Um, I can explain. Uh...
<i>Would you look at them eyes?</i>
<i>Do you mind?</i>
<i>No, not at all.</i>
[Chuckling]
That's a fine-looking boy.
It-It is a boy?
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Hey, hey.
- <i>Hey, hey.</i>
- You like kids?
Like 'em?
I'd have a whole tribe
if Christy would cooperate.
<i>You ever need a babysitter,</i>
<i>I'm your man.</i>
I'll remember that.
Better move the truck.
<i>[Woman Over Scanner, Indistinct]</i>
- Anything come over the scanner?
- <i>Not yet.</i>
Why did you lie about Axe?
I grew up with
seven brothers and sisters.
I was the oldest,
and my mother was...
Well, she wasn't what
you'd call "hands on."
What about your father?
He was busy with
his other family across town.
It was up to me to make sure
Ari and William were fed...
and Matty was dressed...
and Jeremy didn't stay up late,
and Ella did her homework.
I got out of Little Rock
and moved in with Axe.
I want to be able to think
about Christine for a while.
Does that make me a bad person?
No. It makes you human.
- <i>[Man] See you later, Frank.</i>
- <i>[Woman Over Loudspeaker]</i>
<i>Bill, pick up line two.</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>We better put it up on the lift.</i>
<i>[Woman Over Loudspeaker]</i>
<i>Chuck, come to the parts desk.</i>
Hey, sport...
take a look at this unit?
No problem.
<i>Accidentally clipped a junkie</i>
<i>who decided not to cooperate.</i>
<i>Guess he'll cooperate next time.</i>
Get this unit fixed.
I wanna get out of here fast.
<i>Whatever you say, uh, Detective</i>...
Geary, David W.
Those look straight to you?
- Yeah.
- I'll be back.
[No Audible Dialogue]
<i>[Broots] Okay, it's right</i>
<i>around here somewhere.</i>
- What is?
- Sewer access.
Broots, the sewer main is on
the other side of the complex.
I know.
Which makes me wonder why
there's a manhole cover right here.
Help me, Sydney.
- <i>[Air Hissing]</i>
- Oh!
- [Sydney] Can you smell that?
- Smell it? I can taste it.
<i>[Air Hissing]</i>
After you.
How-How do you know
it's not wired down there?
<i>I ran Centre security for three years.</i>
<i>I know what I'm doing.</i>
Yeah, well, you didn't know
about SL 27.
Get in.
You know...
I'm not sure my medical insurance
covers this sort of thing.
Sydney, put some light on me.
Ow!
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>What died down here?</i>
What didn't?
Let's go.
Okay.

- <i>[Axe Chuckles]</i>

<i>Me and my old man</i>
<i>used to watch hoops on the tube.</i>

me and my kid would do the same.
Christine told me what's going on.
<i>You really think that cop's involved?</i>
<i>His name is David Geary. He's a special</i>
<i>investigator for D.A. Mitch Meyers.</i>
- Ugh, bureaucrats.
- Sounds like you're not a big fan of city hall.
<i>I spent 20 years</i>
<i>drivin'a garbage rig for the city.</i>

- Wow.
- <i>You know, Jarod...</i>
I seen a lot of dirty things
on the street.
But why anyone would want to hurt
something as wonderful as this...
is beyond me.
<i>Yeah.</i>
- [Beeps]
- What's that?

Yes. There was a rumor
of a fire in the summer of'82.

What is it?
<i>This place has all the components</i>
<i>of a sim lab.</i>
<i>[Broots] I never knew</i>
<i>there was another sim lab in the Centre.</i>
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Neither did I.</i>
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>What the hell is that?</i>
Birthing table.
- With shackles?
- <i>[Pager Beeping]</i>
Uh-oh.
- It's Mr. Raines.
- What are you waiting for?
- <i>Miss Parker.</i>
- What is this place?
Whatever it was,
it wasn't a filing room.
<i>These haven't been burnt.</i>
<i>These were brought here.</i>
All these files pertain
to the Pretender project.
This box is all aboutJarod.
What is that?
A hood.
Must've been Jarod's.
Sydney, there is no date of death...
listed forJarod's parents.
As far as these documents are concerned,
they were alive when Jarod was brought here.
Jarod was stolen.
I think you should
look at this entrance record.
- There's no names, nothing to follow.
- Hmm.
But there is a signature by a special expediter
who broughtJarod to the Centre.
Special expediter...
Jacob.
That signature is my brother...
Jacob.
<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
What?
Raines has Angelo sanitizing
the security system.
- Does he know where we are?
- No, I don't think so.
- You don't think?
- Yes. No! I don't know!
It was weird. Raines was real suspicious,
and Angelo just kept giggling.
And, man, you're not gonna
believe his head.
Just keep yours cool.
- <i>It's Raines.</i>
- He knows.
Just grab the files.
These files have been
collected by someone.
- Removing them will arouse suspicion.
- This may be our only chance.
I want to find out the truth
as much as you do.
<i>But at this point,</i>
<i>caution is key.</i>
Detective Dave Geary.
You've got thatJane Doe.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Still checking, Detective.</i>
Suicide attempt.
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>It's just not coming up.</i>
Oh, here it is.
Room 708.
Jeanette.
Jeanette, wake up.
Please, no more.
I don't need any more sedatives.
- <i>I'm not crazy.</i>
- I know.
Oh, no, no.
I didn't try to kill myself.
There was a man, and he threw me
off the bridge. It was a policeman.
Why won't anyone believe me?
- I believe you.
- Well, who are you?
My name is Jarod.
I'm here to help you.
- He took my baby.
- I have your baby.
- He's with me.
- Where's Michael?
He is safe, but we must
get out of this hospital.
The man who tried to kill you is here.
<i>[Woman Over P.A.] Dr. Peterson,</i>
<i>call your service. Dr. Peterson, call your service.</i>
[Chatter, Indistinct]
- <i>[Engine Starting]</i>
- <i>[Tires Screeching]</i>
I was so afraid
I would never see him again.
Where'd you find him?
That's not important.
What's important is
you're together now.
<i>Jeanette...</i>
why would a police detective
want you and Michael dead?
- <i>Was it because of Mitch Meyers?</i>
- Yeah.
Is Michael Mitch's son?
I was working as an intern
in his office.
I thought he was good.
I thought he meant the things that he said.
We had an affair.
He said he didn't love his wife anymore,
and he was gonna leave her.
I mean, I could barely
pay for my rent...
so I told him he had to take
responsibility for his son.
And?
He said he would do the right thing,
and l-I believed him.
I mean, I didn't think...
It's okay.
Detective Geary came,
and he told me...
<i>that Mitch wanted to see me</i>
<i>because he wanted to help us.</i>
And l... I didn't think.
We just got in the car,
and the next thing I knew...
I'm being dragged out on the bridge,
and all I could hear was my Michael crying.
I oughta break
the bastard's neck.
- Now can we go to the police?
- <i>[Jarod] No.</i>
We have to play a little politics
with the D.A. first.
I wanna help.
For Michael.
Isn't tomorrow garbage day?
Mitch Meyers, please.
It's urgent.
[Meyers]
Jeanette, listen to me.
- <i>When he was born</i>...
- <i>[Jeanette] His name is Michael.</i>
<i>Right. When Michael was born,</i>
<i>I thought I could finally make the break.</i>
<i>Then I started thinking how it might look</i>...
<i>my wife, my children, you being so young.</i>
Everything I have worked for... all the good
I have done... it would be going down the drain.
- <i>So you tried to kill us?</i>
- <i>No, that's not what I wanted.</i>
<i>That's not who I am.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>
Look, if you don't want the truth
played out on the 11:00 news...
you have Detective Geary bring $50,000
to the alley where he left Michael at 2:00.
<i>[Truck Approaching]</i>
Police officer. You're gonna have
to take this trash another time.
<i>We collect it now.</i>
You guys don't know
what you're doin'.
You feeling naked?
A little vulnerable?
It's terrifying, isn't it?
Being at someone else's mercy...
<i>completely defenseless...</i>
like a little baby...
tossed in a Dumpster
in the middle of the night.
You threw away an innocent baby.
- <i>[Click]</i>
- <i>I've been waiting for this moment</i>
<i>ever since I saw you...</i>
standing in the alley.
As district attorney,
I have worked hard for this city...
<i>to repair the faith,</i>
<i>the belief and the leadership...</i>
<i>of your elected officials.</i>
Excuse me. Mrs. Meyers?
Hi.
- <i>My name is Jeanette Connelly.</i>
...family values, responsibilities...
Your husband and I
have been having an affair.
I am a man who
believes in commitment.
<i>Jan</i>...<i>my wife of 15 years</i>...
my two beautiful daughters...
Jessica and Lindsay.
<i>I know what it takes</i>
<i>to build a successful family.</i>
<i>It takes honesty.</i>
<i>[Jeanette Over Speaker]</i>
<i>You tried to kill me and our son.</i>
<i>[Meyers Over Speaker]</i>
<i>Jeanette, listen to me.</i>
I was frightened of
what you might do, might say.
Everything I have worked for... all the good
I have done... it would be going down the drain.
- <i>So you tried to kill us?</i>
- <i>No, that's not what I wanted.</i>
<i>That's not who I am.</i>
I told Geary to frighten you.
That's all.
<i>I didn't know he was gonna take it</i>
<i>as far as murder. You have to believe me.</i>
[Groans]
Oh! I almost forgot.
<i>Now they're straight.</i>
<i>[Michael Crying]</i>
- Thanks, Axe.
- Bye-bye toJarod.
- Hey. Come here.
- Bye, Jarod.
Thanks, Christine.
Hey, little man,
it was very nice to meet you.
I want you to do me a favor.
I want you to always
listen to your mom.
Never, ever forget her.
Okay?
There's my boy.
Hi! How're you doin'?
- Thank you.
- Good luck.
Thank you.
- Say bye-bye, sweetie.
- Bye.
Bye.
<i>[Sydney] Broots has circumvented</i>
<i>the security sensors.</i>
<i>We have 10 minutes.</i>
<i>Let's just take a closer look at those files</i>
<i>and get the hell out ofhere.</i>
It's all gone.
Raines.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>No. If Raines knew we found those files...</i>
we'd be dead.
Well, if he didn't
take them, who did?
[Mews]
- <i>Previously on</i> The Pretender.
- Who am I?
Was I bought? Stolen?
Where are my mom and dad?
- This is my mother.
- <i>[Sydney] Yes, it is.</i>
<i>His name is Angelo.</i>
<i>Someone who can absorb the intellectual,</i>
<i>emotional, even the physical traits of others...</i>
<i>and literally becomes that person.</i>
- I want to know what happened to my mother.
- I killed her.
That's what I torture myself believing.
<i>Raines is a dangerous man. He may be involved</i>
<i>with the murder of Miss Parker's mother.</i>
- <i>I fantasize about killing him.</i>
- <i>The only people who know about SL 27...</i>
are either dead or comatose.
<i>SL 27. Sublevel 27.</i>
- <i>What the hell is that?</i>
- Birthing table.
With shackles?
<i>[Gate Buzzes]</i>
<i>[Chatter, Indistinct]</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>You got my radio or what?</i>
<i>You know the drill.</i>
- Better tighten them shackles.
- Houdini couldn't get out of these.
- Tighten 'em.
- Why? This convict's not playing with a full deck?
Deck and a half, brother.
All wild cards.
Bit a guard's nose off once.
Said he didn't like the way...
- the guard used it to look down on him.
- [Scoffs]
<i>A little reeducation will change his diet.</i>
<i>Signed, sealed</i>
<i>and soon to be delivered.</i>
- [Coughing]
- Hey, hey.
Like I said. Wild cards.
[Grunting]
That's a taste of
your future. Come on.
Now, remember,
always irrigate your gums.
- I aqua-flush every night.
- Good. What about your brother?
He doesn't even floss.
Ike, can I have my sucker, please?
Thank you. We try with him, Dr. Jarod,
but I guess Ike will always be a Goofus.
- A Goofus?
- And Gallant. It's all in here.
"Goofus leaves his room a mess.
Gallant makes his bed every day."
<i>A morality lesson in a children's comic book.</i>
<i>Fascinating.</i>
- [Burps]
- I'll have to read these.
<i>[Woman On TV]</i>
<i>The convicts took control of the transport van.</i>
Moments ago, I spoke with the prison guards
lucky to have survived.
All of a sudden, he was in the cab.
Thought he was gonna kill us right there.
- Cool.
- <i>He kept smiling at us...</i>
<i>like he was having fun</i>
<i>messing with our minds.</i>
He locked us in the back of
the van, drove into the pond.
Only an inch of air to breathe.
I thought I was gonna die.
The F.B.I. Task Force, led by
Special Agent Korkos...
is on the trail of this criminal,
known only as John Doe.
<i>The escapee is 6'1", 175 pounds...</i>
and has a distinctive burn mark
on his right hand.
<i>We'll have more on this breaking story as</i>
<i>information becomes available.</i>
- Cool.
- He's incorrigible, Dr. Jarod.
Dr. Jarod?
- You have to talk.
- No.
Why? The anticipation of pain is clearly
more effective than the pain itself.
- He's almost at the brink.
- [Young Raines] Don't argue with me, just do it.
- But...
- Just do it.
- Ow! You burnt my hand!
- It was real, Sydney.
- You bastard!
- Sweepers.
Get to the infirmary now.
Kyle, I'm sorry!
I would never hurt you.
Kyle, I would never hurt you.
I would never hurt you. Kyle.
Never hurt you.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
In all the time that he's been here,
did you interact with him?
Oh, yeah, we interacted,
but it wasn't always him.
He always thought he was somebody
different every time you see him.
Could talk with a doctor,
astronaut, anything.
Yeah, so what do you criminal
psychologists call that anyway?
- Multiple personalities?
- Something like that.
Weird too, man. I mean,
this guy spends 10 years in stir...
and nobody could figure out
who he was, where he come from.
- Is that why you called him "John Doe"?
- Yeah.
<i>I actually believe this guy</i>
<i>didn't know who he was either.</i>
He used to tell me there was voices speaking
to him in his head all the time.
In this guy's case,
them voices were really there.
<i>And when those voices told him he was</i>
<i>somebody different, he made you believe it too.</i>
Really?
I remember one time
I played along with him.
<i>He told me he was</i>
<i>an I.R.S. investigator.</i>
<i>So I let him do my taxes.</i>
<i>The guy got me a $4,000 refund.</i>
Hey. I always wondered
where he kept that thing.
He used to sit there, scribbling in that thing
like a madman every time his doctor left.
- <i>What's it say?</i>
- <i>That he's dangerous.</i>
What was his doctor's name?
I called him "Dr. Wheezy."
Not polite I know,
but hey, the guy, he breathed funny.
I guess anybody would, dragging around
his own oxygen tank though, huh?
<i>[Buzzing]</i>
[Sydney] We're giving Angelo
every red notebookJarod ever made.
<i>[Miss Parker] Now tell me again:</i>
<i>Exactly what's Buzz Boy going to do with them?</i>
<i>[Broots] The theory is that since Angelo can</i>
<i>absorb all the personality data given to him...</i>
maybe, just maybe, he might be able to
determine whereJarod is...
emotionally and physically.
Well, then, let's see
what the potato head can do.
Okay.
Put it down, Angelo.
Put him back in his space.
I have authorization to use him.
No one below me
can authorize his use.
My father isn't below you.
This better work.
Well, I know if it doesn't,
my butt's on the line.
Mmm, wrong piece of anatomy.
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>
Hello. This is Harriet.
Somebody open a window.
It stinks in here.
Do we have point of origin
on that phone call yet?
<i>A friend called to warn Harriet Tashman</i>
<i>about the escaped John Doe.</i>
<i>They traced the call at local headquarters</i>
<i>when I got there.</i>
Special AgentJarod Ness.
I was sent by Washington.
- Ness?
- No relation.
[Chuckles] Well, welcome aboard.
We need all the help we can get on this one.
<i>The escapee is a John Doe.</i>
In the 10 years since his arrest,
we couldn't find anything about him.
No priors. No fingerprint
matches, D.N.A., nothing.
Like he fell from the sky. He was convicted
of a string of violent felonies...
on a cross-country binge that ended in
the kidnapping of one Harriet Tashman...
whose spilled soup
you happen to be standing in.
All of those victims
shared one common denominator.
They were all terrified. This sick puppy
relishes psychological torture.
Doe stalked Miss Tashman for two days
before he grabbed her at gunpoint...
and forced her to drive him away.
Miss Tashman had the presence of mind
to crash the car into an embankment...
injuring herself and John Doe, but thereby
escaping whatever fate he had in store for her.
- <i>That was 10 years ago.</i>
- And you think he's after her again?
<i>It's speculation on my part,</i>
<i>but all of those actions...</i>
<i>prior to her kidnap were random.</i>
<i>He came here for her, and, clearly,</i>
<i>he was taking her somewhere.</i>
Are we sure he was after her? He was before,
and by the look of how quickly she left...
- he must be again.
- Aren't you guys done yet?
- Who are you?
- Jenkins. I'm the manager of this place.
<i>Ness, take Mr. Jenkins's statement.</i>
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>I gave a statement to the first guy.</i>
- The first guy?
- The F.B.I. agent who was here this morning.
<i>[Dog Barking In Distance]</i>
- Yeah, yeah. Where to?
- Perfect day like this, I'll tell you when to stop.
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey.</i>
<i>No smoking.</i>
You mean me?
<i>No. I mean the invisible guy</i>
<i>next to you. Yeah, you. Put it out.</i>
- But I just lit it.
- <i>I don't care if you invented it.</i>
Put it out.
Whatever you say.
<i>[Sydney] Calm down, Miss Parker.</i>
<i>You've got to have patience.</i>
<i>Patience? Don't talk to me</i>
<i>about patience.</i>
What I need is a cattle prod.
Maybe that'll jump-start the little lab rat.
<i>He hasn't blinked, smiled,</i>
<i>moved, nothing.</i>
<i>Angelo is absorbing his way through</i>
<i>the notebooks chronologically.</i>
<i>Right now, he's in the mid-'70s.</i>
<i>I believe I saw him squint around 1969.</i>
<i>[Broots] After looking at the notebook on</i>
<i>Marilyn Monroe, I think he giggled.</i>
I should never have put myself
on the line for you two.
<i>This is a waste of time, Syd.</i>
<i>[Angelo Growling]</i>
<i>[Miss Parker Choking]</i>
- <i>Angelo, no.</i>
- Sam, help!
Let go of her, Angelo.
Angelo, let go.
<i>Sweepers, help.!</i>
<i>Angelo, let go.!</i>
- Miss Parker, you okay?
- [Panting]
- You okay?
- What the hell was that?
A violent reaction to
whatever was in the red notebook.
It's not red.
<i>The notebook he was</i>
<i>absorbing, it's blue.</i>
<i>[Phones Ringing]</i>
<i>[Woman] Residents were stunned by</i>
<i>the attack on Harriet Tashman, a former nun.</i>
Tashman's injuries were minor...
and sources report that she
does not want to press charges.
At the moment, a spokesperson
for the police is telling us...
that they are considering
this case closed.
Oh, my God.
<i>[Drawer Opens, Closes]</i>
Mom.
He scared me.
I'm glad he didn't hurt you.
Angelo has always been a mystery.
Something on your mind?
Mr. Raines was upset that
I gave you access to Angelo.
Boohoo for Dracula.
Angelo is his project.
Apparently, Raines has been worried
about him becoming violent.
- The guy is a marshmallow.
- <i>Still, he attacked you.</i>
- That justifies Raines's fear and concern for you.
- <i>Concern?</i>
Daddy, you may not want to hear this,
but I think he's working behind your back.
He would not defy me.
I'm sorry. Daddy,
I know that that tone is inappropriate.
No, no, no. You may be right.
I've never doubted Raines's dedication,
but he's been different.
Ever sinceJarod's been out,
I've wondered if there was something.
Trust me, Daddy. There is.
Do you have anything tangible?
No.
If you should find something
real, something I could trust...
I'll bring it
to your attention immediately.
My grandpa was
the caretaker here before me.
Miss Harriet, she's the woman
who owns this place...
gave me the job after Grandpa died.
She sends me money in the mail
to keep it looking pretty for her.
Funny, huh?
- Funny?
- Well, that she wants it kept looking so pretty.
She ain't been here
in 10 years or more.
Do you know where she is?
How to reach her?
No. I haven't talked
with her or anything.
Sometimes... Sometimes I wonder if
it's really her that sends the money.
Have you ever seen
this woman before?
- I have to go.
- Joe Bill, please.
This is my mother.
I don't know where she is.
Never knew my mama.
All there ever was
was me and Grandpa.
He says we're not
supposed to talk about them.
That they don't live here.
- They lived here?
- Over the barn.
Almost never came out.
Always alone.
She had red hair...
and he made planes out of wood.
Always planes.
When I was little, Miss Harriet,
she taught me how to read good... gooder.
These people always seemed like...
that book about the little girl
who lived in the attic.
Her name was Anne.
Anne Frank?
- The family that was hiding from the Nazis.
- Hiding.
Hiding.
<i>They left right after</i>
<i>Miss Harriet got took.</i>
Maybe it's them
that sends the money, huh?
Joe Bill, do you know
where they went?
Just went. They left some stuff.
<i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>
- Yes.
- This is Agent Meadow. We got a lead on Doe.
Korkos wants everyone
here now. Ness. Ness?
- I'm on my way.
- <i>[Phone Beeps Off]</i>
- I'll be back.
- Cabbie's in County General psych ward.
No injuries, but massive shock.
- Doc says he was literally scared nearly to death.
- What happened?
He was tied into his seat.
Mouth taped shut. Eyes taped open.
- Like he wanted him to watch something.
- His fate.
Doe parked his cab on top
of some railroad tracks facing a tunnel.
<i>Did the cabbie give us any leads?</i>
It's hard to talk after some psycho's
put his cigarette out on your tongue.
But he did say something about Doe
repeating, "I decide who lives or dies."
All the more reason for us to find him
before he finds Harriet Tashman...
if he hasn't already.
<i>This blue notebook</i>
<i>belonged to another subject.</i>
His name's Kyle, and he was part of
the Pretender program here years ago...
under the direction of then Dr. Raines.
I guess it only makes sense that you'd have
more than one freak in your farm system.
What makes Kyle so special?
The fact that he was
officially released from the center...
before the date
on the blue notebook.
Are you saying that Raines kept Kyle for
his own project? Where?
SL 27.
I rerouted the security system...
so if anyone has this place monitored,
it should be all right for about 30 minutes.
Look, since we don't have
much time...
why don't you keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open.
Fine with me. I don't wanna be
down here in the first place.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Over here.</i>
My God.
Somebody was forced to live here.
And from the look of
these striations...
he spent a great deal of time trying to
claw his way out of here.
<i>Sydney. Miss Parker.</i>
- <i>[Sydney] Broots, where are you?</i>
- <i>Down here. Down the hall.</i>
- What is it?
- It's a Brainchild.
One of the first generation
of super computers.
Raines's Brainchild. This is what he used
to record his work down here.
<i>I had a computer like this</i>
<i>in my early years with Jarod.</i>
And this was what
we stored his sims on...
before transferring them to D.S.A.
<i>Pretty useless now.</i>
Unless... those analogs
were backed up.
- In there? How?
- Some of these systems had
primitive hard-drive memories.
- [Laughs] Computer club in college.
- [Forced Chuckle]
Do whatever it is you have to do.
If it's in there, I want it out.
- Call me when you have it.
- Whoa, whoa. Whoa.
- You want me to stay down here? Alone?
- You still have 20 minutes.
Come on, Sydney.
Hi, Kyle. It's me, Jarod.
Remember?
- [Kyle] We're not supposed to talk.
- Where are you from?
- I don't know.
- Me neither.
I only remember here.
Do you know who you are?
- [Rewinds]
- Do you know who you are?
Who you are?
Who you are?
- <i>[Miss Parker] What did you find?</i>
- <i>Ten million bits of information.</i>
<i>A lot of it's about Kyle.</i>
<i>My machines are sorting it out now...</i>
but I did manage to transfer one sim
onto a D.S.A. format.
- What's on it?
- It's hot. I'm tired.
I've been in Memphis
for three days. Can't sleep.
There's too many people
outside this motel.
I'm getting ready.
I'm gonna make history.
I'm gonna close a bleeding wound.
You don't think
Dr. King is a good man.
No. He's dividing our country.
We had laws, and we had order.
King doesn't obey,
and Americans, they're afraid.
[Young Raines]
Maybe it's you who's afraid.
No. He's the menace. Kennedy gave in
to him, and Hoover can't stop him.
<i>It ends now. He has to die.</i>
<i>[Young Raines] Now who are you</i>
<i>to make thatjudgment?</i>
I decide who lives or dies.
I decide who lives or dies.
- My God! He did it.
- Did what?
Raines. He always wanted to do this
experiment with one of the Pretenders.
He thought that if he could feed him
enough negative reinforcement...
<i>he could strip them of their morality.</i>
And he could, uh, create a sociopath.
I decide who lives or dies.
I decide who lives or dies.
You're all set there.
Welcome to the Bay State.
- <i>[Alarm Beeping]</i>
- [Young Sydney]
Your ship was spying in our waters.
We demand you sign
the admission of aggression.
- We'd rather die.
- What about you, Lieutenant?
Well...
- maybeJarod's right.
- [Young Raines] Damn it! That's it.
- [Young Sydney] What are you doing?
- I never should've allowed it.
- We're aborting.
- Dr. Raines. Dr. Raines.
A Flying Cross.
Did they give this to you?
No. I've just always had it.
- Dr. Raines let you keep it?
- Dr. Raines is my friend.
It's origami. I'll teach you
how to make it sometime.
- Where do they keep you?
- They take me down an elevator.
I'm not sure where,
but there's sounds in the ceiling.
From the air vents.
I hear those sounds too.
We must be close to each other.
The speaker they use to talk to us,
is there a wire leading from it?
Yeah. Why?
I think I know how we can talk...
without them hearing us.
[Elevator Dings]
[Elevator Stops]
What did you do with Kyle?
Don't commit political suicide
over ancient history.
You ignored a Tower directive when you kept
Kyle here after his release date.
[Elevator Starts]
If I were you,
I'd stop dwelling on the past.
Jarod is your only lifeline
in this place...
and the longer he's out there...
the weaker your influence
on him becomes.
<i>[Elevator Dings]</i>
On my grave, Raines,
if Kyle is alive, I'll find him.
That son of a bitch could be anywhere.
All right. Here's a profile our "psychological
geniuses" have put out on John Doe.
In a nutshell, it says he's a time bomb
waiting to detonate.
Welcome to the party.
From here on out
I'm ordering a PAC on up to a 2-1-11.
A shoot to kill order?
Sir, I admitJohn Doe is unpredictable,
but he's never killed anybody.
Spoken like a true Clinton-era recruit.
<i>We're talking about a head case who</i>
<i>put a cigarette out on a man's tongue.</i>
That sound like somebody
you wanna try and reason with?
About another half hour
I'll have the next SL 27 sim ready to...
Sydney? Miss Parker?
[Man] Hey, kids, it's time for
Uncle Buddy's cartoon extravaganza.
- God I love this show.
- Fasten your funny bones and we'll be right back.

Wait, wait. I didn't know... I didn't mean
anything. Wait a minute. No, no. Wait. Wait.
- <i>I didn't</i>... <i>I didn't mean</i>...
- <i>[Reporter Continues]</i>
SL 27?
<i>SL 27?</i>
- <i>And Jell-O Brains told you this?</i>
- Not with words...
but there's no doubt
what he was saying.
John Doe is Kyle.
<i>[Joe Bill]</i>
<i>They lived up there.</i>
<i>Not so clean.</i>
<i>I haven't never been up here.</i>
Not allowed.
So everything's just
the way it was when they left?
Think so.
<i>Man made one for me one Christmas.</i>
I liked it.
<i>[Baby Crying]</i>
- There was a baby here.
- Used to hear it cry.
Never saw it.
Wasn't allowed up here.
- What is it?
- <i>My compost pile.</i>
Eyes watching me from up here.
Little eyes. Staring.
Scared me.
Never saw the baby,
but the baby saw me.
"And under the hand of God...
Ye little children shall never be lost."
I told you...
you're gonna have to wait.
But, Daddy, please.
I can't hold it anymore.
I don't care if you wet your damn pants.
Now shut the hell up!
Hey! You shouldn't
treat children like that.
[Groaning]
You're breaking it.
<i>[Groaning]</i>
<i>[Kyle]</i>
<i>Harriet.</i>
You should love your children. Always.
Hey, there, big fella.
[Grunts]
The bathroom is right over there.
- <i>Hey, where you going?</i>
<i>Hey, what's going on here?</i>
- [Starts Engine]
What kind of place is this?
That's my car.
You're not gonna believe
what's on this disk, Sydney.
- Show me. Show me.
- I'm glad you're alone.
- Why?
- [Clears Throat] Miss Parker.
Well, I'm not Scooby-Doo.
What's the problem, Broots?
Miss Parker, I know
you don't respect me...
<i>but I just don't think</i>
<i>you should watch this disk.</i>
[Scoffs]
Play the damn disk.
Hate dictates reality.
The sooner you embrace it
and focus it upon your enemy...
the sooner total control
will be realized.
It's more than just a word.
Hate is a feeling. I have it in here.
Very good, Kyle.
Feel it grow. Let it grow.
Tomorrow I'll take you to theJersey Shore,
to the Dragon House.
You like the Dragon House, don't you?
- I feel safe there.
- And you always will.
He was teaching him to hate my mother.
To shoot my mother.
I'm sorry, Miss Parker.
This explains Angelo's
sudden attack on you.
He was just simulating Kyle's intense feelings
of hatred for your mother.
I have to tell my father about this.
- [Snaps Fingers]
- If he doesn't already know.
This is the Centre.
We're talking about my mother's death.
All I am saying is we must be cautious.
All three of us.
Everything we have learned
can be traced back to SL 27.
If anyone figures that out, well.
Only your heart, Parker, can measure the
degree to which you should trust your father.
Just be careful.
[Clears Throat]
I'm sorry you had to see this.
Broots, I do respect you.
- I'm very pleased with that.
- Oh, thank you.
- [Continues, Indistinct]
- <i>[Bells Tolling]</i>
- Hi.
- <i>[Boy] Wait up for me.</i>
Let's go girls.
We don't want to be late for class.
<i>Everybody stay in line.</i>
[Gasps]
Help! Help!
Harriet!
"I decide who lives or dies."
It's a rough report. You said that if
I learned anything, I should bring it to you?
Mmm.
I'm figuring Kyle was kept here at least
10 years after the scheduled release.
Where did these
experiments take place?
I'm not sure.
Exactly how did you learn about Raines?
I'm S.I.S., Daddy. You taught me well.
You have proof to back this up?
I'd hoped that it would be enough
I were your daughter.
Of course. But I have people
to answer to. I need tangibles.
I have a source.
Can we just leave it at that?
I should've known. Another garden path
obscured byJarod's weeds.
Jarod had absolutely nothing
to do with me learning about this.
This report says that, um,
Raines taught Kyle things.
- What-What things?
- To hate. To kill.
Kill? Who?
I'm not sure... yet.
Did you know
what Raines was doing?
Would I have allowed him
to continue if I did?
There was a time when
I knew everything that went on here.
Maybe my time has passed.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
Let me run with this.
Please. And I will bring you back the best
tangible evidence that there is.
- What?
- Kyle.
Can you hear me?
Where are you?
Three doors down
from the corridor. Where are you?
Four. I'm right next to you.
<i>[Clattering]</i>
- Did you hear that?
- Yes. Maybe they know.
Do you think they know we're talking?
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>Someone does.</i>
- <i>This is Sydney.</i>
- Tell me about the Dragon House.
Was it some kind of
ad hoc torture chamber?
A Centre asylum? A safe house?
- This is about Kyle, isn't it?
- Kyle is out there.
Was he sent to kill my parents?
My God, Jarod!
I don't know. I swear it.
[Exhales]
I'll find answers.
Quickly, Sydney. Please.
- Sydney.
- Broots, I need you to do something for me.
- <i>Sure, what?</i>
- Hack into Mr. Raines's computer.
Hey, Peter. This is Dr. Jarod.
How are your gums?
- They're pink.
- Listen, I was wondering...
I'd be happy to do you a favor.
New England Air? I'd like to book
a round-trip shuttle to Boston, please.
<i>All right. Gather around, people.</i>
<i>We finally got something.</i>
A phone tip. Witness saw John Doe try to
pry open an A.T.M. machine in Boston.
- A tip from whom?
- Some kid named Goofinski.
- We got the surveillance right here.
- <i>How do you know it's him?</i>
<i>Look. Look at that scar, Ness. That's him.</i>
All right. Foster, Caine,
Charles. We're going to Boston.
- I'm checking this out personally.
- What about me? I want in.
Last thing I need is an agent
with a cold trigger finger...
- when I tell this crackpot to put his cigarette out.
- <i>Oh, come on.</i>
End of discussion.
You're an 18-11 on this one, Ness.
Oh, great. Desk duty.
The Dragon House is located in
a place called Delphi Shores, New Jersey.
- Thank you, Sydney.
- Chances are Raines will be...
zeroing in on the Dragon House too.
As you know, I have no choice but to give
Miss Parker the same information.
Go there and you won't be alone.
Loneliness is something
I left at the Centre.
One last thing, Jarod. If you find Kyle...
you have to know
he's not the person you once knew.
Neither am I.
<i>[Harriet]</i>
<i>No.</i>
- Tell me where they are.
- I can't.
I heard once that
the anticipation of pain...
is far more effective
than pain itself.
Now...
- we're gonna find out.
- <i>[Thud]</i>
My name is Jarod.
I'm here to help you.
You're late. She's with me.
I love a class reunion.
Mr. Raines.
I knew I never should've
let you two get together.
<i>Boys, let's go.</i>
I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Neither am I.
- [Gasps]
Get 'em!
Kyle, you know me. I'm Jarod.
They said Jarod was dead.
Now I decide who lives or dies.
Not this time.
I hit the Lotto!
<i>[Harriet]</i>
<i>Jarod, no.!</i>
[Miss Parker]
Jarod!
- [Sydney] Which one? Which one?
- Get Kyle!
Get in.
[Engine Starts]
<i>You could've gotten us both killed.</i>
Why did you stop me
from shooting him?
I stopped you because
Kyle is your brother.
I don't remember my parents or
anything about having a brother.
Well, you were very young when you
were taken. We often repress, forget.
How did they come to be with you?
Well, my own parents were killed
three weeks before my 11 th birthday.
I grew up in a convent, content to
give my life serving the church as a nun.
I had said my vows
and was cloistered for years.
- But it didn't take.
- Was my family tied to the convent?
No, no. There was another girl.
CatherineJamison.
We were real rabble-rousers.
Gave the Mother Superior hell.
One night we snuck out
and were crossing this frozen pond.
I slipped in. I was drowning.
Catherine dove in, dragged me out
and then breathed life back into me.
She never became a nun,
but the spirit that glowed in her...
was something I've been
unable to achieve despite years of prayer.
Then after she left the convent,
she married a man by the name of...
- Parker.
- Yes.
Catherine Parker.
- Did you know her?
- Her daughter.
What did she
have to do with my parents?
Well, in 1969,
the year I inherited this farm...
Mother Superior called
and said Catherine needed help.
Catherine showed up and asked me
to shelter a man and a woman...
who had had
their two young sons abducted.
Is that when
my parents came here?
I knew them as Charles and Margaret.
They were afraid.
They'd been searching for years...
and they were on the run.
It was safe here.
Did they ever talk
or ask about me or my brother?
They never talked. I never asked.
It was too painful.
Especially for your father.
<i>It was clear how deeply</i>
<i>he missed his sons.</i>
<i>Did they ever say</i>
<i>who they thought might've taken us?</i>
<i>I think your father was afraid it would</i>
<i>affect your mother's health.</i>
[Crying]
- The baby.
- <i>She gave birth to a little girl a month later.</i>
- <i>I have a sister.</i>
- <i>Her name is Emily.</i>
- Emily.
- <i>[Harriet Chuckles]</i>
There are no pictures.
I'm sorry.
Years later, I started getting threatening
phone calls and letters from Kyle.
<i>He must've figured out</i>
<i>I had some tie to your parents.</i>
He was desperate.
He thought I could help him.
It was after the kidnapping
that your family vanished.
You've been hiding here ever since.
I'd lost contact
with Catherine Parker years earlier.
I felt alone, and I was afraid.
So I went underground.
<i>Your parents loved you, Jarod.</i>
They loved and they missed
you and your brother.
Do you remember where you first lived
when you came to the Centre?
At first, three doors down
from the corridor entrance.
- Later, sublevel...
- What was the Manchester Solution?
The Manchester Solution.
l-I don't remember any solution
because the job was blown.
- I could've done it alone. I simmed it correct...
- [Whirring]
The others lost the will, but I didn't.
I decide who lives or dies.
I decide who lives or dies.
[Whirring]
You said after all those years in prison,
he'd remember nothing.
- He can't remember everything.
- He remembers too much.
Jarod alone is bad enough.
I brought him in.
Why is <i>he</i> here?
- I asked him to be.
- Who in the hell is Kyle anyway?
Or should I say <i>what?</i>
Kyle is someone of concern to me.
You missed Jarod. It was your best chance,
and he's still out there.
I know you're upset.
I should've told you that
I had brought Mr. Raines in on this.
I apologize. But things were
moving quickly.
Now Mr. Raines and I
will handle Kyle.
- But, Daddy...
- No, no, no. Trust me.
Sydney, do you think
Jarod might return to the Centre?
There's nothing here thatJarod wants.
And Jarod always has an objective.
Besides, even though we never
figured out how he got out...
our latest security improvements are
quite beyond anyone's capabilities.
Even Jarod's.
That's the first time I have ever heard you
doubtJarod's abilities.
Let's just hope they believed it
as much as you did.
- Get him out of here.
- No! Jarod, help!
No, leave me alone.
Jarod! Jarod!
<i>Jarod, help me.!</i>
<i>[Dog Barking In Distance]</i>
You said it was
a matter of great importance.
[Quietly]
I want you to help me get to Kyle.
- Why?
- Because he knows something
about my mother's death.
What do you want me to do? Beg?
<i>[Birds Fluttering]</i>
What makes you so certain
that Kyle can help you?
Because he was Mr. Raines's pet project.
I feel it. Sydney, I feel it.
Kyle knows who killed my mother.
Look, they're keeping him in a section
I don't have access to.
Also, they're monitoring him
round the clock from the tech room.
There's just no way for
anyone to get there undetected.
- Right?
- Mmm, well, that's not entirely true.
What do you mean?
I mean, I got us into
SL 27, didn't I?
I could probably bypass the sensors...
and at a designated time,
loop the camera feed into the monitor system.
Well, for how long?
Mmm, long enough.
[Chattering]
I was looking for... here.
[Beeps]
[Groans]
Oh, that's hot!
<i>That</i>...<i>[Grunts]</i>
<i>I'm sorry. It's okay. Got it.</i>
You look just like her.
That's what they tell me.
You're the one who decides
who lives or dies, right?
- You know my work.
- Did you kill my mother?
Did you kill my mother?
- No.
- Then who?
Was it Mr. Raines?
[Elevator Buzzes]
What are you doing here?
I was trying to find my way to
the, uh, new accounting offices.
Why do I think you're lying?
Open the door.
<i>[Wheels Squeaking]</i>
<i>[Metal Rattles]</i>
Get him out of here.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>My parents must have loved this place.</i>
I may know someone...
who can help you find
what you're looking for.
Who?
[Chuckles]
Solemn vows die hard.
I'll have to go
and see them.
Alone.
It's too dangerous.
Catherine didn't think of herself
when she pulled me out of that icy pond.
[Sighs]
I'll be...
I'll be gone a few days.
I won't be here.
I've spent every moment
since I broke out...
searching and hunting for some clue
that might lead me to my past.
And right now, the biggest clue to it
is back where I started.
I don't understand.
I'm going to get my brother.
I'm going back
to the Centre.
Hello, Sydney.
My God.
How'd you get in?
The same way I got out.
Why didn't you tell me about my family?
About my brother?
- Your brother?
- Kyle.
At least that's what
I think his name is.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't know.
<i>All I know about Kyle is</i>...
actually, whatJacob told me.
<i>[Wheels Squeaking]</i>
Am I interrupting something?
Oh. Just going over
some notes.
Of course.
Always the conscientious one.
You will notify me ifJarod attempts to
make contact with you.
What if he contacts
you first?
[Whispers]
Jarod.
Jarod.
Jarod, help me!
<i>[Clinking]</i>
Angelo.
Angelo.
[Laughs]
- Look at your hair.
- <i>[Soft Thud]</i>
CrackerJack.
C.J.
You're C.J.
You wrote those letters
to Kyle in prison.
You've been in contact with him
just like you've been in contact with me.
It's been a long time
since we've had to perform...
this kind of a radical
procedure, Dr. Raines.
And the Tower hasn't made
their approval clear yet.
I've made the diagnosis.
A frontal lobe separation
is the only way to bring him peace.
Unless you'd like to offer
a differing opinion.
- [Rattles]
- I'll call for anesthesia.
He'll be ready
in 10 minutes.
Raines.
Raines!
Who the hell are you?
I'm Jarod.
Raines said you were dead.
Not hardly.
Why are you helping me?
Because...
I'm your brother.
- I don't have any family.
- Yes. You do.
I'm guessing...
our father gave you this.
My God.
- You kept it.
- Not me.
He did.
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>It's time we all were free.</i>
[Yelling]
- <i>[Kyle Yelling]</i>
- <i>No.! No.! No.!</i>
Nobody gets hurt.
Where are we going?
Home.
Angelo, come on.
Get in.
No.
I decide who lives
or dies.
- <i>[Alarm Blaring]</i>
- Angelo. Angelo, no!
<i>[Alarm Blaring]</i>
How did this happen?
Alarm sensors indicate
they're in SL 19.
I'm on it.
I need to speak to
Mr. Parker.
- This way.
- Where does it lead?
Out. Come on.
We're on 19.
Broots, where are they?
I'm working on it.
I'm working on it.
- Go down to 20.
- [Grumbles]
Miss Parker, I'm getting a signal
in the motion detectors.
They're in the ventilation system.
Right where you are.
Rip that down.
Damn it.
It's Cousin Itt.
It's Angelo.
[Grunts]
Come on.
Trust me.
Tell me this wasn't
you, Daddy.
I know better.
I did not authorize
this procedure.
I would never do that.
Raines was prepared to destroy
a Centre investment...
with no directive
from the Tower...
to protect himself
from what Kyle knows.
We've both been feeling it
for a long time.
Raines has had his own
agenda long enough.
He'll be dealt with.
Just bring me back
what belongs to the Centre.
[Yells]
- It's okay.
- [Yells]
It's okay.
It's okay.
Here.
It's one of the small joys of freedom.
There's candy
underneath the head.
Ah...
<i>That's okay.</i>
<i>I have plenty more.</i>
We just gonna drive?
I know a place
where we can rest.
How long you been out?
Almost a year now.
<i>There's so much out here.</i>
You have so much
catching up to do.
You do remember.
That Kyle was
a million years ago, Jarod.
<i>By the time I broke from the Centre,</i>
<i>my head was mush.</i>
All I thought about
was finding my...
finding our parents.
<i>And anybody got in my way,</i>
<i>I just ran over 'em.</i>
Before long,
I was running from the law.
By the time I figured things out
and got to Harriet...
<i>I just</i>...
I never wanted to hurt her.
I just thought
she knew where they were.
[Jarod]
Something good came out of it.
At least we have
a place to start.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Well, that's the rest of it.</i>
He's gone through
everything we have.
Jarod's notebooks, F.B.I. files,
everything we've got on Kyle.
He's almost done.
[Sydney]
Real glutton for punishment, hmm?
Desperate times,
desperate measures, Sydney.
If Sponge Boy here really can become anyone,
like all the quacks around here claim...
then I'm letting him become Kyle and Jarod
at the same time.
- Maybe he'll tell me where they went.
- [Yells]
Maybe we should have
tethered him.
Aren't we making one
erroneous assumption, Dr. Parker?
What's he gonna blow?
A transistor?
- You assume that he wants to help you.
- Why wouldn't he?
Just let this quack
handle it, hmm?
Jarod.
Jarod. If you're really
in there, Jarod...
then you'll know who I am...
and that I can help you.
Also, that I am
the only one...
who can protect you
from Mr. Raines.
[Grunting]
Easy. Easy.
I'm going home.
I'm safe here.
Kyle kidnapped a woman
named Harriet Tashman.
He was trying to get her
to this place.
[Wheels Squeaking]
- I can feel them here.
- I know.
But they don't
have faces.
'Cause we don't remember.
Or the Centre
didn't let us remember.
Maybe this will help.
She's beautiful.
They're still out there,
aren't they?
Yes. Them...
and our sister.
She was born
after we were gone.
Dad taught me.
We're going to find them.
We wouldn't have gotten this far
unless we were meant to.
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>
Korkos.
Do you want to know
whereJohn Doe is?
<i>[Metal Clangs]</i>
<i>Harriet.</i>
We didn't know it was you.
It's all right.
<i>We all want the same thing.</i>
- I have some good news.
- <i>[Vehicle Approaching]</i>
Somebody's coming up the road.
Let's get out of here.
Get 'em.
[Jarod]
Hold on!
[Yells]
- [Groans]
- Kyle.
- Kyle!
- Hold still. Let me look.
No. Go.
My leg is broken.
No. I'm not going to
leave you here.
Jarod, go!
Find our parents.
Don't tell them what I became.
<i>Come on, Jarod.</i>
<i>Come on, Jarod.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>
Freeze. F.B.I.
No!
Come on, Jarod. Jarod.
Jarod.
Jarod.
- Jarod, we have to split up.
- No. Come on. I can protect you.
No. This is not
about me now.
Your parents.
They're in Boston.
They'll arrive by taxi
at this coffee shop.
Here's the address and meet time.
Tomorrow at 3:00.
Harriet, thank you.
[Raines]
It was a prudent move with Kyle.
<i>Keeps our hands clean.</i>
<i>[Mr. Parker]</i>
<i>I think we should focus on bringing Jarod in.</i>
We have a possible location.
- Where? When?
- 3:00. Today.
<i>Take a Sweeper team with you.</i>
<i>Bring him back.</i>
<i>[Wheels Squeaking]</i>
<i>[Bell Tolling]</i>
- We're flying blind.
- No need, Miss Parker.
- Well, don't count on Mr. Raines
feeling the same way.
- I don't.
Well, let me show you how to take off
the safety, huh?
Damn.
I don't want
Jarod hurt.
Do my best, Syd.
- It's hot and good to go.
- Damn.
You take the east.
Got that?
You take the west.
I'll float.

[Groaning]
Hello, Jarod.
You stole me
from my parents.
You had the F.B.I.
kill my brother.
And now you're trying to kill my family.
What have I ever done to you?
You exist.
No.
I'm not gonna let you do to me
what you did to my brother.
You leave me alone.
<i>[Gunshot]</i>
<i>[Groaning]</i>
I thought he gave up smoking.
<i>No. No, no, no.</i>
<i>There was no plant.</i>
The information on Jarod's rendezvous
with his parents...
came from a phone tap we've had
on St. Catherine's for over 30 years.
Yes, Mr. Lyle.
Uh, Jarod got away, but...
You want me to come in? What for?
Let's talk now.
Whatever you say.
I'll be with you shortly.
We will. You have my word.
Thank...
Ah. Glad you're here.
- Really?
- Of course. We have work to do.
We?
Now that Raines is in
doctors' hands... or God's.
Skin grafts can be
so demanding.
Well, at least he'll be out of your hair.
Isn't that what you wanted?
- Is that what <i>you</i> wanted?
- He overstepped.
I dealt with him
as promised.
Then why was he out
on that street yesterday?
Why did he know
right whereJarod would be?
Difficult for a man like Raines
to end up in hospital...
while sitting behind his desk,
don't you think?
You promised me
that we would talk.
Did Raines kill Mother?
Honey. There are
no easy answers.
- Yes or no.
- <i>One day you'll understand why l</i>...
Did he kill her?
There are still great repercussions
from your mother's death.
When I can tell you more,
I will.
- <i>Trust me.</i>
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
Ah, you're here
to escort me?
Of course you are.
<i>[Mr. Parker Coughs]</i>
A friend of mine in cleanup
sent me this.
- Ballistics report?
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>
- What the hell's going on here?
- I don't follow.
Well, the bullet that
struck the oxygen tank...
They can't tell which gun
it was fired from.
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>
Hello. This is Sydney.
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Hello. Who's there?</i>
I may be tired, Sydney...
but I'll never give up.
I don't expect you to.
I'll find them again.
No one is going to
keep me from my family.
I understand.
Jarod, you were closer to your family
than I ever was.
I want you to believe that.
If it's my faith you want...
tell me where
they buried my brother.
- Buried him?
- Kyle. Yes.
- Jarod.
- Tell me, Sydney.
The van's gas tank
was full.
It burned for
a very long time.
No remains were found.
Nothing. Nada.
Hmm.
Which is, yet again,
what you leave me with.
Jarod. Hello.
Are you still there?
I'm here.
With everything
that's happened...
they're more determined
than ever to find you.
Do you know where you'll go?
I have a good idea.
- Catch me if you can.

Yes.
<i>Oh.</i>
Yes. Keep me informed.
Disposal team discovered a body

Sydney?
It's too soon to tell.
They need more pieces.
Daddy, if- if the remains down there
are Sydney's, then-
<i>Forget Sydney.</i>
I didn't put this bombing report
together as a condemnation.
Sydney planted the bomb...
but he acted out of a misdirected sense
of guilt and compassion.
Misdirected guilt and compassion killed
your mother. I will not allow it to kill you!
What's going on, Daddy?
Triumvirate is applying great pressure
for a change in strategy.
They're not removing me
from Jarod's pursuit?
[Chuckles]
Oh, no. I would never allow that.
Ah, 'twas a bloody fight.
Most important,
none of it was yours or mine.
Then what?
Well, they insist
on adding a new player.
<i>Their selection</i>
<i>is due in tomorrow.</i>
Is that necessary?
Desperate times.
<i>[Click]</i>
<i>Centre Records lab.</i>
<i>Surveillance feed</i>

<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Jarod.</i>
<i>His body survived the blast.</i>
<i>I'm not so sure about his mind.</i>
<i>[Jarod Grunting]</i>
[Panting, Shouts]
- <i>[Jarod] Kri kra toad's foot.</i>
- <i>[Man] Help!</i>
Kri kra toad's foot.
Geese walk barefoot.
- Hold him!
- Come on!
Kri kra toad's foot.
Geese walk barefoot.
Kri kra toad's foot.
Geese walk barefoot.
- Who the hell was that guy?
- I don't think he knows. Let's go.
Where are my mom and dad?
[Screams]
Where are my mom and dad?
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent every moment
searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
[Elevator Bell Dings]
Did you hear about
the body?
- Was it Sydney?
- No. Thank God, no.
It was that bleached-out
Sweeper. That guy Gar.
Hmm. There's one less
vacancy in hell.
- Oh, man. It's all too weird.
- Tell me about it.
- <i>Haven't seen that ghoul all week.</i>
- <i>[Broots] Oh, no one has.</i>
- I hear he's practically living over in Renewal Wing.
- Renewal Wing?
That's for head cases
and invalids.
Well, he is sort of both.
<i>What? Do you think</i>
<i>he's up to something?</i>
<i>He's always up to something.</i>
<i>Sydney blew up his old playground.</i>
- I'm gonna go see if he's found a new one.
- What? In Renewal Wing?
- Have you gone crazy?
- Everyone has.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Geese walk barefoot.</i>
Kri kra toad's foot.
Wagon from County
brought him in.
John Doe. No I.D.
<i>They found him lassoin'Harleys</i>
<i>over at the, uh, Dairy Queen.</i>
Kept insistin'
he was a rodeo clown.
Hardly a reason
for a straitjacket.
Hey. You're the shrinks. All I know is
it took six troopers to subdue him.
- Thanks, Jimbo. We'll manage from here.
- All right then.
Well, he definitely looks troubled,
so let's give him...
a comprehensive evaluation and determine
what level security to put him at.
<i>Kri kra toad's foot.</i>
<i>Geese walk barefoot.</i>
Hi there.
I'm Dr. Goetz, and this is Dr. Blythe.
Geese walk barefoot.
- <i>[Goetz] We're both here to help you.</i>
- Kri kra toad's-
Where are my mom and dad?
- Why don't we start with a name?
- Jarod.
What's your last name?
I don't know.
It changes every week.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>You know Mr. Raines is looking for you?</i>
- <i>[Man #2] He wants to see me now?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Come with me.
<i>Who's there?</i>
My God. Sydney.
Miss Parker.
- I thought you were-
- Dead.
Give them time.
What the hell have they been doing
to you down here?
<i>[Woman Screams]</i>
I believe the term
is "reeducation."
But I would plant the bomb again
to save that child.
Sydney, there's nothing
I can do to save you from this.
I'm not interested
in saving myself.
<i>Jarod. Was he able to</i>
<i>make it out safely?</i>
In body, yes.
Jarod flipped out...
pulled a psycho Martha Stewart
at a Centre Records lab.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>That's what I've been afraid of all this time-</i>
that one day the pressure of living
in the outside world...
and the truth about his past
would come crashing down upon him.
I need your help.
I have to bring him in...
<i>and I need to know</i>
<i>exactly what I'm up against.</i>
The anguish in his cry-
It comes from deep within.
[Panting, Shouts]
Hmm.
Oh, Sydney.
You can't see.
<i>Call it poetic justice.
There must be something.
<i>Bring me anything Jarod left</i>
<i>behind before he did this.</i>
They will never
let me out of here.
And there's little time.
This may be my last chance
to helpJarod...
or you.
<i>[Goetz] Why don't you tell me</i>
<i>who you are and where you came from?</i>
You wouldn't believe me.
Try me.
I was stolen from my parents as a child,
and I was raised by a place called the Centre.
<i>Think hell.</i>
With nicer furniture.
Where exactly is this Centre?
It's everywhere.
<i>Can I draw a picture?</i>
<i>I like to draw.</i>
Maybe later.
Why don't you tell me
a little bit about this Centre?
No windows.
No doors.
No light.
No hope.
They take all that away.
- They?
- The ones that decided...
what I ate, when I slept...
<i>who I saw, when I talked.</i>
They decided everything I did.
How did they do this to you?
They had eyes in every ceiling,
every wall. They never blinked.
<i>They were always on me.</i>
<i>Every minute, every hour...</i>
every day of my life.
Why'd they do this to you?
To control me.
I'm a Pretender.
<i>I can become</i>
<i>anyone I want to be.</i>
Except I don't know
who I am.
I've been a shrink before.
It's really very overrated.
You don't believe me.
Only you know the truth.
The truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help me God.
I was a lawyer once too.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Never would have pegged him as a fake.</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Never would have pegged him as a fake.</i>
This Jarod you're looking
for was a janitor here.
A damn good one.
Very convincing.
Always is.
I don't suppose you put together
any kind of missing inventory list?
Uh, we're just
a records office really...
and none of the physical
archives are missing.
And has any data
been compromised?
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Miss Parker. I found it.</i>
J-
Jarod.
[Whispers]
Jarod tapped into the two ban six file.
<i>Major Charles. He was looking for</i>
<i>his father in the Centre records.</i>
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Catherine Parker.</i>
He was looking for a connection
between his father and your mother.
This is everything he had in his locker.
Hope it helps.
Oh, my. Heavy-duty drugstore.
[Miss Parker]
Yeah. And the library for the shattered mind.
You think whateverJarod found out about
his father and your mother caused this?
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>
- [Screams]
<i>[Gunshot]</i>
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>
- [Screams]
<i>[Jarod] Miss Parker's mother</i>
<i>was murdered by the Centre...</i>
and her father-
[Chuckles]
Mr. Duplicity himself-
He runs the place.
Then there's Mr. Raines...
the Centre's answer
to Dr. Mengele...
an emphysema-riddled corpse who
drags around his breath of life in a tank.
<i>Is there anyone else</i>
<i>you want to tell me about?</i>
The thumbless man.
<i>Mr. Lyle.</i>
He killed my brother.
He killed me once too.
<i>And of course...</i>
Sydney.
- Who's Sydney?
- Pavlov to my dog.
Provider. Protector.
<i>Patriarch.</i>
He created me.
You see, I'm extremely
valuable to the Centre.
And while I search
for who I am...
they search for me.
<i>[Goetz]</i>
<i>He certainly believes it.</i>
<i>[Blythe]</i>
<i>That's what scares me. I say keep him restrained...</i>
<i>and place him in a
<i>max security section.</i>
<i>[Goetz] There's a tormented boy inside,</i>
<i>but I don't think he's dangerous.</i>
<i>[Blythe] Carla, it took</i>
<i>six policemen to subdue him last night.</i>
- <i>Let's not take any chances.</i>
- <i>[Goetz] I want to work with him.</i>
<i>[Blythe]</i>
<i>You will have time.</i>
<i>With his paranoid delusions</i>
<i>and multiple personalities...</i>
<i>I doubt he's ever</i>
<i>gonna leave this place.</i>
<i>[Sydney] Neuro-inhibitors,</i>
<i>antidepressants, antipsychotics.</i>
- Self-medicating.
- Not likeJarod.
Well, the man who destroyed
that room is not likeJarod.
- Well-
- Oh.
<i>"Shedding Light</i>
<i>on the Schizophrenic Mind''....</i>
<i>"Dementia. The Phantom Within,"</i>
<i>"Dementia Praecox."</i>
They're all books on a-
on a troubled mind.
If we'd only gotten
to him sooner-
I wish things were
different too, Syd, but-
but all the pieces
to this crazy jigsaw fit.
Hmm.
[Broots]
Not this one.
[Grunts]
[Gasps]
It's okay.
My name is Jarod.
I'm sorry it took me
so long to get here.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>I have a brother out there.</i>
<i>[Jarod] I've narrowed your brother's identity</i>
<i>down to these two files.</i>
<i>One of these files</i>
<i>belong to him...</i>
<i>and the other</i>
<i>to a boy named Bobby.</i>
<i>But you know him better</i>
<i>as Mr. Lyle.</i>
I need a drink.
A big one.
Who killed my mother?
- Jarod's father.
- <i>[Gunshots]</i>
[Screams]
<i>[Angelo]</i>
<i>Miss Parker. Confused.</i>
Scared.
Are you my brother?
Hope.
- Maybe I'm the crazy one.
- <i>[Broots] Miss Parker!</i>
<i>Miss Parker.</i>
<i>Miss Parker.</i>
- [Panting]
- You're starting to sound like Dr. Fester.
I'm sorry, but I was tryin' to find you
all over this place.
- Well?
- He's here.
- Who's here?
- Him.
<i>I believe "him"is me.</i>
What the hell
are you doing here, Lyle?
I'm here to help you
catch Jarod.
It's good to be home again.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>She looks very sad.</i>
<i>[Jimbo]</i>
<i>Mary? Yeah, she is.</i>
She wasn't so bad when she first
came in here for nervous exhaustion...
<i>but one night about two years ago,</i>
<i>she broke out, tried to offherself.</i>
<i>Gotten worse ever since.</i>
She should've listened
to her doctors.
You should too.
<i>[Lock Clicks]</i>
[No Audible Dialogue]
- Thank you for releasing me from my shackles.
- You're welcome.
This is for you.
For your drawings.
You know, you've told me an awful lot
about where you came from...
and all the people
that were there...
but the one thing that you haven't
told me about is Jarod.
That's because
I don't know who I am.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Mary.</i>
Do you know who this is?
- Erica.
- Yes.
She had a pretty bracelet.
You ran away with Erica
that night.
<i>[Mary]</i>
<i>Through the woods.</i>
Run. Erica,
we have to get away.
Erica ran through the woods,
but she got away?
Erica's gone.
- Where is she?
- Erica's wet.
[Gasps]
<i>The water's so cold. L-</i>
- Erica's in the water.
- [Whimpers]
<i>Can't find her.
I'm coming, Erica.
Hang on.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Mary. Mary.
Mary, Mary, Mary.
I want you to listen to me. Listen to me.
Listen to me.
I want you to stop
taking your medication.
It's been making your mind
sick when it's really not.
Someone has been trying
to make you forget...
and it's very, very important
for you to remember.
Okay?
Okay?
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
<i>ClearlyJarod's crazy.
Which, in my opinion, is the only
explanation for his carelessness.
The question is why?
Why has Jarod gone off the deep end?
- And how did he manage to-
- Wait. Stop.
Just how in the hell
did you get back in here?
I believe the Triumvirate...
as well as your father...
see me as a man who's willing to literally
sacrifice his own flesh and blood...
- for what he believes in.
- <i>As opposed to...</i>
kidnapping, embezzling
murderer?
It's all perspective.
Some see a missing thumb.
<i>Others, four perfectly</i>
<i>good fingers.</i>
I'm having a hell of a time
getting this thing to heal over.
But like I said, sacrifice.
You know they actually offered to transplant
my big toe to re-create a new thumb?
Nobody re-creates
quite like you, Bobby.
<i>Tell me, Parker.</i>
Exactly what are you
willing to sacrifice?
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Well, my mother sacrificed more than her thumb...</i>
and I'm willing to give
just as much as she did.
Ow.
Sorry.
[Miss Parker]
It'd be a shame to lose both of those.
<i>Why would Maryjump in the water?</i>
<i>She didn'tjump to kill herself.</i>
She jumped because Erica
was in the water.
If I were you, Sydney,
I would eat.
<i>I question how many more opportunities</i>
<i>you'll have to do so.</i>
<i>[Apple Crunches]</i>
What more, Raines?
Who's there?
A friend.
- Ow.
- Sorry.
Florence Nightingale I'm not.
- Truth.
- Yes, Angelo.
I'm searching for the truth.
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. I'm not very good
with blood, Miss Parker.
What did you find out?
Who brought Mr. Lyle back?
Actually, it was your-
your father.
My father wanted Mr. Lyle?
Well, from what
I could find out, he-
he pulled strings from Europe to Asia
to get him reinstated.
What the hell
are you doing with this?
Broots, I want you...
to D.N.A. Fingerprint
these samples.
Okay.
It's time I shook up the family tree,
see who falls out.
<i>[Keys Jingle]</i>
Stay put,
and stay out of trouble.
Thank you for caring.
Give it.
[Jarod]
Kleptomania is a hard habit to break.
Mm-hmm. Fingers aren't.
[Beeps]
<i>[Lock Clicks]</i>
<i>[Goetz]</i>
<i>You're hiding something.</i>
- Why do you say that?
- Oh, you're a textbook case, Jarod.
You did just the right things to get yourself
in here. Not too much. Not too little.
You didn't hurt yourself
or anyone else doing it.
The question is why
you want to be here.
You're the shrink.
Well, it's not uncommon
for released prison inmates...
to commit offenses to
return them to the security...
<i>of an institutionalized</i>
<i>environment.</i>
The Centre sounds like
such an environment.
I just don't think that
you want to go back there.
No.
Which brings us back to
why you're really here.
To heal.
<i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>
<i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>
- What?
- [Jarod] Did Sydney get his eyes back yet?
How the hell do you know
about that?
<i>Calm down, Miss Parker.
Stress left unchecked
creates madness.
Well, then Hitler
should have taken up yoga.
How'd you get out
after the blast?
Well, if I told you that, Miss Parker,
it wouldn't be any fun.
How did Daddy make out?
Better than yours will-
when I find him.
Misplaced aggression
causes madness too.
<i>You</i> cause madness, Jarod.
Or should I call you Freud
or Houdini this week?
Well, that is what makes me mad, Miss Parker.
You see, I don't know who I am.
But, of course, you have the same reason
now for sleepless nights.
How does it feel?
Trying to define the branches
of your family tree.
The identity of my brother
is my problem.
It's both our problems.
Of course, the Parker family picnic
will never be the same.
[Beeps]
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>I'd know that Chanel anywhere.</i>
Sydney.
What are you doing here?
<i>We're working.</i>
Together.
<i>As a team.</i>
Whoop-de-do.
Just one big
happy family, huh, Syd?
<i>I'm sorry. I must still have some ringing</i>
<i>in my ears from that bomb blast.</i>
<i>You remember the blast,</i>
<i>don't you, Syd?</i>
<i>[Mr. Lyle]</i>
<i>Interesting about that.</i>
Upon further review, I realized
you'd reached the wrong conclusion.
Sydney wouldn't have
planted that bomb.
- <i>It was Gar.</i>
- Gar.
Gar couldn't light a stick of dynamite
if he had a road map to the fuse.
- And why would he?
- Well, the truth...
<i>unfortunately,</i>
<i>goes to the grave with him.</i>
Tragedy.
But a fortunate one
for you, Syd...
that the Ken doll here
corrected overnight...
the mistakes my report
took a week to find.
No. The fortunate thing is the powers that be
agreed with my findings.
Would that be the powers
from Europe or from Asia?
The ones that count.
Gee. Syd, I know
you're blind. L-
I just didn't realize deaf and dumb
came with the package.
You don't understand,
Parker.
It's crystal clear.
You've sold your soul to save your ass.
<i>I just hope you don't get burned by the guy</i>
<i>with the horns and the little red pitchfork.</i>
L-You know, l-
I believe you're confusing
intelligence with guile.
- We do have work to do.
- Yes.
"We."
There's the operative word.
<i>[Mr. Lyle]</i>
<i>Are you in on this pursuit or not?</i>
Jarod contacted me earlier.
He sounded different. Disturbed.
<i>I came here to research</i>
<i>the Centre records ofhis psych profile...</i>
try and understand
his behavior.
Great minds. Sydney and I were just exploring
Jarod's dive off the deep end as well.
You think he's really
gone crazy?
Maybe he's pretending
to have lost his faculties...
so as not to stand out from
others who have lost theirs.
- <i>[Mr. Lyle] Like in an asylum.</i>
- Hmm. Well, he'd certainly fit in around here.
I stopped taking them,
like you said.
Good girl.
<i>Mary, I found the car</i>
<i>in the water.</i>
<i>I found Erica.</i>
Mary...
do you think you could tell me about
the night that you tried to escape?
Oh, I see things in my head.
- I'm not sure what to believe.
- Trust yourself.
Dr. Blythe doesn't have
control of your mind anymore.
Well, Erica and I
had become friends here.
She was kind and funny.
After a while, l-
I could tell there was...
something bothering her.
Then she told me.
What did she tell you?
That she was going to
have a baby.
Dr. Blythe gave her
the baby.
He took advantage of her
during her therapy sessions.
Dr. Blythe wanted the baby
to go away.
She was scared.
<i>Confused.
So I decided to...
help her escape.
So you ran away
through the woods...
- <i>but something stopped you.</i>
- Oh!
<i>[Mary]</i>
<i>Headlights.</i>
Dr. Blythe.
<i>Yeah. He called out to her.</i>
- <i>He- He said he wanted to talk</i>
<i>to her about keeping the baby.</i>
- Come here.
No!
<i>I told her</i>
<i>not to believe him.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>But she went to talk to him anyway.</i>
There was no talk.
<i>It all happened so fast.</i>
<i>He hit her so hard</i>
<i>she stopped moving.</i>
<i>I can see he was panicked.</i>
<i>I was frozen with fear.</i>
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>
Erica in the water.
You tried to save Erica...
<i>but Dr. Blythe saw you.</i>
<i>You surprised him because he thought</i>
<i>that Erica tried to run away by herself.</i>
He held me under the water
until the car came.
- <i>[Jarod] Car?</i>
- <i>[Mary] The orderly.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Jimbo?</i>
- <i>So now he had a witness.</i>
- Dr. Blythe!
<i>So he couldn't kill you, so he-</i>
<i>he dragged you out of the water...</i>
and then he concocted this story
about two escaped patients-
one who got away and the other
who was suicidal and incoherent.
I'm not crazy.
No. Mary, you are not crazy.
Dr. Blythe gave you
this medication...
<i>so you would think you were crazy</i>
<i>so you couldn't tell this story.</i>
But it's time that someone
told the truth.
For Erica.
<i>And for you.</i>
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>
- [Jarod] Dr. Blythe.
- Yes.
This is Trooper Raines,
Maryland State Police.
Sorry to get you up so early.
I'm a busy man. I get up early every day.
What- How can I help you?
Well, it's not what you can do for me.
It's more what I can do for you.
Good news.
We found your car.
- My car?
- 1994 Mercedes. ZYP 959.
A couple of fishermen found it submerged
out at Wilson Lake.
Did they, uh,
find anything... in the car?
Well, it's still too dark
to be sure of anything...
except the fact that
it is indeed your car.
- It is funny though.
- Funny?
Well, looks like it's been down there
for a couple of years, but...
you never missed a registration payment
and you never reported it missing.
- I guess you are a busy man.
- [Beeps]
[Dial Tone]
Of all the psychiatric
institutions in North America...
20 have had John Does
admitted in the last few days.
- Anything?
- Well, we're getting close.
I'm down to
the last 10 here.
[Beeps, Twittering]
<i>Pleasant Wood Psychiatric Institute,</i>
<i>Towson, Maryland.</i>
It all seems way too easy.
Believe it.
<i>Cuckoo Boy's there.
- But why would he leave us a trail right to him?
- Simple.
It's Jarod's way of telling us
he's still in control.
Bus is leaving.
Save you a seat?
<i>[Ducks Quacking]</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Erica's not in there.</i>
I gave her the dignity
that you wouldn't.
- What are you doing out of the asylum?
- Repaying a debt...
<i>for two women.</i>
One whose life you stole...
the other whose mind
you nearly destroyed.
- You're mad.
- Well, it's a mad, mad world.
But don't worry.
You're not going to be in it much longer.
You're no patient.
- And you are no doctor.
- Ow!
Just another coward
running from the truth.
Let go of me!
Let me out of here!
- Thought maybe you'd like to go
for a little ride in your car.
- Please?
Erica didn't get to plead
for her life. Did she?
<i>Or Mary, when you began feeding her</i>
<i>hallucinogens to make her think she was crazy.</i>
You don't understand! I didn't have any choice!
So please let me out of here!
Mmm. No.
- <i>Three victims. Three ruined lives.</i>
- <i>No! Don't!</i>
- One who died.
- [Screams]
One who has to live
with that memory.
<i>[Blythe]</i>
<i>Let me out!</i>
And an unborn baby
who never got a chance.
<i>Now I wouldn't want all that</i>
<i>on my mind when I met my Maker.</i>
- I'd feel like-
- <i>Please, no! Let me out!</i>
- Like you do right now.
- <i>No!</i>
Let me out!
<i>[Shouts]</i>
<i>[Man] You know, he's lucky you came along</i>
<i>when you did, Dr. Ratched...</i>
<i>or he'd have drowned</i>
<i>himself sure enough.</i>
- But, uh, we'll take care of him.
- No!
He's suffering from classic
paranoid schizophrenia.
Delusional behavior
and total self-destructive tendencies.
I'm ordering full-time restraints
and complete isolation.
You gotta help me.
This guy tried to kill me.
Sure he did, pal. We'll make sure
he doesn't try to hurt himself again.
<i>No! He's not a doctor!</i>
<i>He's a mental-</i>
- <i>I'm the doctor!</i>
- We'll be back to do an evaluation in, oh...
72 hours.
Don't believe him!
I'm the doctor! I'm the-
l- I'm not crazy.
I am not crazy.
Ow!
<i>Doctor, tell me again.</i>
<i>Where did you say you practiced?</i>
Our primary clinic is in Delaware,
which is whereJarod is maintained.
Here we are.
And there he went.
Jimbo, notify the gate
we have a possible escapee.
Your family's very excited
about you coming home, Mary.
You're gonna be okay.
- I know I am.
- Come on.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>I'm the one who missed Boy Wonder again.</i>
Why are you the one who looks like
you swallowed a razor?
[Chuckles]
Well, l- I might feel better if I had.
Um, the genetic blood test results on your brother.
[Clears Throat]
- Conclusive?
- Oh- Oh, yeah.
Tell me it's Angelo.
Well, l- I wish I could.
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
- This is Sydney.
- How's your sight?
My sight is gone for now.
But my vision is in some ways
clearer than ever.
I see you've found
a way to survive again.
As have you.
- It's a crazy world.
- But you're not.
- You're just lost, Jarod.
- For now.
But somewhere out there
I'll find my way.
And I'll find out who I am.
[Beeps]
Maybe I will too.
- <i>[Man] Hop in.</i>
- Thanks.
- Dad?
- Dad?
Is that you?
- No!
- No! No!
[Engine Starts]
<i>Mama!</i>
<i>[Miss Parker's Voice]</i>
<i>Mr. Fenigor, who killed my mother?</i>
Jarod's father.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Daddy, it's the truth.</i>
Mother's death was not
what we thought.
She was gunned down
in this elevator byJarod's father.
- Fenigor told you this.
- He's dying in the Centre infirmary.
<i>He has no reason to lie.</i>
- He extorted a lot of money from this place.
- This place? Or you?
I didn't want him
telling lies.
- About your mother.
- Are they lies?
[Exhales Sharply]
<i>Hope I'm, uh, not interrupting.</i>
- Keep hoping.
- Angel, please.
Your sister's obsessed with finding
Jarod's father instead of the real target.
Funny you should
mention Jarod, <i>Dad.</i>
- He put this Web site on the Net.
- <i>[Mr. Parker] Can we trace it?</i>
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>No. We've tried similar leads before.</i>
She's right.
It's unlikely, but I'm workin' on it.
All right.
Keep me informed.
- Keep us both informed.
- Oh, of course.
And while I'm tracking Jarod,
you'll be, what, after his father?
I find his father,
I find him.
<i>[Chirping]</i>
<i>[Bird Screeches]</i>
[Man]
You gonna have somethin'?
Actually, I was supposed to
meet someone here.
And I'm supposed to sell drinks.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>All right. I'll take anything cold.</i>
Jarod?
Mike Bodie?
Would have been here sooner, but I had to
stop at my place and grab something.
God, you remind me
of him.
My father.
Major Charles.
That's why I left
the message on the Web site.
You knew him.
A dream catcher.
Your father made it.
There's a part of him in that.
Now it's a part of you.
All I have is this.
A reflection.
I can top that.
- Is this my father?
- And me, 20 years ago.
I thought you should have it.
[Groans]
<i>You've been shot.</i>
- That's what happens when
someone's trying to kill you.
- Who?
I'm sorry, Jarod.
I didn't want it
to come down like this.
I can help you.
I'm the one that owes you.
- Mike.
- I want to tell you everything about your father...
<i>and his dream quest.</i>
Mike! Mike!
Damn.
[Panting]
[Groans]
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
- What happened to Mr. Fenigor?
- <i>[Mr. Lyle] He's assumed room temperature.</i>
In a manner of speaking.
- He's dead?
- That's what I'm told.
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to hear from Fenigor himself...
thatJarod's father
killed our mother.
Daddy told you?
Doesn't matter.
Too late now anyway.
We'll never know for sure.
We will when I find
Jarod's father.
<i>Finding him-</i>
<i>It's not about catching Jarod, is it?</i>
<i>What's it about?</i>
<i>Revenge?</i>
- My mother deserves it.
- She was <i>our</i> mother.
What about our father?
I mean, have you thought about what opening
these old wounds might do to him?
You know, the fact that you're my sister
doesn't change one thing.
You are beautiful
when you're angry.
You've never seen me angry.
Ow.
<i>Damn bounty hunters- think</i>
<i>they're playing cowboys and Indians.</i>
- Bounty hunters?
- Yeah.
What were they doing
after Mike?
Bail jumping's kind of
a habit with Mike Bodie.
Thinks he's a modern-day
<i>Crazy Horse.
<i>Just wish he'd stay on his own</i>
<i>land instead of comin'onto mine.</i>
- <i>[Shotgun Blast]</i>
- <i>[Mike] Hey. Hey. Don't shoot!</i>
- <i>I'm not armed! Hey! Look. No, no-</i>
- <i>[Shotgun Blasts]</i>
<i>Don't shoot!</i>
That's what happens when
someone's trying to kill you.
Hope you're here
to check the meter.
<i>Not today.</i>
Today I'm just hunting a bounty.
- Like you.
- Is that right? What's your name?
Jarod...
Green.
- I. D?
- The diploma's out in theJeep.
Are you going to shoot me?
Not if you stay
out of my way.
Looks like he left
in a mighty hurry.
Shotguns are a great motivator.
They hit him over here,
and then he jumped out that window.
Seems you've done this before.
You got a name to go with that shotgun?
Kim...
Peace.
<i>Mike Bodie is</i>
<i>some kind of activist.</i>
Terrorist is more like it.
Blew up a mining rig.
That's why he's worth 20K.
My 20K.
Hmm.
Twenty grand.
- Enough to share.
- I don't share bounties.
How about coffee?
- <i>[Kim] Where'd you say you're from?</i>
- Delaware.
Mmm.
<i>That's a whole lot of</i>
<i>hunters for one man.</i>
Twenty grand brings out
the best and the brightest.
Kimberly.
Who's your new friend?
More competition.
- Jarod Green.
- Dennis Beers.
Looks like we're after
the same Injun.
May the best man win.
Bet ya a hundred bucks one of those
poor excuses shot up Mike's place.
Maybe they're after
a dead skip.
What makes you think
they're tryin' to kill him?
Well, for starters, the bloodstains
and the shotgun blasts.
Scare tactics. These guys are not
in the killing business.
Worst case,
Bodie'll get roughed up.
You didn't rough me up.
I'm an old-fashioned girl.
Now you-
You're kind of a riddle.
<i>No handcuffs. No gun.</i>
<i>YourJeep's a rental.</i>
And no wedding ring.
<i>I got a hunch you don't have</i>
<i>a place to call home.</i>
Well, I could say
the same thing about you.
Are you sure you won't
consider a team effort?
Thanks for the flapjacks,
Delaware.
Broots.
How- How'd you know
it was me?
Too much Old Spice.
[Whispers]
You won't believe what I snagged.
[Clears Throat]
Well, don't let me stop you.
Oh- Oh, you know that, uh- the Web site
you wanted me to trace?
Well, uh, you know, it's untraceable.
Appears as ifJarod had programmed it...
- to jump to a different server every 18 hours.
- So you haven't found it?
No.
<i>Dead ends are</i>
<i>Jarod's specialty.</i>
Keep searching.
For a while I thought I was gonna swallow
my tongue.
That's all I could dig up on Fenigor.
It's a death certificate.
<i>They kept him alive for two extra days</i>
<i>to harvest his organs.</i>
His kidneys are in Kansas. His liver's in New York.
His spleen's in Spokane.
- Get me a picture.
- Of his spleen?
- His corpse.
- You don't believe the file.
The only thing I believe
is if Lyle brings in Jarod instead of me...
Fenigor won't be the only supplier
to the Organ of the Month Club.
<i>Parker, are you sure this isn't about</i>
<i>revenge againstJarod's father?</i>
Find me the old man's body
before there's another one.
- Sydney.
- Ah.
What if Lyle finds Jarod
before Miss Parker?
- What would happen then?
- To her?
[Whispers]
No. To us.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I'm a bounty hunter. Why do you need my name?</i>
<i>You know, the state may say you've got</i>
<i>jurisdiction, but this is my neighborhood...</i>
and you don't operate on these lands
without registering.
<i>And I don't appreciate</i>
<i>no bounty hunter...</i>
stormin' through here
like The Man With No Name.
So, Bodie bombed a mining rig?
<i>Well, A.C.M. 's have been...</i>
makin' copper digs
just outside the res.
Mike didn't want 'em
near his property.
His house is not
on the reservation.
<i>Just outside. His land was parceled</i>
<i>to his ancestors a hundred years ago.</i>
I have a picture of Mike
as a little boy.
Do you recognize
the man with him?
<i>You're best to talk to Emery.</i>
<i>He's the history buff. Emery!</i>
Yeah.
<i>You know this guy?</i>
Mm-mmm. Sorry.
Thank you.
You're not a bounty hunter.
Mike's dream catcher-You would've
had to kill him to take it off his neck.
So he must have
given it to you.
You know Mike?
He's part of my thesis
on indigenous rights.
Are you a descendant?
Not unless Tonto had a rabbi
I don't know about.
<i>Here.</i>
Some of my research
on Mike and <i>A.C.M.</i>
- Might help you track him down.
- You think the company would try to kill him?
Well, it would shut up
their loudest protestor.
Thank you very much.
Jarod, that picture-
- Who is the older guy?
- Pretty sure he's my father.
- Pretty sure?
- When I was a boy, l-
I was told that my parents
were killed in a plane crash.
It was a lie.
Man. Who'd make up
a lie like that?
The Centre has another project
for you, Jarod.
This technique hasn't
been used for decades.
How can you improve it?
By factoring in tissue depth
from living people...
I can re-create a face
more accurately.
By size and weight, l-
I would say he is a man.
[Young Sydney]
Very good.
- Was he someone's father?
- Jarod.
Yesterday was a year, Sydney.
- Since the crash.
- Focus... on the work.
This technique is promising.
I wish I could invent
a way to bring him back.
<i>[Mike] I want to tell you everything about</i>
<i>your father and his dream quest.</i>
[Engine Starts]
[Engine Starts]
You're a bounty hunter?
Not anymore.
- What happened at your house?
- Guy came in blasting.
- Did you see him?
- He must have been waiting for me.
As soon as he started
shooting, I ran.
But not before I grabbed
that picture of your father.
[Groans]
That could be infected.
I'm staying in a motel up the highway.
Let's get you there, and I'll fix you up.
<i>Come on.
That's not right.
I owe you.
- Why do you keep saying that?
- Your father saved my life.
<i>I need to tell you about him</i>
<i>and his dream quest.</i>
You want answers?
Jarod, I got 'em.
<i>Come on.
- Freeze!
- Kim, no!
Two words, Jarod!
"Hand cuffs"!
You are so focused on the money,
you don't even care that the man is injured!
Doesn't look that hurt to me.
- I think a bounty hunter is tryin' to kill him.
- Tell it to the judge.
If he lives that long.
Where'd you get that?
Gift shop up the highway.
<i>[Jarod On Phone]</i>
<i>After three years of searching, I finally feel close.</i>
What about Fenigor's
last words?
Your father may be a killer.
<i>Is that something</i>
<i>you can accept?</i>
Unless it's another
<i>Centre lie.
Has any of your eyesight
returned since the bombing?
Infirmary says, uh,
there's no nerve damage, but I still can't see.
Maybe you don't want to.
I don't know who I am...
or where I came from...
or if my father murdered
a woman in cold blood...
but I'll take
what I can get.
Truth isn't easy...
but it's real.
- It opens your eyes.
- [Beep]
[Dial Tone, Beeps]
I ask for Fenigor's body,
you bring his sheets?
It was either that
or a bedpan.
<i>Perhaps Angelo's</i>
<i>empathic abilities...</i>
- <i>can give us some direction.</i>
- The blind leading the blind.
Revenge bad.
Revenge makes revenge
makes revenge.
This isn't about me.
Mr. F-Fenigor better now.
Is he alive?
Where is he?
What's going on, Broots?
- <i>What is Angelo up to?</i>
- <i>[Broots] Well, he's, uh...</i>
put the sheet over his head.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Fenigor is a ghost.</i>
Ghosts aren't alive, Sydney.
At the Centre they are.
<i>And where do they live</i>
<i>these days?</i>
Renewal Wing.
<i>"C, " "A''....</i>
five, four, three.
<i>"C, " "A''....</i>
- <i>five, four, three.</i>
- "C," "A"...
five, four, three.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Thank you, Angelo.</i>
It must be bounty hunter
breakfast break.
A man's gotta eat, Vincent.
I never start a day
without pigs in a blanket.
- Pigs in the who?
- Blanket.
Have a nice day.
The bartender
at Dunson's...
told me Mike
was there yesterday.
Said a bounty hunter showed up
and shot the place up.
Is that so?
- Said Mike was shot too.
- Really?
I wouldn't put it
past you animals.
From what I hear, it's the mining company
that wants Mike dead.
Well, you just tell your friends
this ain't the Wild West.
<i>That's why I got paperwork</i>
<i>on you people.</i>
These are all the registered
bounty hunters?
Yes. Please don't tell Vincent
about this. He'd kill me.
It's between us.
Jarod, I was thinking about
that picture of your dad.
I scoped out back issues
of the tribal paper.
This is from the mid-'70s.
Mike was lost in the desert,
so they mounted this huge rescue effort.
The find was credited to an ex-air force major
who volunteered for the search.
- Is his name in here anywhere?
- No, but he saved Mike's life.
Why are you doing this?
You know, every man
should know who his father is.
[Young Sydney] Your facial reconstruction
techniques are quite impressive, Jarod.
- What's that?
- My father.
<i>I sculpted him too, Sydney.</i>
- <i>[Young Sydney] He doesn't have a face.</i>
- I can't see my father, Sydney.
I don't know who he really is.
[Whispers] Oh, you're gonna get shot
creepin' around like that!
You think I want to be
down here?
Angelo started mumbling
something after you left.
Something about CA543.
- Centre Archives?
- Yes. It's a reference number
for an archive receptacle.
<i>[Motor Whirring]</i>
Lost.
Nice pajamas.
If Angelo says there's something
in the archives, go get it.
<i>[Humming]</i>
- <i>[Miss Parker] Broots.</i>
- [Humming Continues]
So nice to have visitors.
Mr. Fenigor.
- Dad?
- Dad?
Is that you?
Is that you?
I can't see my father, Sydney.
I don't know who he really is.
[Screams]
<i>[Banging]</i>
[Groaning]
You said motel by the highway.
- Hard man to find.
- Mike.
- [Groaning]
- Mike.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Don't you remember me?</i>
- Can't say that I do.
- Mr. Fenigor, my mother is Catherine Parker.
- Who?
- You were helping her...
<i>rescue children</i>
<i>from the Centre.</i>
Rescue? The Centre's
mission statement clearly says...
that our fellow man
is our highest priority.
Jarod's father killed my mother.
That's what you said.
I don't know anyJarod.
Sorry.
I hope you find
what you're looking for.
- <i>Somebody scrambled his brain.</i>
- Like an egg.
Huh. Why wouldn't they
just kill him?
- I mean, they did it to-
- To my mother?
Okay. L-
It's a really bad analogy,
but think about it.
I mean, why wouldn't they
just get rid of him?
Maybe somebody wants me down here looking
for Fenigor, running into dead ends.
- Mr. Lyle.
- It would give him a jump start on catching Jarod.
Does he know about
this archive receptacle?
- No. Angelo only told me and Sydney.
- Find it, and bring it to me.
Buckshot. You're lucky.
I didn't bomb that mining rig.
Then why did you jump bail?
Do you know- Do you know how many times
A.C.M.'s had me arrested?
I always skip a court appearance
just to get theirJockeys in a bunch.
Gotta be vocal,
defend my land.
I'm the last in my line, Jarod.
I die, the tribe gets it.
<i>Cute.
Why don't you take me in?
I'm a valuable warrior.
I'll take my past instead.
<i>[Banging]</i>
I knew that dream catcher
looked familiar.
<i>I played a hunch, Delaware.</i>
I figured if I followed you
instead of Mike, he'd show up.
Good hunch.
- [Groans]
- You can't just take him in.
Yes, I can.
[Grunts]
- No, you can't.
- Ow!
Two words: "hand cuffs."
<i>Every bounty hunter in</i>
<i>the state will be after us now.</i>
I'm better when I'm hunted.
Hey! That's my...
car.
<i>[Miss Parker] Anything on</i>
<i>theJarod Web site front?</i>
Just that you were right.
It was a dead end.
Oh, if anything comes up,
you'll be the first to know.
- I'm sure I will.
- Any luck on the revenge front?
You too will be the first to know.
Where's Helen Keller?
Physician, heal thyself?
Therapy, Miss Parker.
Face the truth about what you've done.
In my case, misguided vengeance.
Turn your eyes
to something positive...
something worth seeing.
Does it work?
You're blurry.
But you're there.
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>my revenge is misguided?</i>
If you have to ask...
you're answering
your own question.
<i>No offense, Syd, but you can't</i>
<i>see it from where I stand.</i>
<i>But I don't have to.</i>
I've known you since you were
a little girl, Parker.
<i>You will never let this go.</i>
<i>But I want to help.</i>
Like him. You're worth it.
Where's my mom and dad?
<i>[Mike]</i>
<i>You're a good man, Jarod.</i>
- Just like your father.
- What was he like?
He would only say
his name was Major Charles.
But I gave him a better one.
Soaring Eagle.
- Did he live around here?
- No. He trained at Clearview Air Base years before.
So he knew the terrain.
Just like he knew about
losing a son.
<i>I heard about the search</i>
<i>for you when you were a boy.</i>
I wanted to be a big warrior,
go on a quest.
I wandered into the caves
and broke my arm.
Your dad led the search for me. After five days
they stopped lookin', but your father-
He wouldn't give up.
My father kept on searching.
Alone.
He said it was like
finding his own son.
Like finding you.
As a reward, my father taught yours
to make his own dream catcher...
sent him to the caves
on his own quest.
Is the cave still out there?
Just like he left it.
<i>They say you can find things there.</i>
<i>Answers to questions that are in here.</i>
- That's what he did.
- <i>[Shotgun Blasts]</i>
Get down!
- Are you hit?
- Yeah, but I'm not bleeding.
- Rubber bullets.
- That cowboy's not so tough.
Or he wasn't hired
to kill you.
I found it, Miss Parker,
but I don't know what it means.
Why would they have
an archive receptacle on your mom?
L-
I didn't-
I mean, I couldn't.
I wouldn't open it.
It's, um-
Well, it's not my place.
<i>I'm leaving.</i>
<i>Here I go.</i>
<i>I'm leaving.</i>
<i>Here I go.</i>
- Broots.
- Yeah.
Thanks.
<i>Mama! Mama, please, no! Mama!</i>
<i>[Lid Closes]</i>
<i>[Jarod] If the bounty hunters don't want you dead,</i>
<i>then somebody else does.</i>
The question is why. All of this land
was sold to the mining company by the tribe?
Except my land.
They don't own it.
- But if you die, the tribe gets your land.
- Doesn't make sense.
If the tribe sells my land,
who benefits?
The man who makes it happen.
- Vincent.
- As tribal liaison...
he arranges
land buys for <i>A.C.M.</i>
<i>Vincent's stock portfolio.</i>
After every land deal,
he gets more stock options.
<i>Couldn't sell your land, and he can't cash in</i>
<i>the options until he completes the pie.</i>
Guess killing you
is the only answer.
The bounty hunters
take the blame.
How much?
<i>[Keyboard Clacking]</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>$250,000.</i>
Talk about making a killing.
Jarod.
That's a mighty big gun
you've got.
Don't leave home
without it.
I'll have to
remember that.
[Mimics Gunshot]
- [Mimics Gunshot]
- <i>[Jarod] Kim. It's Delaware.</i>
<i>I've got something</i>
<i>to show you.</i>
[Rings]
- Yeah.
- I've gotta talk to you, Vincent.
- What the hell is it? I'm eating.
- Sorry.
Listen. I was working late, and Mike Bodie
showed up. He's furious.
He's looking at maps
and computer files and stuff.
L- I'll be right over.
<i>[Electronic Twittering]</i>
[Keyboard Clacking]
- Damn it!
- [Hammer Cocks]
<i>Aw. Your money's all gone.</i>
<i>Better call your broker.</i>
The Man With No Name.
Were you expecting
someone else?
Mike Bodie maybe?
<i>Well, I'm just guessing,</i>
<i>of course.</i>
Takin' a shot in the dark.
<i>[Vincent Panting]</i>
[Grunting]
<i>How's it feel, Vincent?</i>
To be unarmed.
- What the hell are you doin'?
- I'm goin' huntin'!
What about you?
You got the wrong bounty!
Oh, you should know,
'cause you were a bounty hunter...
the night you tried to
kill Mike Bodie!
Mike jumped bail!
On what charge?
Blowing up an <i>A.C.M.</i> Rig?
<i>It was empty, Vincent.</i>
<i>And I'll bet your stock options</i>
<i>that you set the explosion yourself.</i>
<i>You had to have Mike's land.</i>
<i>And you knew he had</i>
<i>a habit ofjumpin'bail.</i>
So you tried to gun him down.
And you figured that the bounty hunters
would take the blame.
You sold out your own people.
That's right, Jarod.
<i>And I blew up the rig.</i>
And I tried to kill Mike.
And now you're
out of shells, cowboy.
[Click]
<i>And you're out ofluck.</i>
Knew we'd make a great team.

<i>Couldn't have put it

Lead the way.
I was told something
about my father.
<i>Something evil.</i>
What kind of man was he?
He saved my life.
<i>[Mike] Your father's.</i>
<i>No one has been in this cave since he left.</i>
- What are these?
- <i>Visions from your father's quest.</i>
<i>The eagle. It's always above us.</i>
<i>Always searching.</i>
<i>This eagle is searching</i>
<i>for his son.</i>
Our symbol for eternity.
<i>He will never</i>
<i>give up his search.</i>
These are my father's dreams.
<i>[Mike]</i>
<i>Or nightmares.</i>
<i>Circle of fire.

- Ask him yourself.
You're on your own.

<i>[Jarod, Echoing]</i>
<i>Dad?</i>

There's something

- The story of my life.
But you can't have
a dead end without a road.
<i>And thanks to you,</i>
<i>I have a new one to follow.</i>
- So, what are you gonna do?
- I'm going to follow the circle.

- <i>We'll have more as this story unfolds.</i>
<i>Now, Paul, back to you in the studio.</i>
We need your help.
Something terrible has happened.
A girl has been kidnapped.
You need to find her.
<i>[Police Radio, Indistinct]</i>
- Excuse me, Lieutenant Fawkes?
- Who's he?
Special agent
from theJustice Department.
<i>I can't, Sydney.</i>
<i>I'm scared.</i>
- You wanna help Annie, don't you?
- Sydney, no. I'm too scared.
- Put your fear away.
- But, Sydney, I can't!
You have to, Jarod.
You're the only one who can save her.
<i>[Young Sydney]Jarod,</i>
<i>you're the only one who can save her.</i>
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's</i>
<i>already demonstrating more</i>
<i>talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
<i>That's funny. I don't remember</i>
<i>calling in theJustice Department.</i>
Jarod Ressler.
- I'm a criminal behaviorist. I'm here to help.
- Go back to Washington.
We have enough <i>cops</i>
handling a kidnapping.
You won't be receiving
a ransom note, Detective.
- Lieutenant.
- Look, the man that took Sarah is a killer.
So every minute that we stand here arguing
is a minute closer to her death.
- He's taunting you.
- You think?
He cuts the eyes out.
It makes him believe he's invisible.
And these curtains,
he left them open on purpose.
Look again, Kreskin.
They're closed. They've been closed.
<i>Actually, Lieutenant, they were open.</i>
<i>I shut them to keep the news cameras out.</i>
[Sighs]
Talk.
I've seen this M.O. Before.
A series of crimes committed
by a man named Douglas Willard.
- Maxwell, A.P.B. This Willard.
- Don't bother.
He's been in prison for the last 20 years.
<i>[Broots] Looks like the lights are on,</i>
<i>but no one's home.</i>
- Jarod's life story.
- Clearly, he was here.
<i>He was training</i>
<i>for something aquatic.</i>
Syd, Wonder Boy ever say
he wanted to be Mr. Limpet?
Not that I recall.
<i>You know, when I was a kid,</i>
<i>I always wanted to be Aquaman.</i>
You know?
Human gills and a-
Sorry.
Hey, look.
Looks like we might be
going to Florida.
- Looks like he did.
- That's too easy.
<i>Look at all these things</i>
<i>he left behind.</i>
<i>Something unexpected</i>
<i>must have come up...</i>
and Jarod left before he planned.
The question is, where is he?
The question is, where is he?
Doug Willard, a.k.a.
The "Blue Moon Killer."
He made a series of abductions along
the upper east coast in the mid-'70s.
All young women snatched
from their bedrooms.
Eyeless dolls left behind,
along with the words...
"blue moon rising."
- If Willard's in maximum security-
- We're dealing with a copycat.
- Why "blue moon"?
- It's the second full moon of a calendar month.
<i>Willard killed his victims</i>
<i>at midnight of the blue moon.</i>
It says here police got
an anonymous tip out of Delaware...
<i>that helped them catch Willard...</i>
<i>but not before</i>
<i>he murdered his last victim.</i>
Her name was Annie.
Her body was never found.
Here she is.
Jarod, you did everything you could.
It's not your fault.
She died because of me, Sydney.
I let her die.
<i>[Fawkes]</i>
<i>If they never found her...</i>
how could they be sure?
Willard sent a photo of
her body to her parents.
- It arrived the day after he was arrested.
- Sick bastard.
- Where do we start?
- We find the copycat.
Now, he's meticulously recreating
every detail of Willard's M.O.
Details that weren't in the papers...
which means that he had
some kind of contact with Willard.
- An old cell mate?
- No, Willard's been in isolation since day one.
<i>No family, no visiting privileges.</i>
Do a rundown of all
the prison personnel.
- <i>Guards, doctors, public defenders, anyone.</i>
- I'm on it.
<i>What would it take to get</i>
<i>Willard transferred here?</i>
A damn good reason, for starters.
How about someone is trying
to become Willard?
I need to pick the brain
of the real thing.
- Do your picking at McCallister.
- I need him here where
I can have access to him.
- I can't do that for you.
- The night after tomorrow is a blue moon.
If we don't stop it,
another girl is going to die.
<i>Sydney, are those her parents?</i>
- [Sobbing]
- <i>[Sydney] Yes.</i>
<i>And they're counting on you</i>
<i>to find their daughter.</i>
[Sobbing]
<i>[Prisoners Yelling, Shouting]</i>
The more I learn about this guy,
the sicker my gut feels.
The path to the man that kidnapped Sarah
is Douglas Willard.
I hope you're right.
I just got off the phone with McCallister.
Willard's in transit.
He'll be here ASAP.
- You owe me.
- Big-time.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>You know, Syd, sometimes I think...</i>
you and I are the only people
around here that are sane...
which isn't saying much for me.
<i>What's wrong?</i>
You've got that
"just eaten in the cafeteria" look.
I'm sorry.
I'm fine.
Well, I'm not.
Raines has convinced Daddy
I should go down to Florida afterJarod...
even though I made it clear
it's pointless.
Raines had nothing to do with it.
<i>I convinced your father.</i>
Didn't we agree at the wharf
Jarod wasn't headed to Florida?
Maybe I was wrong.
- Maybe we overlooked something.
- Cancel what I said earlier.
- I'm the only sane one around here.
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
Oh.
Jarod?
- [Jarod] How did you know?
- Annie told me.
This time it's a girl named Sarah.
I can't let it happen again.
You caught her killer.
You saved countless others.
But I couldn't save Annie.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>None of us can change the past, Jarod.</i>
You did everything you could.
You must get over it.
Willard gets transferred here
in the morning.
Sydney...
I've never seen him face-to-face.
But running away
will offer no solace.
You know what you have to do.
Jarod. Jarod!
- I want to be alone with him.
- Bad idea.
The psychiatrist at McCallister calls Willard
an earwig. You give him half a chance...
he'll crawl into your head
and chew on your brain.
He's left two suicides and half a dozen
psych discharges in his wake.
- I'm not afraid of much, but I'm scared of him.
- So am I.
Jarod!
And who might you be,
little boy?
- I hopeJarod knows what he's doing.
- [Willard] I owe you a thanks.
For what?
Twenty years in solitary,
this is like a vacation.
- I didn't do it for you.
- Then why?
We'll get to that.
Nice accommodations.
<i>Of course, I'm used to</i>
<i>a little bit more privacy.</i>
Smart-ass.
- Who are you?
- I'm Jarod Ressler.
- I'm with theJustice Department.
- Justice?
I never realized I was so important.
You're not.
Just what is it you want?
I'm a criminal behaviorist.
You're a case study.
Interviewing you would
broaden my knowledge.
Why do I get the feeling you're lying?
And why do I find it shocking
that you have feelings?
Touché.
The way I was abruptly jerked
from my peaceful abode and rushed here...
makes me think that
my presence was urgently needed.
It's almost as if it was
a matter of life and death.
Now the feds are involved.
That narrows down the list
of possible crimes, doesn't it?
I doubt if I was pulled in
for a terrorist bombing.
It's not really my specialty.
No, I'm gonna take a wild guess and say-
[Inhales]
Abduction.
Still, there must be a reason why
you chose me, why I was selected...
and that's the easiest one of all.
I'm on pins and needles.
Tomorrow night is a blue moon...
and that leaves us
with one conclusion.
There's somebody else out there.
Someone like me.
I'm impressed.
And you want my help?
Yes, I do.
Well, as they say,
hell will freeze first.
Well, I am very sorry
to have disturbed you.
I'll make sure they
take you back to your...
peaceful abode.
<i>[Knocking]</i>
<i>[Clanging]</i>
<i>[Door Closes]</i>
That's it? Three minutes, he shuts you down,
and you just walk away?
Patience.
I worked like hell
to get that guy here!
Ressler! It's not as if
I have somewhere else to be.
<i>[Miss Parker] We burn half a day in</i>
<i>the Sunshine State, sniffing trails going nowhere.</i>
A standard cleanup crew
could have checked that out.
The question is, why were we sent?
And what's Sydney got to do with it?
Sydney wouldn't just
send us to waste our time.
- Unless he wanted us gone.
- What?
I saw him staring
at a photo in his office.
I bet answers are there.
I bet answers are there.
Yesterday, a young woman was taken.
This young woman.
Every detail of the crime
was identical to yours.
Well, let me guess.
You're looking for a white male,
22-35, unmarried, a loner.
His neighbors are amazed and say,
"He was a quiet man."
I know the standard profile.
I need more, and there's little time.
If I give you what you need,
will you give me what I need?
I already got you out of your hole,
which means you owe me.
<i>Now, the copycat is</i>
<i>re-creating your last abduction...</i>
which means he's going to take his victim
to the last place that you took yours.
Oh, Annie.
They never found her, you know.
<i>It'll be the same with the new one</i>
<i>if the copycat is as smart as I am.</i>
<i>And how does it feel to be</i>
<i>the smartest man on the planet?</i>
Lonely.
<i>Clearly, law enforcement has not raised</i>
<i>its standards in the last 20 years.</i>
They're still the same stupid people that
bungled their way through my capture.
- But they did catch you.
- Not in time.
<i>Besides, "they"didn't catch me.</i>
As I sat in my hole,
I studied those...
who were supposedly responsible
for bringing me to justice.
I knew them better
than they knew their wives.
And?
They couldn't catch a cold.
They got a lucky break
from a very gifted informant.
How do you know he was gifted?
Maybe he was just lucky.
'Cause I'm smarter than that.
He had to be really gifted.
A genius.
He was the worthiest adversary
I've ever had.
I was denied the opportunity to meet him.
It was so disappointing.
You see, I got inside
my victims' heads.
I knew where they lived,
how they thought, how they act.
To know someone,
you've got to get inside them.
See, that's what I wanted to ask the anonymous
informant. For 20 years, I wondered-
How did he get inside me?
Do you know this man, Agent?
No.
Well, I only ask
because I was wondering...
if he was as lonely
on this planet as I am.
Well, like you said...
being smart gets lonely sometimes.
Now, where is this copycat
going to take her?
You said it already.
Same place I took Annie.
- Where?
- <i>We've got till tomorrow midnight.</i>
- Tell me!
- Oh, I can't do that. You'd send me back.
Answer me! Where is he going to take her?
Where did you take Annie?
Relax, Ressler.
<i>Come on.
If you don't control your emotions,
you're never gonna find him, are you?
<i>[Young Jarod] No, Sydney!</i>
<i>Don't make me do it! I'm scared!</i>
Time's running out, Jarod.
It's the only way we're gonna find her.
No, please!
Please, no!
[Sobbing]
<i>Angelo, I've got something</i>
<i>I want you to look at.</i>
Miss Parker, I don't like the idea
of stealing from Sydney.
<i>We're not stealing.</i>
<i>We'rejust looking at it.</i>
Angelo, tell me about her.
Who is she?
She's-
She's scared.
Annie.
Tell me about Annie.
- We want to go home.
- <i>[Clanging]</i>
<i>You were told to go to Florida.</i>
Been there, done that.
Waste of time.
A complete dry hole?
- There were a few bread crumbs.
- Then why are you here?
'Cause they were leading nowhere.
Sydney, you wanna clue him in?
- Florida's a boondoggle.
- It's still our best chance at finding Jarod.
Get back down there.
<i>[Wheels Squeaking]</i>
Geez, I just got done unpacking.
We're not going anywhere, Broots.
- They said we had to go back down.
- And I said we're not.
<i>Those two are up to something.</i>
I wanna know everything that
there is to know about her.
This is the bread crumb to follow.
[Sobbing]
<i>Anything on prison personnel</i>
<i>tied to Willard?</i>
- Workin' on it.
- Hurry up. We're running out of time.
So are they.
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>I wanna meet Annie's parents.</i>
- If I talk to them, maybe l-
- That's impossible.
I don't want their emotions
to cloud your objectivity.
But why are they so upset?
Don't they have other children?
The emotions a parent and child share
are strong and fragile.
One child or 10,
each relationship is unique.
If threatened,
they all feel immense pain.
<i>[Woman Sobbing]</i>
I wonder if my parents
cried for me?
If you imagine hard enough,
it almost tastes like real coffee.
Thank you.
<i>[Mrs. Rickman]</i>
<i>Before she went to bed that night...</i>
I don't even remember
if I told her I loved her.
Mrs. Rickman,
Sarah knows you love her.
I just can't help but wonder
if everything is being done.
If there isn't something more.
You have a lust for power,
so be powerful.
- Save the girl.
- Careful, Agent.
Emotions cloud your eyes.
They make you vulnerable.
- They make you-
- Human?
You're a puzzle to me, Jarod.
<i>Your passion makes me think</i>
<i>there's more to you than meets the eye.</i>
- I want to find Sarah.
- I want something too. The truth.
- About what?
- I think you know.
<i>For 20 years,</i>
<i>I've obsessed about my capture.</i>
<i>I've read every piece of paper,</i>
<i>every file, every document.</i>
And during those 20 years, I found
nothing about an anonymous informant.
Well, that is the key word-
"anonymous."
<i>It must have been somebody</i>
<i>who knew me...</i>
somebody who studied me
as I study me.
You seem to know me well.
I read your file.
Oh, you know more about me
than is in my file.
You know who I really am.
And that makes me wonder
who you really are.
- What the hell is he doing?
- It seems you and I have a secret.
You were a child then.
A prodigy.
I heard the word used, yes.
- How did you know?
- I can see.
I can feel your loneliness.
A small child helps the police
capture a genius. Now, I am impressed.
I helped them capture a monster.
But it wasn't in time
to save Annie, was it?
It must be a terrible experience
for someone as human as you.
<i>It makes me wonder how it's all</i>
<i>gonna work out for little Sarah.</i>
<i>Like you said...</i>
time is running out.
<i>She's asleep when I enter.</i>
<i>They all are.</i>
I know because
I've been watching them.
Keep going, Jarod.
I wanna go to her, but l-I can't...
not while they're watching me.
I have to stop them
from watching me!
There! I'm invisible!
<i>Why open the curtains, Jarod?</i>
<i>You don't want to be seen.</i>
The moonlight.
I need to feel it shining on me.
- I can't go any further, Sydney.
- <i>Yes.</i>
Yes, you can, Jarod.
No. I don't wanna be inside his head.
- I don't wanna have him inside of mine.
- <i>You have to.</i>
- No, I can't!
- <i>It's the only way we're gonna find Annie.</i>
I can't, Sydney!
I don't wanna feel that!
I don't wanna feel that.
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
Detective Maxwell.
Yeah, give me the info.
- Why'd you pull the plug
on Willard's surveillance cam?
- Privacy.
- His or yours?
- I know what I'm doing.
You better.
He's asking for you.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Talk to me.</i>
- You'll have to be more specific.
- Raines wants me out of the way.
- You're singing backup. Why?
- You're beginning to sound paranoid.
Then this must be
one of my delusions.
What's happening again, and why doesn't
anybody want me to find out about it?
Parker, leave the stone unturned.
You know, for years I've wondered
who you really were.
But inside, I always knew.
Is your name reallyJarod?
Are you truly from
theJustice Department?
My name is Jarod.
You wanted to see me.
He'll hold her till the moon is full.
Until midnight.
- I already knew that.
- <i>Actually, you already know everything.</i>
You have all the answers.
You just won't do what you need to do.
Help me.
Why did I cut the eyes
out of the dolls?
- To make yourself invisible.
- Why open the curtains?
[Sighs]
To feel the moonlight on your body.
Why'd he do it?
- The same reason.
- <i>Where is he?</i>
- I don't know.
- <i>Where is she?</i>
- I don't know!
- Come on, prodigy.
Do what you need to do. You had
all the answers you needed to find Annie.
<i>I left them for you last time.</i>
<i>He left them for you this time.</i>
Get inside his head.
Get inside my head.
- No.
- Where is she?
[Sighs]
I don't know.
[Sighs]
You know, you've never asked me for
what I wanted, what I need to help you.
[Scoffs]
Oh, really?
Well, what do you need?
Take me to the crime scene.
Take me to Sarah's bedroom.
- And why would I wanna do that?
- Because I can feel it.
Because I can do what you won't do-
become him.
I don't wanna become him, Sydney!
They would never allow it.
You're a genius.
You'll figure it out.
Do it for Sarah.
Do it for Annie.
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
Ressler. We found the kidnapper.
<i>[Fawkes]</i>
<i>The kidnapper's name is Paul Schuman.</i>
<i>He was a guard at McCallister for six years.</i>
<i>Worked nights.</i>
<i>Assigned to solitary confinement</i>
<i>cell block and-</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Douglas Willard.</i>
- <i>[Fawkes] Oh, it gets better.</i>
- <i>Willard and Schuman developed</i>
<i>a continuing conversation.</i>
- It's clear.
<i>Eighteen months ago, Schuman</i>
<i>has a breakdown and vanishes.</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>All clear. Nobody's in here.</i>
Well, the acorn's gone,
but we found the right tree.
We've got less than eight hours
until the moon is full.
Look at this.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Sarah at home...</i>
<i>waiting for the school bus.</i>
[Chuckles]
He's even got her class schedule.
<i>Nantauk, New Bedford, Cape May.</i>
Schuman visited all the places
that Willard struck.
- Historical tour?
- Research trip.
<i>He's trying to get inside</i>
<i>of Willard's skin.</i>
<i>[Fawkes] By taking Sarah,</i>
<i>he's picking up where Willard left off.</i>
<i>Over here. Letters from Willard,</i>
<i>as recent as last week.</i>
- This is gibberish.
- Mm-mmm.
<i>Code, to get past
the prison censors.
Willard climbed into his head
and earwigged him.
The question is-
Is Schuman a copycat
or a puppet?
What's our next move?
We give Willard what he wants.
<i>[Willard]</i>
<i>Did you think about taking me with you?</i>
- Tell me about Carl Schuman.
- Answer me, I answer you.
He was your prison guard
before you got inside of his head.
He was an impressionable fan, Jarod.
Frankly, it's irrelevant at this point.
Like these letters you wrote to him?
<i>You were behind Sarah's abduction</i>
<i>from the very beginning.</i>
Schuman is just your eyes, your ears
and your legs out there, isn't he?
But now it's just you and me.
Déjŕ vu, Jarod.
It's like a snake
eating its own tail.
You're right back where you started-
a scared little boy.
You know who the killer is,
but you can't save the girl.
- At least, not alone.
- Where did he take Sarah?
Same place I took Annie.
[Sighs]
Tell me.
Do the right thing, Jarod.
Take me with you.
- We can still stop him.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
<i>He's not going anywhere.</i>
<i>Agent Ressler, I wanna talk to you.</i>
What the hell is this?
I know it sounds crazy, but if
I could take Willard to the crime scene-
- <i>Request denied.</i>
- <i>A girl's life is at risk.</i>
And risking more by letting that loose
isn't the answer. Request denied.
- Look, I know it's-
- No!
You know, at first I thought
you knew what you were doing.
- Now I think he's earwigged you.
- <i>[Paper Crumpling]</i>
You're out of here.
Get in.
Ressler, what the hell are you doing?
- I'm ending this once and for all.
- I don't see any authorization.
- Stay out of my way, Maxwell.
- I can't let you do this.
No more time to waste.
<i>No more time.</i>
Such a display of violence, prodigy.
<i>[Willard]</i>
<i>Mmm. Can you smell it?</i>
Death.
It's amazing how little girls' rooms
are the same wherever you go.
Tell me where she is.
You know, Jarod, I can't do
my best work under these conditions.
If you set me free; well,
then I'll set you free.
- <i>[Handcuffs Ratcheting]</i>
- If you so much as sneeze, I end this.
If you close your eyes...
you can almost hear
the sounds of her muffled cries.
She's sleeping as he cracks the door
and slips inside.
[Coughs]
She has a summer cold.
Her breathing is
heavier than normal.
He kinda likes that.
And then?
He notices the eyes.
He can't leave witnesses.
He sits on the bed.
He watches her.
[Sniffing]
Oh, he can smell the soft scent
of... sweet powder.
And what is that?
Shampoo.
Then what?
You tell me.
- No.
- Tell me!
I don't wanna become him, Sydney!
I don't want him to be inside me!
What does he do next, Jarod?
He wants to scream...
because it feels so good...
so right.
He takes her down
the hallway, doesn't he?
Past her parents' bedroom.
He pauses.
They're asleep.
They look so...
innocent...
so unaware.
Where does he take her next, Jarod?
- I don't know.
- Feel it.
The moon is full.
It's almost midnight.
Look, I took you
where you wanted to go.
Now just tell me where she is.
It must be frustrating to be so close,
and yet so far away.
Tell me!
Tell me where she is!
- Tell me!
- Follow the clues.
- Do what you have to do!
- I don't know! Now tell me where she is!
It's so obvious.
Why can't I figure it out?
Why doesn't it make any sense?
Because it's all a lie.
There is no rhyme or reason
to any of this, Jarod.
There is no midnights,
no blue moons rising.
It's all meaningless.
The truth is...
I killed them
because I wanted to.
I like it.
Now it's time
for me to see Sarah.
I expected a much more
worthy adversary, prodigy.
Good-bye, Jarod.
It's time for the monster
to leave now.
- What'd you get on the girl?
- Ah, there wasn't a lot.
Not even a last name. I mean, there's
absolutely no reference to her last name.
- <i>It's-It's weird.</i>
- Broots, don't waste my time
telling me what you didn't find.
Okay.
All I could find is that...
she was kidnapped and murdered
23 years ago...
<i>and there's not even</i>
<i>a body been found.</i>
Where did this happen?
Uh, about 40 miles from here,
a place called Snow Hill, Maryland.
<i>Snow Hill?</i>
"Snow Hill."
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>And who might you be, little boy?</i>
Well, if it isn't
the young prodigy.
How does it feel...
to be the smartest man
on the planet?
Lonely.
It's time to go back to your hole.
You found me, Jarod.
But once again...
not in time to save the little girl.
Not this time.
<i>You see, a request to visit</i>
<i>the girl's bedroom was a ploy.</i>
So was my taking you there.
I followed you here.
Actually, I was one step ahead of you.
<i>We all were.</i>
<i>Carl Schuman never got near this place.</i>
Prodigy, you got inside my head.
No.
You don't have to become a monster...
to face one.
[Whimpering]
Help.
She's over here.
It's okay.
We're here to help <i>you.</i> Come on.
It's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
Nobody's gonna hurt you anymore.
- Get her out of here.
- It's okay, Sarah.
<i>Come on.
You'll be okay.
<i>Agent Ressler?</i>
<i>[Siren Wailing]</i>
It's time for you
to go home too, Annie.
I'm looking for this man.
- Special Agent Ressler?
- "Special Agent." Right.
- Where is he?
- He's right over- right over there.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>You saved her, Jarod.</i>
I wish I could have done
the same for Annie...
for her parents.
I know you tried.
I hope that finally
being able to bury her...
will bring them some kind of peace.
I'm sure it will.
I gave her father the locket.
I know he'd like me to thank you.
<i>[Beeps]</i>
I'm sorry.
I'm so very sorry.
[Sobbing]
You let me run all over the country
instead of telling me the truth.
He wanted it that way.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>I don't get it.</i>
<i>Sometimes, even the devil</i>
<i>deserves a little privacy.</i>
- <i>Do you remember what I told you?</i>
<i>Do you remember?</i>
- Just a little bit of help.
<i>I warned you to</i>
<i>stay clear of this place.</i>
I'll do anything that you need done.
<i>I just need something to eat.</i>
Not for me- for my child.
<i>I told you. This isn't a halfway house.</i>
- Is there a problem here, Manny?
- Oh, I didn't see you, <i>Mrs. -
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Is this man disrupting business?</i>
Well, he keeps coming in
asking if there's any work.
- Give him my table.
- Excuse me?
- <i>Treat him and his family</i>
<i>the same as any other patron.</i>
- <i>But, Mrs. -
When his family has finished eating,
pack a picnic basket...
and give them enough cash
for a hotel room for a week.
- Do you have a problem with that?
- No, ma'am.
- It's all right to go get your family now.
- God bless you.
Dignity is usually
something you see taken...
not given.
Family is the most important thing
a person can protect.
It's all there is.
You're not from Clear Bay.
No, I'm-I'm not.
Pleasure trip?
Business.
Well, I hope you enjoy your stay.
I, uh-
I didn't get your name.
Your résumé is impressive.
- Flawed, but impressive.
- Flawed?
The job you did in Seattle
almost landed you in jail.
Well, I'm here, aren't I?
Mr. Kincade needs
a consummate professional.
If he is even slightly associated
with incendiary events...
other arrangements
will have to be made.
- Try English.
- How do we know you're any good?
You see that 18-footer
at the end of the dock?
- <i>Yes.</i>
- It belongs to the local sheriff, I believe.
Yes. Randall Carver.
That's him over there.
- <i>He lives for that boat.</i>
- Not anymore.
<i>[Explosion]</i>
That's my-That's my boat!
<i>[People Screaming, Gasping]</i>
<i>So, we in business?</i>
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already</i>
<i>demonstrating more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
Anybody here?
[Sniffles]
Miss Parker.
- What's going on?
- I was just, uh, catching up on the pursuit files.
<i>I guess I'll... get back to work.</i>
Excuse me.
- Here it comes. Here it comes.
- [Groaning]
The second child is a boy.
It's stillborn.
<i>Harold Kincade.</i>
<i>Thanks for coming, Mr. Burns.</i>
<i>The Venus butterfly.</i>
<i>They say if she lands on you...</i>
some crap about good luck.
Well, luck didn't help
this one very much.
<i>You got that right. I heard about</i>
<i>your show at the marina this morning.</i>
- Fourth ofJuly stuff.
- Well, Sheriff Carver's not celebrating.
The preliminary investigation
ruled the explosion accidental.
That's the idea.
<i>Clean, professional.
I wouldn't want anything to happen
like what happened last time.
Last time?
I read the papers.
I know all about how
those people died in your building.
<i>It was an amateurish job.</i>
Just the kind of mess I don't need.
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Harold?</i>
<i>[Kincade] I thought you were spending</i>
<i>the afternoon in town.</i>
I wanted to surprise you.
I had Doris fix us an early dinner.
- No time.
- <i>Well, I'm sure she can-</i>
<i>Manny told me you created quite a scene</i>
<i>this morning with a homeless man.</i>
It was more than just
a homeless man.
He had a little girl who looked like
she hadn't had a decent meal in weeks.
My wife's a sucker for the lazy
and unmotivated, Mr. Burns.
Jarod.
Jarod's a designer.
I thought I'd give him a shot
at the building downtown.
<i>Could you recommend
a place to stay?
I'm afraid it's peak season.
There's not gonna be much available in town.
Well, the guesthouse is empty.
I couldn't possibly
put anybody out.
My husband is a sucker for
the aggressive and industrious.
<i>I'll have the housekeeper open it for you.</i>
<i>We'll talk in the morning.</i>
Don't wait up.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>I swear he was crying.</i>
He was watching
his own birth, Parker.
Seeing yourself ripped away from family
is enough to tear anyone's heart out.
Since when does Lyle have a heart?
Why is it so hard for you to believe
he might actually feel loss?
After all,
<i>Catherine was his mother too.
She may have given him life,
but she had nothing to do with who he is.
People change, Parker.
<i>Call it an awakening.
Sydney, we're talking about
a man who killed in cold blood.
- You don't "awaken" from that.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
Miss Parker,
this was just delivered for you.
Looks likeJarod's handwriting.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Oh, she's pretty.</i>
"Trust can kill you or set you free."
I've heard that somewhere before.
<i>It sounds kind of cryptic.</i>
Jarod wouldn't have
sent this without a reason.
Find out who she is.
Sure.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I grew up a long way away from here.</i>
- That makes two of us.
- Really?
I imagined you as a little girl
with a pony and private schools...
leading this charmed life
like Alice in Wonderland.
My parents died in a fire
when I was a baby.
I was raised by my aunt in a little
trailer park just west of Corpus Christi.
That must have been
very difficult for you.
She loved me. That's the last time
I remember being truly happy.
And you?
Do you have family?
I have a sister out there somewhere.
- My brother was killed about six months ago.
- I'm sorry.
- Your parents?
- I lost contact with them when I was a child.
I'm still trying to find them.
You should never give up.
The thing you want most in life
could be right around the next corner.
I know you're not
who you pretend to be.
I used to deny it,
but I know what my husband does.
You're not here
to design a building.
You're here to burn one down.
That's not... really who I am.
I believe you, Jarod.
You're a good man.
I can see it in your eyes.
My husband used to be
a good man.
Unfortunately, people change.
Good night.
Good night.
- Daddy?
- Ah, angel.
Did you, um, change your hair again?
Do you like it?
Well, it's your head.
[Chuckles]
Daddy, I need to talk
to you about Lyle.
I don't mean to sound paranoid,
but I think he's up to something.
- Did he threaten you?
- Threaten? No.
I caught him watching the D.S.A. Of my-
of-of our birth.
- So?
- So, he was crying.
Ah, I <i>see.</i> Crying.
And you took that for hostility?
Well, no.
But given his track record...
I thought it was kind of strange.
Now, sweetheart, Lyle's a very deep
and complicated man.
- But, Daddy-
- No, let me finish.
He came to me a few days ago
in confidence and, uh, purged his soul.
<i>I think you could say he's, uh,</i>
<i>undergoing a transformation.</i>
You know, he wanted to know
the location of your mother's grave.
<i>Can you imagine that?</i>
<i>Hmm.</i>
No, I can't.
Sweetheart, I know it's hard for you...
finding out about your brother
the way you did.
But it isn't easy
for him either, you know.
Just remember that.
And I do love your hair.
<i>[Jarod On Phone]</i>
<i>"Trust can kill you or set you free."</i>
So I've read.
<i>Who's the woman in the picture?</i>
<i>[Jarod] Someone who got caught up</i>
<i>with the wrong people.</i>
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Haven't we all?</i>
Some do worse things than others.
Like murdering an innocent woman
in an elevator?
So what are you trying to tell me?
That you have to see people
for what they are.
- Keep my eyes open.
- To all possibilities.
Because in the end...
we all get what we deserve.
<i>[Flames Crackling]</i>
<i>[Flames Crackling]</i>
<i>[Kristi Screaming]</i>
Oh, my God!
Jarod, help! It's Harold!
- Kristi, what happened?
- There was an explosion.
A fire. I couldn't get to him.
- Where's your husband?
- In the bedroom.
<i>Call 911!
- Stay here.
- He's my husband!
Stay here!
<i>[Woman On Radio]</i>
<i>Truck 89, tanker truck 289.</i>
<i>289, do you copy?</i>
- Make sure the fire inspector
has complete access to the bedroom.
- Right.
- Tape off the balcony.
- They still haven't found the source of the fire.
Sounds like my boat.
What a mess.
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather lie down?
I'm sorry to bother you, Ms. Kincade,
but I need to ask you some questions.
- Can't this wait?
- You the lawyer?
- Tom Byner's my lawyer. He's on his way.
- <i>I see.</i>
You wanna wait for him, or
do you wanna talk to me about this thing?
- What are you getting at, Sheriff?
- Who are you?
Mr. Burns is a business associate
of my husband. He's our guest.
- <i>What do you wanna know?</i>
- Everything you can remember.
I, uh, went to bed around 10:00.
Harold wasn't home yet.
He had a business meeting.
Um, I'd fallen asleep.
I remember Harold
climbing into bed.
I don't know what time it was
or how long it had been.
What happened next?
It's okay.
<i>[Kristi]</i>
<i>Um, I rolled over away from Harold...</i>
and I fell back asleep.
And at some point,
everything exploded.
I heard Harold scream,
and I turned, and he was on fire.
I reached out for him, but the flames were
too hot. There was nothing I could do.
So I ran down the stairs,
and I found Doris our housekeeper...
and that's when she told me
what she saw.
- What?
- A-A figure.
A man running across
the lawn into the woods.
That's all I remember.
I'm gonna have to ask you to come back
into town with me, Miss Kincade.
- What? Are you arresting her?
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>If everything checks out,</i>
<i>she oughta be home by morning.</i>
- <i>Sheriff, this is ridiculous.</i>
- She's been through enough already.
- <i>Mr. Burns.</i>
The housekeeper's statement takes you
away from the scene of the fire.
<i>But, uh, I would appreciate it</i>
<i>if you didn't leave town right away.</i>
- Beautiful girl.
- <i>Mmm.</i>
Her name is Che Ling.
That's what it says right here.
She's from the Xinjiang province, one of
the poorest regions of Northern China.
- Cut to the chase, Broots.
- Okay.
She applied for a visa 24 months ago.
She received it a year later.
- <i>And that's when she landed in neon city.</i>
- Vegas?
- Mm-hmm.
- Ring-a-ding-ding.
Yes. Las Vegas is
the marriage capital of the world.
- Marriage?
- Mm-hmm.
- See, Che Ling is a mail-order bride.
- [Sighs]
<i>Keep digging. L. V.P.D.,</i>
<i>county marriage records.</i>
- I want this girl.
- Okay.
<i>Men ordering women</i>
<i>like they were snow tires.</i>
Well, I'll give you a call later.
- You gonna be all right?
- Yes.
- Hi.
- Hi. Thank you for coming.
- Did Carver put you through the ringer?
- I've had better nights.
But I think he's satisfied,
at least for now.
I had your housekeeper prepare
a spare bedroom, so you can get some rest.
I can't go back to that house.
Not yet.
Well, where can I take you?
We have a cabin
just outside of town.
- Do you think you could drive me there?
- Of course.
<i>Come on.
<i>[Kristi]</i>
<i>Harold and I used to love this place...</i>
<i>especially in the early years.</i>
I don't wanna sound disrespectful...
but your husband didn't seem
to treat you very well.
He used to.
The man I loved and married was caring and
compassionate. He just didn't stay that way.
<i>Kristi, there's something</i>
<i>I wanna tell you.</i>
The real reason that
I came to Clear Bay was-
[Sniffing]
- What is it?
- <i>I think you have a cracked line.</i>
<i>Harold never could get</i>
<i>that gas leak fixed.</i>
<i>It seemed like every time the gas company</i>
<i>came out to fix one break...</i>
another one would spring up.
<i>I can shut off the main outside,</i>
<i>but you should really-</i>
really have that replaced.
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
Hello? Yes.
Yes, she is.
It's Tom Byner.
Thank you. Yes?
<i>No, Tom, I don't wanna talk about this.</i>
<i>No, I'll call you.</i>
- <i>What's wrong?</i>
- Byner wants to go over Harold's will.
- Now?
- Something about tax complications.
I don't know if
I can deal with this.
<i>I'm scared, Jarod.</i>
I can tell that the police think that
I had something to do with Harold's death.
- Why you?
- The estate is worth millions.
Your housekeeper saw someone
running from the house, right?
- What if they don't believe her?
- <i>I'll make them believe her.</i>
I'll prove to them that
someone else was there. Okay?
It's been so long since
someone's really taken care of me.
I'm-
I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
- No, it's-
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
It's strange to say good-bye
to someone you've never met.
<i>You can spend every waking hour...</i>
working your way to the top,
and then you get there...
and you realize that's
not even what it's all about.
Are you talking about her?
No. Me.
I've made a lot of mistakes
along the way.
I've made excuses for everything
I've done, and...
I can't-
I won't blame my past anymore.
I can't move forward
without a clean slate.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>She was very compassionate.</i>
I was never allowed
a first chance with her...
but I'd like a second one with you.
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Where did it all go wrong?</i>
Who are you, Mr. Burns?
I already told you.
I'm a designer.
And I'm Cindy Crawford.
The only thing that I'm guilty of
is bad timing.
- I doubt Mrs. Kincade would agree with that.
- Meaning?
She seems relieved to have
someone like you to lean on.
Mrs. Kincade is a very nice woman.
She's the prime suspect
in an active murder investigation.
She had nothing to do
with the death of her husband.
Maybe she didn't.
Maybe she did.
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave
the investigation to the police.
- A case like this could really
make a cop's career.
- What did you say?
<i>I'm wondering what</i>
<i>you're really interested in-</i>
justice or a conviction.
I'm interested in the truth.
And we'll find it.
<i>[Kristi's Voice]</i>
<i>Our housekeeper told me what she saw.</i>
A man running across
the lawn into the woods.
<i>They say the killer always</i>
<i>returns to the scene of the crime.</i>
It's times like this
I wish I hadn't quit smoking.
What's really bothering you?
Lyle is my brother,
and he seems sincere.
Oh, Sydney, I want to trust him.
It's just-
"Trust can kill you or set you free."
I remember who first
said that to me now.
- Confucius?
- Your mother.
<i>I just got this from</i>
<i>the Las Vegas Police Department.</i>
It's a 911 Che Ling made
the night she disappeared.
- Play it.
- [Woman] 911.
[Che Ling]
You have to help me. He will hurt me.
- Slow down. What's the problem?
- He angry.
He always angry. Going to hit me, beat me.
He coming back.
- Who is "he"? Your husband? Boyfriend?
- He coming.
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- <i>223 Desert Vista Apartments.</i>
- Please, he going to kill me.
- [Thud, Glass Breaking]
<i>When the police got there,</i>
<i>the apartment was empty.</i>
- Mail-order husband?
- Vanished. So was everything
connecting him to her.
<i>What about</i>
<i>a marriage certificate?</i>
There must be some way to find out
who she was so afraid of.
I contacted the license bureau. They couldn't
find any record of anyone named Che Ling.
It seems like everything about her
is disappearing right in front of our eyes.
This was just delivered
for you, Miss Parker.
Another present from Jarod.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Isn't that your father?</i>
- [Tape Rewinding]
- <i>[Woman] Where are you?</i>
<i>[Che Ling]</i>
<i>223 Desert Vista Apartments.</i>
<i>Please, he going to kill me.</i>
Desert Vista Apartments.
<i>You don't think it was your father</i>
<i>that Che Ling was so afraid of, do you?</i>
Where are you going?
To try and find someone to trust.
<i>You wanna tell me again</i>
<i>why you came to Clear Bay?</i>
I was on retainer to do
some work for Harold Kincade.
<i>Mm-hmm. Like the work you did</i>
<i>in Seattle a few years back?</i>
I did a background check on you, Burns.
You got a half a dozen arrests...
for arson.
I got a dead man, a suspicious fire
and a whole lot of attitude...
and it doesn't take a genius
to figure it out.
- Now why did you kill Kincade?
- I didn't.
- You were on the grounds.
- What about the boot prints?
- They're not my size.
- Easy for you to plant.
No, I want them
labeled as evidence.
Did Kincade cross you on the deal?
Try to rip you off? Is that why you torched him?
- Answer me!
- I'm not saying anything.
Which puts you right at the top
of the list in the murder of Harold Kincade.
- Not unless you have more than
a suspect rap sheet.
- Oh, gee.
- Tom, go away. This is police business.
- <i>Not anymore, it isn't.</i>
I've been retained by Kristi Kincade
to represent Mr. Burns in this matter.
- Kristi sent you?
- If you have proof of Mr. Burns's guilt,
charge him.
<i>Otherwise, I suggest you arrange</i>
<i>for his immediate release.</i>
Sheriff? What did Burns mean
when he asked about the boot prints?
You watched my interrogation?
I thought I could learn something.
Sheriff, you got a phone call.
They say it's an emergency.
Look, Deputy, why don't you
get back out on patrol, huh?
We don't want the system
to break down now, do we?
Hello?
Hello?
Jarod! I was so worried.
Oh!
When I heard you'd been taken in
by Sheriff Carver, I thought that-
It's okay now.
Everything's okay.
It's like a bad dream.
I'm here now.
[Clears Throat]
Yes, Doris?
Excuse me, Mrs. Kincade.
I think there's something you should see.
Will you excuse me?
Is everything all right?
I believed in you.
I thought I'd finally found
someone who I could trust.
What are you talking about?
- Lighter fluid, fuses, a timer.
- Where did you get this?
Did you think that killing him
was the only way for us to be together?
What? I had nothing to do
with the death of your husband.
- Then explain why Doris found
all this in the guest room.
- I don't know.
I trusted you!
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Don't- Let me go!
Not until you listen to me!
Now listen to me!
Yes, I wanted to see
your husband punished.
But after I met you,
everything changed.
I had nothing to do
with the death of your husband.
I could never do anything like that...
especially to someone like you.
You have to believe me.
<i>[Siren Wailing]</i>
Doris. She called the sheriff.
You gotta run.
- I've done nothing wrong.
- Carver has information
about you that says otherwise.
You gotta go.
Go to the cabin.
Wait for me until I come for you.
I'll call Byner and see
what we can do.
All right.
I'm innocent.
You have to believe me.
<i>[Elevator Bell Dings]</i>
- Can we talk?
- Nothing would make me happier.
There are things
I need to share with you.
I found a photograph.
I'm not sure what it means.
- Photograph?
- A picture of-
- Miss-Miss Parker?
- Not now.
I'm not sure what it means,
but I think it concerns us both.
It's imperative we speak now,
Miss Parker.
Excuse me.
What do you want?
We spoke to the sheriff
outside ofTahoe.
He recognized the picture
of Che Ling I put on the Internet.
- So?
- <i>So she was found three days</i>
<i>after that 911 call.</i>
She'd been beaten to death
and dumped near the highway.
<i>No one claimed the body.</i>
<i>She was buried in a pauper's grave.</i>
Are you telling me my father secretly married
a mail-order bride and then killed her?
- No, not exactly.
- The marriage records were erased, of course.
But Broots found this wedding photo
in the back issue of a Vegas newspaper.
Son of a bitch.
[Sniffing]
<i>[Gas Hissing]</i>
[Beeping]
Harold never could get
that gas leak fixed.
Burns!
I know you're in here.
Now let's just end this
without anybody gettin' hurt.
- Change of heart?
- Jarod!
Was this your idea
of protecting me?
What? No!
No, you don't understand.
I talked to Sheriff Carver.
- He's on our side.
- He's on our side?
- Yes.
- Then why did he have his gun drawn?
He wants to talk to you. That's all.
I explained everything to him.
I told him you never
could have done this.
Please, just go in
and talk to him, okay?
Okay.
I want this to be over.
I know you do.
Jarod?
I love you.
Angel.
We need to talk.
- You look like you just saw a ghost.
- More like the grim reaper.
Oh, I came this close
to dropping my guard.
Tears for Mom, trust,
second chances.
Something she never got.
- I'm glad it's out in the open.
- Then you admit knowing her?
Of course he knew her.
He was married to her, for Pete's sake.
Daddy, you're aware of all this?
I told you he confided in me.
[Chuckles]
You went to Las Vegas.
<i>I have a picture of you outside</i>
<i>Che Ling's apartment building.</i>
He was kind enough to help me
tie up some loose ends.
You mean cover up a murder,
don't you?
<i>That's way out ofline.</i>
I was afraid...
that's what might have
happened to her.
Like you didn't know?
I had nothing to do with
<i>Che Ling's death. I loved her!
Then why all the secrets?
<i>Couples have problems.
<i>I came home one day,</i>
<i>and she was gone.</i>
She took off with some drifter type,
I heard.
<i>Hey, she left because you hit her.</i>
- You see?
- Never touched her.
- How do you know?
- 'Cause he said he didn't.
<i>Now, everybody makes mistakes.</i>
<i>At least you can give him another chance.</i>
I won't try to justify
everything that happened.
But I'm not the same person
that I was.
I've changed...
and I hope that someday
you'll understand that...
embrace it.
<i>This whole deal isn't worth</i>
<i>the powder to blow it to hell.</i>
I mean, we're a family.
It's about time we started acting like one.
Now I'm gonna demand that
we all go out to dinner together tonight.
Huh? If you can't trust your family,
who can you trust?
The small bag stays with me. Make sure
the trunks are sent ahead to the airport.
I wish you'd postpone this trip.
- Harold's will is watertight.
That's what you said.
- He's been dead less than a week.
Yesterday, Burns and Carver were
blown to bits in a cabin owned by you.
It might look better if you didn't appear
so anxious to get out of town.
Let me tell you something, counselor.
Jarod Burns murdered my husband and then
killed Sheriff Carver to cover his tracks.
It's just my good fortune that
he screwed up and killed himself.
I'm on the flight to Paris in two hours.
Do you have all the bank information?
The money will be wired to Paris
by the end of the week.
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- Yeah.
Are you sure?
- Can't it be sent ahead to Paris?
- What's wrong?
It appears there's an addendum
to Harold's original will.
- Meaning?
- Without your signature,
you'll forfeit a sum of money.
- How much?
- <i>$50,000.</i>
But considering the inheritance
is nearly 10 million...
I don't think it's anything
you need to worry about.
I don't pay you to think.
Switch my flight to midnight and have your
assistant bring me those papers before I leave.
- But what about-
- Just do it!
<i>Good afternoon, Mrs. Kincade!</i>
- Who the hell are you?
- You helped me the other day
at your restaurant?
What are you doing here?
My little girl wanted to thank you.
And we wanted to say how sorry we were
for the loss of your husband.
What are you people doing on my property?
This is a private residence.
The deputy let us in
the front gate.
- The deputy?
- I hope we're not interrupting.
- <i>[Glass Breaking]</i>
- I saw you die.
<i>You should have taken</i>
<i>your original flight, Kristi.</i>
<i>But then again, I knew a girl like you</i>
<i>couldn't give up $50,000.</i>
- Jarod.
- Maybe you'd better sit down.
You look a little weak
in the knees.
I saw you walk into the cabin.
I saw-
No, you saw
what you wanted to see.
What you didn't see was Sheriff Carver
and me go out the back door...
<i>before your homemade bomb</i>
<i>blew it to bits.</i>
Oh, Sheriff Carver, he confessed
to the murder of your husband...
and he implicated you
in the whole thing.
- Jarod-
- It was a brilliant plan.
Really. I mean,
you had all the bases covered.
I mean, what better partner in a murder than
the man who was covering the investigation?
<i>And you both played</i>
<i>your parts brilliantly.</i>
I'm sorry to bother you, Ms. Kincade,
but I need to ask you some questions.
He was on fire.
Let's go, Sheriff.
Oh, and then there were
the subtle touches.
Your tears were so convincing
the night you murdered your husband.
- Stay here.
- He's my husband!
Stay here!
Routine maintenance calls to
the gas company about that pesky leak...
<i>before the "accidental"explosion.</i>
<i>The only thing that was missing</i>
<i>was a patsy-</i>
a fall guy to come along
and pin the whole thing on.
I love you.
[Echoing]
- Jarod, it was never personal.
- Oh, you're wrong.
It was very personal.
<i>[Handcuffs Clicking]</i>
You know, there is one thing
that I still can't figure out.
What's that?
Whatever happened to that
happy little girl from Corpus Christi?
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- What?
- [Jarod] I assume you found Che Ling.
I found her. She was in the county
cemetery with a wooden grave marker.
Another casualty of the Centre.
[Miss Parker]
Not according to Mr. Lyle and my father.
And you think
you can trust what they say?
As opposed to trusting you?
That's kind of like jumping out
of the fire into the fire, isn't it?
You think you know the truth
about your father...
and Mr. Lyle
and who killed your mother.
But the fact is, you only know
what the Centre wants you to know.
What do you want from me?
The same thing you want from me-
a little trust.
- I have to go.
- Be careful, Miss Parker.
Remember what your mother
used to say-
"Trust can kill you or set you free."
Ah, there's my angel.
Sweetheart, you are beautiful.
- <i>Let's get a move on.</i>
- Where's Lyle?
Oh, he called.
He's gonna meet us there.
He said he didn't want
another minute to go by...
without arranging
a proper burial for Che Ling.
[Clears Throat]
I'll get the car.
- Daddy-
- Uh-huh?
You look very handsome tonight.
You betcha.
Debbie?
Debbie?
- <i>Morning, Daddy.</i>
- Morning. Are you hungry?
Um, my ride should be here any minute.
- Well, just have a little bit. It's hot.
- Did you remember?
Remember? What?
My birthday, Daddy.
I've told you all year
what I really, really want is-
Is a trip to Paris.
And you know what?
I can't take you to Paris until you're,
like, 25 years old.
Well, it never hurts to ask.
- No.
- <i>[Horn Honking]</i>
- Well, I gotta go.
Okay, wait.
Take this.
- Love you. See you tonight.
- I love you too.
See you... tonight.
<i>[Door Opens, Closes]</i>
[Man On Tape] Beginner's French.
Hello. My name is Pierre.
How are you?
[Speaking French]
[Repeating In French]
It's bad enough that you talk to yourself,
but in a second language?
- It's French.
- So is theJerry Lewis Fan Club, but I wouldn't join.
It's- Debbie's birthday's coming up.
<i>I wanna surprise her</i>
<i>with a trip to Paris.</i>
- <i>Pop Tarts?</i>
- They have 11 essential vitamins and minerals.
- May I ask, uh, why are you here?
- Oh, I was in the neighborhood.
- Since when?
- Since I couldn't risk talking over the phone.
<i>Listen, don't go to</i>
<i>the Centre this morning.</i>
- I want you to go straight over to the Data Annex.
- To the Data Annex? Why?
Since you installed
the new security software...
we've detected three transfers...
<i>of classified information</i>
<i>from the Centre to the annex.</i>
[Sighs]
There's a leak in the Centre.
All we know for sure
is that after each transfer...
someone broke into the annex
and took the information.
- Jarod?
- You wrote the, uh, software.
You find out.
<i>[Young Sydney]</i>
<i>Tell me what you've discovered, Jarod.</i>
Structural reinforcements
here, here, here and here.
It should allow the building
to withstand an earthquake of 7.5.
Excellent, Jarod.
Your design will save many lives.
Yes, but if the reinforcements...
<i>were to be damaged</i>
<i>by an explosion by sabotage...</i>
the whole thing would go down.
Don't worry. The Centre would
never allow that to happen.
[Young Jarod]
I hope so, Sydney.
<i>If not, hundreds and hundreds</i>
<i>of people could die.</i>
<i>[Young Sydney's Voice] Don't worry.</i>
<i>The Centre would never allow that to happen.</i>
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already</i>
<i>demonstrating more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
[Jarod] There. That's all there is to it.
Now you try, Kenny.
- Oh, Jarod, I'll never be able to do this.
- Oh, sure you will.
[Man] They found out
you refused to complete the last sim...
and they asked for the three of us
to come down here.
[Man #2] We want to strongly
encourage you to reconsider.
<i>[Kenny]</i>
<i>Jarod, help! Help! It hurts! Jarod!</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>No!</i>
- <i>[Bell Jingling]</i>
- Hey, George.
- Hey.
- Busy day, huh?
I've seen livelier morgues.
- Uh-
- Yeah, sure, go ahead.
Okay.
<i>[Buzzer Sounds]</i>
Hey, Norman.
- So, I hear you've had three data intercepts.
- Four.
<i>It happened again last night.</i>
<i>You know what I can't figure out though is-</i>
What would anyone want
from this place to begin with?
Top secret travel itineraries?
<i>Clandestine expense reports?
Well, let's see if
we can unlock the mystery.
<i>This'll take a couple</i>
<i>of minutes to come up.</i>
I gotta go see a man about a horse.
Hey, that's a cool shirt.
[Beeping]
- Hey.
- What?
<i>Someone's accessing</i>
<i>this information right now.</i>
- What?
- Who the hell'd want this?
Morning.
<i>[Man On Tape] Would you care tojoin me</i>
<i>for a romantic dinner and a movie?</i>
[Speaking French]
Um-

Oh, my God.
[Gasps]
Wait!
<i>[Man On Tape]</i>
<i>I would like coffee and a croissant.</i>
<i>[Speaking French]</i>
- What's up?
- We've had an incident at Data Annex.
<i>[Mr. Lyle] Prelim says the entire</i>
<i>in-house staffhas been "depersonneled."</i>
- Broots was there.
- <i>He was spotted running from the scene.</i>
I dispatched a decon team
to find him.
A decontamination team
for Broots?
Miss Parker, there's
a leak in the Centre.
<i>Someone downloaded "eyes only"data</i>
<i>to a mole at the annex.</i>
Broots could be the mole. Hell,
he could be the shooter for all we know.
<i>Broots? Broots couldn't do that.</i>
We don't know that.
Not for sure.
All we know is that
we've been compromised.
<i>The Tower's declared this</i>
<i>a Schedule 7 incident.</i>
- Do you know what that means?
- We're ghosting Broots.
<i>[Tires Screeching, Horn Honking]</i>
Hey, watch it!
<i>Come on! Come on!
Hello? Hello?
- [Ringing]
- Sydney.
Sydney! Oh, God.
Thank God you're there.
- Broots, are you all right?
- Yes. No!
No, I'm not all right! Sydney,
they-they killed everybody in the place!
And-And they're trying to kill me!
They're after me!
<i>Calm down, Broots.
- I can't calm- I can't calm-
- Broots?
Syd? Sydney?
- [Dial Tone]
- Broots?
Sydney! Hello?
[Female Recording] We're sorry.
Your cellular service has been deactivated.
Please contact your provider

<i>[Miss Parker's Voice] Since you</i>
<i>installed the new security software...</i>
<i>we have detected</i>

<i>[Broots's Voice, Echoing]</i>
<i>There's a leak in the Centre.</i>
- [Ringing]
- Broots?
They're all dead.
Everybody's dead.
There's a-There's a man in there with a gun.
He tried to kill me.
- Tell me where you are.
- Miss Parker sent me.
- Where's Miss Parker?
- She's not here.
Try and calm down.
They're not going to let us talk for long.
- Sydney, what the hell is going on?
- You're in great danger, Broots.
You and everyone you know
may be a potential target.
Oh, God! Debbie!
I don't know what's going on, Broots.
Maybe you saw something.
- We're under a Schedule 7.
- A Schedule 7?
- Remember your training. And, Broots?
- Yeah?
<i>Don't trust anyone.</i>
Sydney? Sydney!
What the hell do you think
you're doing?
Standard procedure.
Until we know what's going on here...
Broots is persona non grata.
<i>For God's sakes, Lyle.</i>
<i>The man has a daughter to take care of.</i>
We can't leave him out there.
Broots and his daughter
are not my problem.
- <i>[Bell Ringing]</i>
- Come on, Debbie.
<i>Come on.
Where are you?
- <i>Ha-ha!</i>
- Get out of here, you little-
- You're dead!
- Get out of here, you little mongrel!
You're dead!
Miss Parker.
Debbie!
- <i>[Sydney's Voice] Broots, don't trust anyone.</i>
- No!
<i>Wait!</i>
- Where's my daddy?
- Miss Parker!
Debbie!
This isn't good.
Hello?
My computer.
I'm sorry, Debbie.
I know I promised I'd never use this.
Shh, shh, shh, shh!
Oh! Jarod!
Please. I'm-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do it.
- Do what?
- Whatever it is you're gonna try and kill me for.
I'm not trying to kill you.
I'm here to help you.
<i>I've been waiting for you.</i>
<i>We don't have much time.</i>
Little time. For what?
- You just have to trust me.
- Sydney told me not- not to trust anyone.
<i>You might wanna reconsider that.</i>
Oh!
Get in the car.
Get in the car!
- Are you all right?
- No.
I'm not all right.
I'm as far from all right as I'm ever gonna be.
I've seen people murdered.
They've taken my daughter.
They've broken into my house. They're
tryin' to kill me, and I'm sitting here with you.
No, no, I'm not all right.
I wanna know what the hell's going on.
It's about the data intercepts
you were sent to investigate at the annex.
How is it that you know so much
about what's going on at the Centre?
A former Centre operative...
has been working with a coconspirator
inside the Centre.
<i>In order to conceal their identities</i>
<i>and their activities...</i>
he murdered everyone at the annex.
And now, he's after you.
But I don't know anything, do I?
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is that he thinks you do.
I don't give a damn about me.
I am only concerned about my daughter.
<i>She's safe. I picked her up from school</i>
<i>and took her to my house.</i>
And Sam's keeping her
out of harm's way for now.
<i>The Cleaners reported in</i>
<i>from the annex.</i>
- They found a mess, but few answers.
- What about Broots?
The decon team's still looking for him.
They confiscated his home computer.
<i>It's being cross-analyzed to see</i>
<i>if we can pin him down as the leak.</i>
Broots isn't the leak.
But he could find out who is.
That's not how it works.
Broots lives or dies on his own...
<i>until and if</i>
<i>this matter's resolved.</i>
<i>I'm afraid Mr. Lyle</i>
<i>does not share your sense ofloyalty.</i>
<i>Centre reality check.</i>
<i>Broots is expendable.</i>
I'm not sure a monkey
couldn't do what he does.
I can't believe you weren't
spawned under some rock...
<i>instead ofbeing born of the same</i>
<i>flesh and blood I came from.</i>
<i>As much as I hate to admit it...</i>
Broots is more of a brother
to me than you'll ever be.
I won't throw him out
like a piece of garbage.
Hark.
Do I hear violins playing?
Lyle, reality check.
I intend to get to the bottom
of the Centre's problem...
without sacrificing Broots
in the process.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Wow.</i>
I've seen a lot of your old hideouts,
but I never thought I'd be here with you.
Neither did I.
You hungry?
[Chuckles]
My daughter loves these.
They have 11 essential
vitamins and minerals.
Listen, Jarod, I can't stay here.
<i>I've gotta find Debbie.</i>
<i>Miss Parker took her.</i>
In fact, it was Miss Parker who sent me
to the Data Annex in the first place.
Miss Parker is many things, but
she would never do that, especially to you.
She doesn't have it
in her heart...
- or her eyes.
- <i>I know what you mean.</i>
The guy that shot up the annex-
who shot at my house-
<i>now he had it in his eyes.</i>
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Jarod, this is Damon.</i>
The Tower has asked him to work with you
on some special projects.
Jarod. I've heard a lot about you.
<i>[Kenny's Voice]</i>
<i>Jarod, help! Help! It hurts, Jarod!</i>
You know him?
Yes, I know him.
<i>For the past several months...</i>
I've been intercepting
communications...
between a man named Damon
and his source at the Centre.
<i>The source has been transferring sims</i>
<i>that I performed to the Data Annex.</i>
But the Data Annex
is only for storage...
of routine,
unclassified information.
That's exactly why he had them
transferred there.
The lack of security allowed Damon...
<i>to break in as needed</i>
<i>and download the sims.</i>
But my new software found a trail
leading right back to them.
You were at the wrong place
at the wrong time, Mr. Broots.
- <i>Damon was just covering his tracks.</i>
- Damn.
He's already used three of my sims.
Now he's stolen a fourth.
I don't know what it is.
But I do know that he plans
on using it tomorrow at 5:00.
But what's so important
about four old sims...
that would cause him
to kill all those people?
Our clients were impressed
with your recommendations...
to improve the safety
of their aircraft.
There's one other thing, Sydney.
I know it's unlikely,
but if the plane were to encounter...
a focused burst of electromagnetic energy
in the ultrahigh frequency range...
the pilot would lose control.
<i>Jarod, I'll be sure to alert</i>
<i>our client about your concerns.</i>
You have nothing to worry about.
<i>I hope so, Sydney.</i>
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
And... the subway?
And the consulate?
Damon took your work
and used it to kill?
I need your help, Broots.
I have to get back into the annex.
<i>I have to find out</i>
<i>what that fourth sim is.</i>
We've gotta stop Damon...
before there's another headline.
<i>Okay, I'll help.</i>
<i>But before we go in...</i>
I have to find out
what's happening to Debbie.
But the Centre, they won't let me in.
- Well, they can't keep me out.
- <i>[Phone Beeping]</i>
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- <i>This is Sydney.</i>
- <i>Sydney, it's Broots.</i>
- <i>Broots, where are you?</i>
- I gotta know where Debbie is.
- Miss Parker took Debbie to her house.
- She's guarded around the clock.
- Oh, thank God.
And, Sydney, please thank
Miss Parker for me, would you?
Mmm.
There's, uh, someone here
l-I think you'd like to speak to.
- Sydney, Damon is back.
- Damon?
- Are you sure?
- I've seen him.
He tried to kill Broots after
he murdered everyone at the annex.
Now he's working with
someone inside the Centre.
They're using my old sims
to orchestrate attacks.
I know when he's planning
to hit next...
but I don't know how,
and I don't know where.
Let me see what I can find out.
But please be careful.
- Remember what Damon is capable of.
- Oh, I remember.
I remember everything.
There.
That's all there is to it.
Now you try, Kenny.
Oh, Jarod, I'll never
be able to do this.
Sure you can.
We'll keep on practicing.
Put this point there.
<i>Now press down the fold.</i>
<i>Very good.</i>
- <i>[Kenny]Jarod, help me! Jarod!</i>
- <i>[Jarod] No!</i>
<i>[Damon]</i>
<i>I knowJarod.</i>
I know how his mind works.
He'll come to me.
[Man] We can't take the slightest chance
on them discovering our activity.
I'll take care of it.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Whoa.</i>
That's what I call a cleanup.
This is the computer Damon was at.
We have 10 minutes max
before they detect us.
- Do you think you can find out
what he was accessing?
- Well, I designed the system.
Um, that's a- that's a maybe.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>So let me get this straight.</i>
They can send a man to the moon, but neither
of you can open up Broots's system...
to backtrack who the leak is
in this place?
- We're searching.
- Search faster.
- And where the hell have you been?
- I've been... occupied.
You look frustrated.
Well, your monkeys seem to have
a bit of trouble peeling this banana.
We're all just trying to find
the answers, Miss Parker.
My Sweepers have also been unable
to locate Broots's daughter.
Have any idea
where she might be?
- Do I look like a babysitter?
- <i>[Man] Uh, Miss Parker?</i>
<i>Someone's accessing the computer</i>
<i>at the Data Annex now.</i>
Who?
Based on the password,
it appears to be... Mr. Broots.
Damn. Get me the imbecile
who's supposed to be guarding the annex.
Now!
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Just about there.</i>
All right. Jarod,
I know it's not my place to ask...
but what exactly happened
between you and Damon?
You're right.
It's not your place to ask.
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
- <i>[Footsteps Overhead]</i>
- [Whispering] I'm not done yet.
- Keep working.
Hold it... right there.
Real easy-like,
bring that gun up where I can see it.
<i>Come on.
Now, turn around slowly.
[Chuckles]
Well, well, well. Look what I got here.
Well, at least I didn't shoot him.
Next time, you might wanna
put some bullets in it.
[Muffled]
You wanna untie me?
<i>[Muffled]</i>
<i>Hey! What are you doing?</i>
Ooh. Boy-
I could sure use a drink about now.
I'd settle for the D.S.A.
That we just risked our lives for.
Oh, yeah. Sure.
I'm sorry.
- Jarod, please.
- I'm not going to do it.
You have to finish this project.
No, Sydney.
I can't do this.
Jarod, we know the enemy
is trying to genetically alter...
the smallpox virus
to carry Ebola.
<i>Our only interest is in developing</i>
<i>a vaccine to prevent a holocaust.</i>
I'm not comfortable
with this area of research.
I don't understand, Jarod.
In order to make a vaccine,
I have to re-create the deadly organism.
- Mm-hmm.
- Concentrations to achieve airborne toxicity...
solubility levels, half-lives.
It would be too easy for somebody
to take this information...
and use it destructively.
I don't wanna see that happen.
This Damon-
He's gonna- He's gonna use your work
to biologically attack someone?
Tomorrow at 5:00.
The question is-Who?
What have you found out
about the leak?
If I had Broots, I'd be a lot further along.
But as it is, your monkeys...
have only been able to identify
that the Centre leak...
has arranged for the delivery
of some kind of shipment.
- To whom?
- They don't know who or where
or why or even when.
That happens when you don't have
an opposable thumb.
All we have to go on appears
to be the shipment order.
- <i>It's in code.</i>
- Brilliant analysis.
They're trying to break it now.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know
there was anyone here with you.
Oh. I believe
Mr. Lyle was just leaving.
Well, I am really impressed
with all you <i>don't</i> know.
<i>I'd love it if you'd surprise me</i>
<i>with something we can work with.</i>
I believe the two of you are taking
the concept of sibling rivalry to new levels.
Excuse me, Syd.
I have work to do.
77, 02, 30-
<i>[Continues On Phone]</i>
<i>14, 98, 1,500.</i>
- What does it mean?
- Sorry, Jarod, I don't know.
That's all I have.
- I'll get right on it.
- Thank you, Sydney.
Jarod, don't let
your feelings for Damon...
your desire for revenge-
Don't let it destroy you.
This time, I'm going to stop him.
I know how you feel, Jarod.
And how could you know
how I feel?
I was a Pretender once.
- Was?
- They gave me my freedom.
I can get 'em to do the same for you.
- I don't trust them.
- Yeah, neither did I.
Just finish this last sim,
and I promise you, we'll walk out of here.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>We've only got a few hours left.</i>
[Groans]
I know it's not difficult.
<i>It's a simple problem.</i>
<i>It's- They're the most trouble.</i>
You know better than anyone.
It's like the clues you leave us all the time.
- I know we can crack it.
- We have to.
I want my life back.
I want-
I want my daughter back.
She's beautiful.
Well, you know, I may not be
the most successful person in the world...
<i>but there's one thing that no one else</i>
<i>can do or be, and that's her dad.</i>
She's-
I miss her.
Don't worry.
You'll see her soon.
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?
Well, I try and catch you every day.
I mean, it's my job.
But... why are you helping me?
Because... I respect you.
Me?
I can only hope that one day,
I'll be half the father that you are.
You know, I planned
to spend her birthday...
traveling through France.
Traveling.
Traveling!
- These numbers aren't code.
- They're G.P.S. Coordinates.
- Exactly.
- <i>Date, time, location.</i>
<i>Where and when Damon is going</i>
<i>to receive the shipment.</i>
<i>[Broots] Well, we know</i>
<i>the "when"is in two hours...</i>
<i>and the "where"is in</i>
<i>a small park outside of D.C.</i>
<i>Come on.
- Miss Parker.
- One of the techs just gave this to me.
<i>An intercepted phone call.</i>
[Sydney On Tape]
98, 1,500.
- <i>[Jarod] What does it mean?</i>
- <i>Sorry, Jarod, I don't know.</i>
<i>That's all I have.</i>
<i>You gaveJarod information,</i>
<i>information you stole from me.</i>
<i>You gaveJarod information,</i>
<i>information you stole from me.</i>
- Miss Parker, please.
- No, Sydney!
I'm out there risking my ass for Broots
while you're here working behind my back.
You wanna tell me that's not true?
- Parker, does Lyle know about this?
- For now, no.
You wanna tell me why
I shouldn't give him that myself?
Sit down, please.
<i>Shortly beforeJarod</i>
<i>escaped from the Centre...</i>
we were having trouble
controlling him.
<i>His growing sense ofhumanity</i>
<i>was creating inner conflict over his work.</i>
<i>Against my wishes...</i>
the Centre brought in
an operative named Damon...
to help break him.
<i>What I didn't know was that Damon</i>
<i>and the Centre had a hidden agenda.</i>
<i>Damon exploited Jarod</i>
<i>as he progressively gained his trust.</i>
They've agreed.
You finish this last sim,
and you can leave.
This virus they want me to develop-
it's a Pandora's box.
I don't know who will have the key.
Jarod, this is your freedom.
<i>Jarod was in turmoil.</i>
<i>He came to see me for advice.</i>
- I tried to allay his fears.
- So what happened?
- Obviously, the Centre
never gave him his freedom.
- <i>It was all a lie.</i>
It wasn't just another Centre exploitation
ofJarod. It was the ultimate one.
Jarod befriended Kenny...
<i>a janitor at the Centre</i>
<i>who possessed a childlike innocence.</i>
<i>Jarod felt very</i>
<i>protective ofhim...</i>
and Damon knew that.
<i>That's very good.</i>
<i>Isn't it, Damon?</i>
And what's this about?
<i>[Damon] They found out</i>
<i>you refused to complete the last sim...</i>
and they asked for the three of us
to come down here.
Jarod, for you.
We want to strongly
encourage you to reconsider.
[Yelling]
- What are you doing?
- You have got one minute to change your mind.
- Are you crazy?
- Jarod, listen to me! Listen!
He's gonna kill him,
and probably both of us as well.
Listen, for Kenny's sake, finish
the last sim and walk away from this place.
[Kenny]
Jarod?
[Groaning]
Help!
Here.
I already finished the sim. It has everything
you need. Everything they need is on this!
Now take it!
What are you-
Help, Jarod.
[Groaning]
- Jarod!
- No!
- [Gunshot]
- No!
The Centre owns you,
and there's nothin' you can do about it.
Don't make it so difficult
next time.
<i>Three weeks later, Jarod escaped.</i>
- My God, Sydney.
- <i>Damon betrayed Jarod's trust...</i>
and he confirmed all of
Jarod's suspicions about the Centre.
And destroyed Jarod's hope...
of ever being given his freedom.
Damon was later exiled
for stealing Centre secrets.
He's doing it again now.
Do you understand why I'm trying to help?
I understand Broots
is the loose end.
And in order for him to survive,
Damon has to be stopped...
for good.
[No Audible Dialogue]
He just handed Damon
a metal case.
- The smallpox?
- Worse.
<i>He's not going to get away,</i>
<i>not this time.</i>
Wait. Jarod! Jarod!
Give me the case.
Jarod.
My friend.
Let's get one thing straight.
I'm not your friend.
Now give me the case.
Still worried about the innocent masses?
Still the same?
- Jarod- humanity's seed of hope.
- Give me the case.
TheJarod I knew
couldn't pull that trigger.
You wanna stop me,
shoot me in the back.
My guess is you're still
too human for that.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Jarod!</i>
- <i>[Broots] Now don't move.</i>
- <i>[Jarod Groans]</i>
Okay, just like that.
- Why are you doing this?
- What?
You could take me
into the Centre.
<i>The Schedule 7 or not, with me</i>
<i>as the prize, they would welcome you back.</i>
Well, the way I figure...
there's a time
and a place for everything.
And right now, I owe you.
Besides, I respect you.
- Ow. Me?
- Yeah.
You help people.
You care.
When others look away,
you-you try and make a difference.
Well, I didn't make
a difference this time.
And that's why you can't look away now,
and neither can I.
You know, considering
what we've been through...
I think I have a right
to ask you this.
What happened between
you and Damon?
[Sighs]
It's on the D.S.A.
Because, you know,
I've been thinking about what you said...
about discovering Damon's pattern.
<i>It's- It's obviously political...</i>
even possibly global.
A private,
nondenominational service...
<i>to pray for an end</i>
<i>to the Bosnian conflict...</i>
<i>is scheduled for 5.00</i>
<i>this afternoon...</i>
here at Freedom Hall in Georgetown.
- Take it!
- <i>The service...</i>
<i>referred to by the parties</i>
<i>as the "seed ofhope"-</i>
Humanity's seed of hope.
<i>Will bring together representatives</i>
<i>of the Czech Republic...</i>
<i>Serbia and Bosnia...</i>
<i>on the eve of the peace talks which are</i>
<i>scheduled to start Monday in Washington.</i>
<i>The Centre owns you,</i>
<i>and there's nothin'you can do about it.</i>
- Oh, my God.
- Broots?
- <i>[Woman On TV, Indistinct]</i>
- <i>Broots?</i>
<i>He's going to hit the service.</i>
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Sydney? Sydney?</i>
The floodgates
have finally opened.
The techs have finished
putting all the pieces together.
- You know where and when
Damon is going to strike?
- The jet's waiting.
- What about Lyle?
- Leave him here to run his circus.
<i>[Chorus Vocalizing]</i>
<i>[Broots] How do you think</i>
<i>he's gonna deliver the virus? The wine?</i>
Not everyone is going
to take Communion.
But everyone's going
to breathe the air.
Jarod, look.
It's Damon.
- Aerosol delivery.
- <i>He's gonna spray the crowd.</i>
- Get everyone out of here.
- Okay.
Uh- Excuse me!
Uh, I've been alerted
there's a bomb in the building.
So if you could all just please exit,
uh, quickly and calmly, please.
<i>Jarod. You just can't</i>
<i>leave it alone, can you?</i>
<i>This isn't about you.</i>
You're using my work to infect countless
numbers of people. And for what?
Gotta make a living.
Who's helping you
at the Centre?
The same person
who always has.
- Ow!
- <i>Back off, Jarod...</i>
or you can say good-bye
to another friend.
Not this time.
[Grunts]
Damon!
Let him go.
This is between us.
Your friend comes with me.
I'll let him go...
when I know
I haven't been followed.
That's funny.
I believed you once.
- Then you know what I'm capable of.
- No, Jarod.
It's over, Damon.
You're not gonna pull
that trigger, Jarod.
<i>You don't have it</i>
<i>in your eyes...</i>
just like when we were
together at the Centre.
He has a daughter...
who needs him.
That doesn't make any difference.
[Groans]
No!
It does to me!
King me.
- Daddy!
- Ah!
- Debbie!
- Daddy, I missed you so much.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Oh!</i>
Oh, I missed you too. Oh!
I got something for you.
Happy birthday.
Paris?
<i>Je t'aime,</i> Daddy!
<i>Je t'aime aussi.</i>
Sam, let's go.
There's a couple of things
I need to wrap up at the Centre.
Good game, kid.
I love you, Daddy.
- <i>This is Sydney.</i>
- <i>[Jarod On Phone] It's me.</i>
- You okay, Jarod?
- Physically.
It's natural to struggle to come
to terms with what happened.
I never...
pulled the trigger before.
I pray you never
have to again, Jarod.
The guilt you're feeling
comes from a conflict...
over your desire to
exact revenge for Kenny...
and the necessity
of what you did.
I just keep playing the moment
over and over in my head.
You saved Broots's life...
and the lives of
untold numbers of people.
I just...
feel so empty.
You have to forgive yourself, Jarod.
There's an old saying:
"He who saves but one life...
saves the entire world."
L-I have to go.
[Slapping Sound]
I don't understand, Sydney.
Why are these guys hitting each other?
- F.E.S., Broots.
- F.E. S?
Forced External Stimulus.
I'm studying the way twins react
to identically implied aggression.
[Scoffs] Looks to me like they're just
beatin' the bejesus out of each other.
- Did you need something, Broots?
- Oh, yeah.
I, uh-This came for you.
Looks kind of important.
<i>"Your immediate attention is needed"?</i>
In Jarod's handwriting.
You've never seen this.
Seen what?
<i>[Chuckling]</i>
[Imitating Curly]
Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk. Yee!
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
Hey, Barker! You got a visitor!
- What?
- You got company!
- <i>There's a guy out front wants to see ya.</i>
- A guy?
- Yeah, with the dogs.
- Dogs?
<i>[Barking Continues, Growling]</i>
[Kissing Sounds]
That's it. Take it. Mm-hmm.
[Laughing]
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>
<i>Do you like dogs, Mr. Barker?</i>
Not as much as you do.
Roman fighting rottweilers.
Pound for pound, the most perfect
killing machine on four legs, huh?
Give me a dog over a person any day.
Oh, Jack Brevins. I'm your P.O.
Parole officer?
We weren't supposed to meet
till next week.
Yeah, I know. I was in the neighborhood.
Big Daddy here needed to be wormed.
The baby needed to be wormed,
didn't you, sweetie?
- Yeah. So, how you gettin' on?
- Fine.
- No problems with the job?
- It's a little slice of heaven.
That's funny. You're a funny guy.
- I gotta get back to work.
- Uh, let's take a walk.
- It's not my break yet.
- <i>Hey.</i>
It's okay.
<i>[Dog Growls]</i>
<i>[Boat Horn Blows]</i>
You know, a lot of guys have trouble
adjusting to freedom after bein' locked up.
You were up for, what- six and change?
- Mr. Brevins.
- Jack.
Look, I appreciate all the personal attention,
Jack, but I have to get back to work.
I can't afford to lose this job. I don't want
to end up back in prison, now do I?
You don't know how it works, do you?
You behave yourself,
you do exactly what you're told...
everything's gravy.
<i>You get an attitude,</i>
<i>you disrupt the program...</i>
I pick up the phone, and you got a number
on your back before breakfast.
We'll continue this later.
<i>Oh, hey. I read your file.</i>
[Sniffs]
<i>Consider that an advance.</i>
<i>That's good stuff. None of that</i>
<i>jailhouse crap you used to shoot.</i>
I'll be in touch.
<i>Come on, babies. Let's go. Let's go for a ride.
<i>Come on.</i> Come on. Yes. Yes.
- <i>Go for a ride in the car. We love the car. Yeah.</i>
- <i>[Barking]</i>
<i>I hope you came alone.</i>
I believe you're safe, for the moment.
- You look good, Sydney.
- You too. And I like the artwork.
Just trying to blend in.
Are you going to tell me why I'm here,
or is this some kind of game we're playing?
Oh, it's no game, especially to them.
<i>[Sydney's Voice]</i>
<i>Michelle, am I his father?</i>
<i>[Michelle's Voice] Sydney,</i>
<i>Nicholas doesn't know he's your son.</i>
I don't understand. Why did you-
<i>[Water Running]</i>
What the-Who are-You're-
The word is-
[Whispers] "naked."
I bought groceries.
[Chuckles]
- Hope you like sugar.
- Who are you?
Sandi, with an "I."
- How did you get in here?
- Desk clerk.
He's a friend ofJack's.
- Jack Brevins?
- Is there another?
You want something to drink?
I've got kiwi-papaya juice.
A friend turned me on to it.
It's fantastic.
In fact, it's fantastically fantastic.
So, you got an awesome view.
It's a lumberyard.
Well, they used to be trees,
so that almost makes it a forest.
- You said thatJack sent you?
- Mmm. Like a housewarming gift.
He said to think of me
as a "living, breathing welcome mat."
There is no way this is going to happen.
- What-What are you doing?
- Look, I'm really exhausted.
I had a really long day.
I can't go. If you send me away,
Jack'll think I pissed you off.
Jack can get real nasty
when he doesn't get what he wants.
<i>Hey. Pretty lady.</i>
Who is she?
[Scoffs]
She's my mother.
No. Really? Oh, that's so sweet.
<i>God, I haven't seen my mom</i>
<i>in nearly, uh, two years.</i>
So, what were you in prison for?
- Does it matter?
- Well, a girl likes to know who she's drinkin' with.
I mean, you didn't kill somebody,
did you?
Okay. I can drop you off on my way downtown,
or I can call you a cab.
- Those are your choices.
- Or I could go with you.
Are you in some kind of trouble?
- Well, that depends.
- Depends on what?
On you.
We should get some more
of this kiwi juice.
It's a passion fruit.
<i>Can I help you?
Oh, I'm Dr. Sydney. I was called in
to consult on the Stamatis case.
I wasn't told about any consultation.
Well, there must have been some kind
of clerical error, Nurse... Roberts.
I've traveled a long way, and I'm tired.
Now, we can get on with this,
or I can take it up with your supervisor.
It's up to you.
[Sighs]
That's Mr. Stamatis's room.
Oh, Nurse. How's he doing?
<i>Considering he may have
only hours to live...
<i>he and Mrs. Stamatis are doing fine.</i>
Thank you.
I think it's sad when things change.
I used to come here when I was a kid.
There was this gigantic slide.
It must've been 50, 60 feet high.
Kind of like this monster?
[Chuckling]
But... it was so much bigger.
Maybe because you were
a little peanut back then.
<i>Uh, excuse me. I'll be right back.</i>
Don't eat the sand, baby.
<i>It's almost like looking into a mirror.</i>
Yes, it is.
Do you mind if I sit down?
It's a public park.
<i>I used to wonder what it would be like</i>
<i>to grow up so close to somebody...</i>
to have a bond like that
that could never be broken.
You sound like a man
who misses his family.
Is it that obvious?
Some people wear their lives
in their eyes...
and some on their skin.
- How long you been out of prison?
- Almost a week.
I wish you luck.
<i>Come on, boys. Mama's gotta
get home and get supper started.
They look just like their father.
What did you say?
- Who are you?
- My name is Jarod.
Bobby, your husband, and I...
we were in the same cell block
at Mayfield Pen.
This picture?
It was taken three days
before he was released.
<i>Lupe, I don't mean to upset you.</i>
I know it's only been a few weeks
since Bobby was-was killed.
Bobby had so much going for him
when he got out of prison.
<i>The boys, a goodjob, me.</i>
It doesn't make any sense.
<i>He wasn't a violent man.</i>
- It doesn't make any sense.
- <i>I know.</i>
That's why I'm here.
No, you listen to me!
You miss one more appointment
at this office...
I'm gonna slap a warrant on your ass so fast,
you won't know what hit you.
<i>Yeah. Right. Right.</i>
<i>You're not as stupid as you look.</i>
<i>8.00 tonight.</i>
So, how's freedom treatin' you
on this fine morning, Jarod?
- It takes gettin' used to.
- It's a big world, full of surprises.
Kinda like that surprise I found
in my shower yesterday.
She didn't give you any lip, did she?
No. Just wasn't expecting guests,
that's all.
<i>It's like ridin'a bicycle.</i>
<i>You know how to ride a bicycle, don't ya?</i>
You get on and you just-
[Laughing]
- Now, that's funny.
- Yeah.
<i>You know what else is funny? Here I am, fresh</i>
<i>out of prison, and already my parole officer...</i>
he's supplied me with enough smack
to kill a horse...
<i>and a female</i>
<i>who may or may not be underage.</i>
Now, if the intention is to ease
the inmate back into society...
this seems a little bit rushed.
Well, I didn't expect you to shoot
the entire bag in one sitting.
As for the bimbo,
she's 22 goin' on 15.
<i>Come on. Sit down.
I just like my people
to be relaxed when they work.
And by "work," you don't mean
the metal shop, I assume.
Jarod Barker.
Arrested at age 14...
for petty larceny.
Spent six months
in the Krendler Youth Camp.
<i>Three convictions for narcotics</i>
<i>and weapons charges.</i>
<i>Two aggravated assault convictions...</i>
and a handful of parole violations.
I won a spelling bee once
when I was seven.
Look.
You know how many opportunities are out there
for an ex-con with a history of violence?
<i>Zero. Nada.</i>
Life as you know it is over.
<i>Be at this address tonight at 10.00 p.m.</i>
<i>Oh, and, Jarod, one more thing.</i>
Stay away from Lupe Harmon.
How'd you know I talked to Lupe?
It's my job to know what you do.
<i>You did time with her husband up in Mayfiield.</i>
<i>What's his name?</i>
- What was his name?
- Bobby.
Right. Bobby. Terrible situation.
- He was one of your guys, wasn't he?
- <i>Just stay away from the widow.</i>
She can only cause you trouble.
You're the boss, right?
May I join you?
Sydney.
What are you doing here?
I thought you might need a friend.
Yeah.
- I like it here.
- Mmm.
Especially in the morning,
when everything still seems possible.
Sorry.
It's all right.
Thank you.
He's only 54 years old, Sydney.
It's not fair.
No, it's not.
How did you know that George was here?
An old friend sent me a message.
<i>Michelle, if you want someone</i>
<i>to talk to...</i>
someone to hold on to, I'm here.
- [Sighs]
- What is it?
It's Nicholas.
He's not handling this very well.
He's so, so angry.
It's painful
to lose someone you love.
He still doesn't know
that you're his real father.
It's not important now.
My husband is dying, Sydney.
Would you pray with me?
Of course I will.
<i>[Sandi]</i>
<i>I started dancin'when I was 17.</i>
- Were you with the ballet?
- Yeah, right.
<i>Cleared 400 a week,
and that was just workin' topless.
Topless?
What? You've never been
in a strip joint before?
<i>Naked women swinging</i>
<i>around metal poles?</i>
<i>Strange men cramming sweaty wads</i>
<i>of money into strange women's panties?</i>
- I would remember something like that.
- Yeah.
Did you, uh, tellJack
that we took a walk in the park?
I might have mentioned it.
What you workin' on?
I'm tryin' to figure out why a man
with a wife, two kids and a future...
would throw it all away for 256 bucks.
Did you know Bobby Harmon?
No. That's terrible.
You know,
I read he had small children.
<i>Twin boys.</i>
Five years old.
I gotta go.
Hey, Jarod?
I only danced for a couple of months.
And I never-you know, for money.
<i>I just don't want you to think</i>
<i>that I was that kind of girl.</i>
What kind of girl is that?
[No Audible Dialogue]
<i>Dr. Stamatis, my name is Sydney.</i>
I know who you are.
I have had this conversation
in my mind a hundred times.
I want you to know that I have
the highest regard for you...
and your relationship
with Michelle and Nicholas.
Do you still love her?
You don't need to answer.
I see it in your eyes. [Gasps]
Oh.
Thank you.
[Panting]
Nicholas... doesn't know
that you're his real father.
No.
I want you to tell him after.
I want you to take care of our son, Sydney.
- We don't have to-
- Promise.
Promise.
I promise.
Nicholas.
- [Groans]
- Nicholas. Nicholas!
- <i>[Men Cheering]</i>
- <i>[Rock]</i>
Hey, Jarod.
<i>Right on time.</i>
<i>You didn't have any trouble</i>
<i>findin'the place, did you?</i>
It's amazing. You tell the cabdriver
where to go, and he gets you there.
Ain't it though? Let me introduce you to your
new partner. Pat Rush, Jarod Barker.
Jack says you did time at Mayfield.
Six years, eight months, three days.
<i>I did a two-spot there.</i>
<i>I don't remember your face.</i>
That's because I like to hang by myself.
[Scoffs]
That's cool.
<i>If you dogs are through sniffin'each other,</i>
<i>I'd like to get down to business.</i>
My source informs me that there is
a very accessible situation out in Meadowhills.
<i>That's a new development</i>
<i>out near the lake.</i>
Houses start at half a million.
Gentlemen, it's rotting on the vine.
All we have to do
is go out there and pick it.
- I don't know.
- What did you say?
I got a bad feelin', that's all.
Son, you don't know...
what feelin' bad is really all about.
[Growling]
<i>Yo, Jack! Phone call!</i>
- Take a message.
- It's the Mexican.
<i>You boys have a beer,</i>
<i>and when I get back...</i>
I'll tell you all about
Myra and Stanley Bellows.
<i>Guy's certifiable.</i>
Word is he's been runnin' this
home invasion scam for almost five years.
- "Word is"?
- <i>A guy who knows a guy.</i>
Well, someone should stop him.
One call from Brevins,
and we're both back inside.
Don't even think about runnin' to the cops
unless you want to end up like that Harmon dude.
- Bobby Harmon?
- <i>The kid wasn't blown away by accident.</i>
My guy says Harmon was about to go to the D.A.,
drop Brevins's whole operation on the table.
<i>That's quite a little scam he's got goin'.</i>
<i>Career criminals do his dirty work...
and if we refuse, well, he violates
our parole and doubles our time.
Not to mention those frickin' dogs.
Guy loves those frickin' dogs.
How did he know that Bobby Harmon
was gonna turn him in?
Have you made one move since you've
been out he didn't know about?
<i>[Bell Tolling]</i>
How'd you find me?
- Your father said you might come here.
- <i>Ha!</i>
"My father"? That's a laugh.
This will be hard for you to understand...
<i>and you have every right to be angry,</i>
<i>but there were reasons-</i>
Reasons?
What reasons could there be...
for hiding the truth from someone about
who they are and where they came from?
Just before you were born...
I was involved with some people-
very dangerous people-
who made threats against my life.
<i>To protect me, your mother left</i>
<i>without telling me about you.</i>
- Did you look for me?
- <i>I told you.</i>
I didn't know you'd been born.
And now I don't have a father...
or a family or a life.
Nicholas.
It isn't true.
You have a wonderful mother
and a father who loves you.
He's not my father.
You're wrong, Nicholas.
Being a father is more than giving life.
It's being there in the middle of the night
when you're sick or afraid or alone.
And it's teaching you how to ride a bike,
how to catch a fish...
how to tie a tie.
Being a parent
isn't about the big moments.
It's about the little ones.
Have you ever felt those things
for anyone?
There was someone- a child.
<i>Your father loves you very much-</i>
as much as if he'd given you life.
- <i>Don't throw that away.</i>
- Why are you here?
<i>After everything is said and done...</i>
maybe you and I can be friends.
<i>[Leaves Rustling]</i>
Hello? Is someone there?
<i>[Brevins] The key is to convince these people</i>
<i>that you are serious...</i>
that you will kill them...
if they do not do exactly
what you want them to do.
- And what about Bobby Harmon?
- What about him?
I don't want to end up dead on someone's
living room floor because you forgot something.
[Sighs]
Harmon was a mistake.
End of story.
How much money did you say
these people keep in the house?
It could be north of $100,000. Apparently,
the old gentleman does not trust banks.
Just make sure you kill this power box
before you enter the house.
<i>That disables the floodlights,</i>
<i>the security system.</i>
It'll keep the rent-a-cops off your tail.
And what do we do when we're finished?
You stop by my house, and we split up the money.
We go in 12 hours.
Everybody ready?
Ready.
They say it takes the patience of a saint
to tend to a prosperous garden.
You know about flowers?
I know about patience.
I used to send Bobby
a single red rose every Friday.
He used to put them
in the window of his cell.
<i>He said they made him feel like</i>
<i>there was something worth living for.</i>
You know,
Bobby wrote me twice a week.
He never mentioned anyone named Jarod.
Oh, yeah, he probably wouldn't.
I was transferred to Bobby's cell block
three weeks before he was released...
so, you know, he probably had...
other things on his mind.
- Come here, baby.
- You have great kids.
You know, in the park you said
you'd come here for a reason.
I think Bobby was set up.
Set up?
Why would anyone want
to hurt my husband?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Where are my manners? Uh, please,
can I get you something to drink?
- That would be very nice.
- It'll have to be water or kiwi juice.
- Kiwi juice?
- Yeah, kiwi-papaya. It was Bobby's favorite.
<i>There must be a dozen bottles</i>
<i>left in the refrigerator.</i>
[Chuckles]
- Busy day?
- Oh, God.
Jarod, I didn't see you standing there.
That's surprising. I thought
you were keepin' a close eye on me.
I bought some steaks and a bottle of wine.
I thought maybe we could go up on the roof
and have ourselves a cookout.
- You knew Bobby Harmon.
- Jarod, l-
Please don't lie to me.
I knew Bobby.
Why didn't you tell me?
I was scared.
I mean, Bobby and me were friends.
<i>No, it wasn't like that.</i>
<i>He loved his wife and his kids.</i>
You told Brevins that Bobby
was going to turn him in to the police.
No. No, I never mentioned that
to anybody except for-
Except for who?
Pat Rush.
And what about me?
What's the deal with me?
Jack wanted me to get close.
Jarod, I had no choice.
This has something to do with that guy
I saw you talking to at the convalescent home.
- You followed me?
- Who was he? Just another sucker?
Or maybe just a former client
that you took pity on?
He's my little brother.
<i>His name is Michael. The doctors say</i>
<i>he'll never be any better than he is now.</i>
It was raining, and Michael had
invited me to dinner and the movies.
He loves the movies.
I, uh, never saw
the other car run the light.
Is that why your mother
won't speak to you?
Yeah, I was his big sister, you know?
I was supposed to be
looking out for him.
I thought that paying for Michael's
medical care might turn things around...
and make her understand
that it was an accident.
Private hospitals are expensive.
Three thousand dollars a month.
That's how you got involved
with Brevins.
You needed the money
to take care of your little brother.
I had nothing to do with
what happened to Bobby, I swear.
After Bobby was killed, I got scared,
and I was gonna go to the police, but...
Jack threatened to hurt Michael.
<i>I didn't know what else to do.</i>
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.
I promise.
[No Audible Dialogue]
You down for this?
<i>Cut the power, bust open the side door,
wait for you to come through the front.
- Everything by the numbers.
- By the numbers.
- You don't seem convinced.
- We screw this up, we're both dead men.
Well, we better not screw it up then.

<i>Oh, Jack?</i>
- <i>Wake up!</i>
- What?
- <i>It is okay if I still call you Jack, right?</i>
- Barker?
Is that you, Barker? You stinkin' punk!
- I'm gonna burn you for this!
- I told you this was gonna blow up in our faces!

Kid, listen to me! You're makin'

- <i>Would you just chill out?</i>
You said he's been doin' this
home invasion thing for the last five years.
- So what?
- <i>So what?</i>
<i>Open your eyes, dumb-ass!</i>
<i>Look around!</i>
There's more loot here than we're ever
gonna find in any cul-de-sac in the suburbs.
- Ain't that right, Jack?
- You clowns are robbing <i>me?</i>
That's what this is all about?
You're robbing me?
It stings, don't it, Jack?
<i>Just like it must've stung...</i>
<i>Bobby Harmon...</i>
when you killed him.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Why are you talkin' about Harmon?
Let's just do this and get out of here!
- A little change of plans, Pat.
- What are you talkin' about?
You see, I'm not exactly
who I pretend to be.
The truth is, I've never been arrested before,
but you will be.
I'll make sure they put you away for aiding
and abetting in the murder of Bobby Harmon.
- Kill him, Pat!
- Who are you?
I'm still tryin' to figure that one out.
But as for you? It's over.
- I don't think so.
- Are you gonna shoot me?
- I'll do it. I swear.
- Go ahead.
- Do it!
- [Clicks]
[Angry Grunt]
Back off, Barker!
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.
Well, looks like
it's just you and me, Jack.
What do you want from me?
Did you kill Bobby Harmon?
You're gonna rot in prison, Barker.
- Answer my question!
- Go to hell!
Okay, fine.
I'm just gonna have to take it up with
your four-legged friends in the next room.
Hey, what are you doin'?
Let's just see how much you
really love those little guys.
Actually, I'll start with the little one.
[Whimpering]
Junior? Hey, Barker,
what the hell are you doin'?
- Junior? Here, Junior!
- Barker, don't hurt that dog!
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>
- <i>[Dog Whining]</i>
No! You son of a bitch!
You killed my dog?
Well, are you ready to answer
my question now, Jack?
Look, you leave
Big Daddy alone, huh?
Well, Big Daddy's gonna fry
unless you answer my question.
You hurt that dog, man,
I will cut your heart out!
- All right, Jack. Have it your way.
- No. Barker?
- All right, Big Daddy. You're up.
- Barker! No, wait! Barker!
All right, I did it! I did it!
You did what?
You... did... what?
I killed Bobby Harmon.
I made it look like it was a robbery.
How many other home invasion robberies
using parolees were you involved with?
- L-
- [Shouts] How many?
Uh, 10, 12.
<i>Come on. Take this blindfold off me,</i>
<i>will you, man?</i>
- Sure thing, Jack.
- <i>[Dog Whining]</i>
What the hell? Hey!
<i>I heard my dogs.</i>
- I heard you shoot!
- What, this?
Neat trick, huh? Oh, one other thing.
- Look at this!
- [Tape: Dog Barking]
Huh?
<i>[Dogs Barking In Rhythm.</i>
<i>"Jingle Bells"]</i>
- <i>[Continues]</i>
- Merry Christmas, <i>Jack.</i>
I'll get you, Barker! Damn you!
<i>[Barking Continues]</i>
- Barker!
- <i>[Stops]</i>
<i>Pardon me, Mrs. Stamatis, but the doctor</i>
<i>thinks you should say good-bye now.</i>
- I don't think I can do this.
- I can go in with you.
No, no.
L- I need to be alone with him.
But Nicholas should be here.
He needs to say good-bye to him.
Hi.
- Hey.
- Hey.
It's all right. Don't be afraid.
- I'm not.
- [Sniffles]
I love you... so much.
Always.
It just doesn't seem fair.
We have so much to do.
We have so much more to share.
Shh.
We will be...
together again, I know it.
<i>Come here.</i> Come here.
- Oh, my baby.
- [Quiet Crying]
Where's Nick, huh?
Oh.
<i>Sorry I'm late.</i>
- I'm here, Dad.
- Nick.
- I'm here.
- <i>Hey, buddy.</i>
Hey.
<i>[Monitor. Steady Beeping]</i>
<i>[Bell Tolling]</i>
"Thank you" will just never be enough.
I'm glad I was of some comfort to you.
What now?
Well, I go home and try to get on
with the rest of my life.
A good life.
Good-bye, Sydney.
Until we meet again.
I never thought I could feel
more alone than I did...
when I heard my father was dying.
- I was wrong.
- Time's a great healer.
Time. Is that how you got over
losing your family?
I will never get over that...
not as long as I live.
My office number at the university...
if you ever-
if you ever want to talk.
Who shall I say I am,
if your assistant asks?
You can say that you're my friend.
[Engine Starts]
<i>That's a pretty good start.</i>
Well, a man can't ask
for more than an opportunity.
And I owe any chance I have
of knowing my son to you, Jarod.
Well, everyone deserves to have a family.
Jarod?
Didn't I teach you how to tie a tie?
Yes.
Yes, you did.
<i>[Clacking]</i>
[Beeping]
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.</i>
I'm so happy to see you again.
Hello, Mother, Father.
It's very good
to see you again.
Sydney, I can't decide
what to say.
- And this tie isn't working.
- Jarod...
just try and relax.
Just please tell me
what to say.
Trust your feelings...
and you'll be fine.
<i>[Beeping]</i>
<i>[Mr. Lyle]</i>
<i>So how much did the little thief get?</i>
Sixty million,
give or take.
<i>Considering what was sitting
in the account...
Jarod could have
hit us worse.
You know,
murder happens...
extortion
is sometimes necessary...
but theft-
simply taking for the taking-
has always escaped me as
an admirable criminal pursuit.
Little bitter about
your car being stolen?
Ten miles on the odometer.
Three hours filling out
police reports...
five pages of insurance
company fine print-
I know it's a little late to stop the happy
fellows at the chop shop this time...
but I saw this and I immediately
thought of you.
<i>Consider it a little
preventative medicine.
Actually, with the $2,000
alarm system...
that the dealer
all but threw in...
I still hope to get
my car back in one piece.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Now there's a good target.</i>
Once you try
one of these puppies...
you'll never go back.
It takes a lot of jack to supply
the kind of order I'm talking about.
Who's funding you?
Some people
I used to work for.
I'm talking about 60 SAMs.
If they can afford 'em,
I can find 'em.
You get 'em to my place
in Venezuela, we're in business.
There's no business
like the arms business.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already</i>
<i>demonstrating more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
Sixty million dollars-
What are you up to, Jarod?
<i>Mmm. Actually,</i>
<i>it's 58,990,620.</i>
It's not every day we get ripped off
to the exact penny.
Once again, Officer,
it's a black...
500 SL convertible...
license plate, LYLE-1.
Well, it didn't just vanish.
Found it. Thank you.
Mm. Have a nice day.
Jarod.
How goes the hunt,
Broots?
Well, Jarod's routed the money through
a maze of phony cover accounts-
nearly 100 of them so far-
but I'm still tracking it.
Look, I hate to bring the room down,
but we've been here before.
It'll take us three weeks
to run Jarod's little maze...
and by then
he'll be long gone.
Not this time.
Right, Broots?
I created a new
computer tracing program-
type of digital encryption.
I marked the Centre's funds
electronically-
like a bank marks cash-
and this program lets me
follow the money wherever it goes.
[Chuckles]
I, uh-
I call it "The Hound."
Too bad it doesn't work
for cars though.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
<i>Come on.
You're making me feel like McGwire.
[Grunts]
Whoo!
<i>Three-bagger.</i>
<i>Come on. Put some heat on that ball.
[Groans]
I'm sorry, Mr. Blake.
It slipped.
Your turn.
- <i>[Man Groans]</i>
- <i>[Bat Clatters]</i>
[Man #2]
You all right?
I guess that one
got away from you.
Landed right where
I threw it.
Hmm.
Just stack 'em four high.
The missiles.
All 60 of them.
- I'll have my man cut you a check.
- Check?
What are you talking about?
That wasn't part of the deal.
I guess you should have
covered that...
before you brought
your weapons here.
You know something,
Mr. Blake?
In their current state
they couldn't take out a Tonka truck.
The guidance systems
are dead...
and I've got the only brain
that can program them.
I guess you should have covered that
before I brought them here.
<i>Cash-
wired to my account.
Half now,
half when they can fly.
Ryan,
I'm in a meeting here.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Ryan was just playing, Daddy.
Tuck in that shirt.
Oh. Yes, sir.
- Emma.
- Come on, kids. Your dad's working.
Let's get ready for lunch.
Your children
are very well behaved.
How long is it gonna take
to program my missiles?
I'll need to be here
for two weeks.
- You got 72 hours.
- We're talking about 60 missiles here.
<i>It would take an entire team</i>
<i>of specialists...</i>
to program those missiles
in 72 hours.
- I'll give you Logan and Dobbs.
- I don't think you understand-
No, I understand perfectly.
You got 72 hours.
<i>You stay in the guest house. I want you</i>
<i>here until those missiles are programmed.</i>
Seventy-two hours then.
Guidance telemetry...
needs to be downloaded
into each missile-
one at a time.
Which means we will
be working shifts around the clock...
if we're going to meet
the deadline.
<i>[Man] Considering Mr. Blake</i>
<i>already has buyers lined up...</i>
there's not much choice,
is there?
I'm going to get some air.
Get started, Mr. Dobbs.
<i>[Man On Radio]</i>
<i>Inter-perimeter clear.</i>
<i>[Clink]</i>
You know, if you center
the tail- like this-
it flies a lot further.
Thanks.
Who are you?
I'm working for your dad.
<i>[Girl]</i>
<i>Do you know if"angel"is G-E-L or G-A-L?</i>
- G-E-L.
- Thanks.
- Jarod.
- I'm Rebecca.
- Hi, Rebecca.
- Thanks, Jarod.
What are you writing?
A letter... to my mom.
I write lots of them.
- Your mom's not here?
- <i>No.</i>
She's...
right here, see?
- She's very pretty.
- Don't tell my dad about the picture.
- I'm not supposed to have it.
- I promise.
<i>Our mom's in heaven.</i>
She's an angel.
Thank you for your patience.
It's really been a madhouse here today.
- <i>[Child] Mommy, Mommy!</i>
- It's okay.
Oh! I am so sorry.
I swear, that's the fifth glass
I've dumped today.
Spilling a glass of water
isn't the end of the world.
Losing your children is.
What do you know
about my kids?
I know that you lost them...
and you won't be alive
until you get them back.
<i>Wendy, my name is Jarod.</i>
<i>I heard about you...</i>
and your story.
I know you don't have much reason
to trust people right now...
but I would like to help you
get your children back.
Why would you help me?
Let's just say
I know the feeling.
It's been three years
since-
I don't even know
where they are.
Not long after the court
granted me custody...
my ex-husband
stole Ryan and Rebecca.
I have spent every last penny,
every waking moment, searching...
and I'm still without them.
They could be anywhere
in the world by now.
Leave that to me.
Desmond is a monster.
When the judge granted me
full custody...
Desmond was furious.
I saw hatred in his eyes
like I have never seen.
You're talking about going
after his number one possession.
And that is exactly how
he sees our children, as a possession.
- He sounds like a real family man.
- He wasn't always like that.
Now... he would kill...
to keep me away
from our children.
Wendy. Let me help you.
Who are you?
I'm someone...
who believes that children
shouldn't be stolen...
from a mother who loves them.
<i>[Rebecca]</i>
<i>We miss our mom.</i>
She died three years ago...
in a car crash.
<i>Jarod, there's been</i>
<i>an accident.</i>
The plane
your parents were on-
it crashed.
There were no survivors.
<i>[Emma]</i>
<i>Ryan, Rebecca, in the house.</i>
<i>Come on, in the house.
I don't know what your business
with Mr. Blake is...
but from now on,
you stay away from those kids.
Those children are lucky to have
someone like you watching out for them.
- [Whirring, Beeping]
- <i>[Keys Clacking]</i>
<i>[Dobbs]</i>
<i>See you in 60.</i>
<i>[Woman Speaking Spanish On P.A.]</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Wendy.</i>
Oh, Jarod.
I got here as quickly
as I could.
Just, uh-Just tell me
that my children are okay.
- They're fine.
- [Sighs] Thank goodness.
When I got your messages
saying to come as soon as possible...
I didn't know what to think.
I didn't expect to hear from you
for at least a week.
I had to push
the timetable up.
Desmond has only
given me 72 hours.
- Is that enough time?
- [Sighs] It'll have to be.
Just tell me that you are sure
that Ryan and Rebecca are okay.
See for yourself.
I took this yesterday.
- I never thought I'd see 'em again.
- You will.
- They ride horses.
- <i>[Jarod] Lessons every day at 5.00.</i>
Unfortunately, Desmond
is always with them-
- along with his armed guard.
- Well, how are we gonna save 'em?
This is a layout
of your ex-husband's compound.
Ryan and Rebecca's rooms
are in the main house.
I'm working on circumventing the
security cameras and the alarm system...
so that I have free access
inside the house.
Once I've accomplished that...
then we'll make our move.
You'll be waiting in a car
outside of this gate.
When?
Before my cover
with Desmond is blown.
- Soon. Very soon.
- [Sighs]
Oh, I hope we're doing
the right thing.
It's just, uh...
hard for me to even imagine
being with them again.
Trust your feelings.
You'll do just fine.
[Sighs]
There's something you have to know.
Desmond told your children...
that you died in a car crash.
I just-
I don't know if I'm gonna
make it through this.
Wendy, you can't
fall apart on me now.
It may be a shock for them
at first...
but your children need you.
They need a mother.
Trust me.
- I have to get back to the compound.
- Oh.
Jarod-
Oh, just thank you.
- [Chuckles]
- Thank you.
You can thank me
when you're back with your children.
The Hound did it.
Gee, Broots, come on in.
It found the money
thatJarod stole.
He routed it
through 506 bogus accounts...
and it ended up here.
"Raul Zenega-
real estate developer...
- <i>Mexico City. "
- That may be what it says...
but Mr. Zenega's
an arms dealer.
And you know this because?
Let's just say he and I
have a history together-
back when I was still
building my résumé.
What would Jarod be doing
with 60 million dollars' worth of weapons?
<i>Sounds like a question</i>
<i>for your pal Zenega.</i>
So what happened
to your pitcher?
Disabled list.
You wanted to see me?
About a month ago,
someone tried to blow up my car.
Luckily I wasn't in it...
<i>but lately...</i>
I've been a little
mistrustful of strangers.
I went by your room
last night.
You weren't in it.
- I didn't realize I had a curfew.
- My house, my rules.
I went for a walk.
And I'm supposed
to believe that?
Look, Mr. Desmond, I'm not
here to blow up your car.
I'm here to program your missiles,
get my money...
and get the hell out of here.
- [Fence Rattles]
- [Mutters Angrily]
<i>[Dobbs]</i>
<i>Twenty-three down.</i>
Great.
Thirty-seven more to go.
[Beeping]
- <i>[Jarod] Damn it.</i>
- What was that?
- Must have blown a circuit.
- I'll go reset it.
<i>No, I'll go.</i>
<i>Get that casing fitted.</i>
<i>[Man Over Radio]</i>
<i>Rear gate secure.</i>
<i>[Radio Chatter, Indistinct]</i>
What do you think
you're doing?
I was hungry, so I thought
I would grab a sandwich.
Well, I'm afraid
that this area is off-limits.
Well, the old stomach was growling.
What can you do?
That's a very pretty
medallion you're wearing.
- What saint is it?
- I don't know.
It was a gift.
And now I have to insist
that you leave.
I don't allow Mr. Blake's associates
in this part of the house.
Tell me something, Emma.
If you have such a problem
with Mr. Blake's associates...
why do you work for him?
It's really none
of your concern.
It must be very difficult
to fill her shoes.
One doesn't replace a mother.
I'm sure...
wherever she is...
she's very grateful to you.
[Panting]
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Mmm. Work those quads.</i>
You must be Raul Zenega.
<i>Ay.</i>
A beautiful young lady
has caught me at a disadvantage.
- Please don't get up.
- <i>[Laughs]</i>
<i>[Mr. Lyle]</i>
Hola, Raul.
- [Groans]
- Little out of shape, are we?
Please.
Whatever you want,
I'll give it to you. Anything.
- <i>[Groans]</i>
- You obviously made
quite an impression last time you met.
But to my credit...
very little scarring.
<i>My legs, my legs.</i>
<i>I can't hold it.</i>
[Groans]
Psst. This man gave you...
sixty million dollars
of our money.
I'd like to know
what he got in return.
Missile launchers-
laser-guided SAMs.
Sixty of them.
- [Squealing]
- [Groans]
Twenty-second time-out,
Raul.
Where'd he take them?
<i>All I know</i>
<i>is the name ofhis buyer.</i>
It's Desmond Blake.
Tell us where to find Blake...
and you keep your knees.
I would never lie to you.
<i>I swear.</i>
Not after last time.
[Groaning]
- <i>[Groaning]</i>
- Gravity's a bitch.
- [Knocking]
- Wendy?
Wendy?
Wendy!
Wendy.
<i>Oh, no.</i>
The riding school.
Good form, Ryan.
Keep working on it.
<i>[Chattering, Indistinct]</i>
That's not bad, Son. You're getting better.
You're getting better.
- <i>[Ryan] Where's my plane?</i>
- <i>I think it's over there.</i>
Hi, Daddy.
How am I doing?
Pull your horse in a bit.
Straighten your back, hands higher.
<i>That's it.</i>
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>
<i>Don't give me that look. The only reason</i>
<i>I tell you what you're doing wrong...</i>
<i>is so you can do it better</i>
<i>next time.</i>
- <i>[Radio Playing]</i>
- [Woman Speaking Spanish]
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!
- Bring it!
- <i>I think I saw a lady. I think it was Mom.</i>
Let's go. Let's go. In the car.
In the car. Everyone.
Everybody, get in the car.
Son, get in the car!
Let's go. Let's go.
Beat it. Go!
- <i>[Horn Honking]</i>
- <i>[Blake] Emma! Emma!</i>
But it was Mom.
I saw her.
Ryan, you did not see your mother.
It's impossible.
- Inside, both of you!
- But what if he's right?
Maybe it was all a mistake. Maybe
she wasn't even in the car that crashed.
<i>She could still be alive.</i>
- What if my parents weren't even on that plane?
- <i>Jarod...</i>
denial is a very...
human response
to a devastating loss...
<i>but this is a reality</i>
<i>that must be faced...</i>
no matter how painful
that may be.
<i>[Blake]</i>
<i>Did I tell you?</i>
I said inside the house,
both of you, now.
But, Dad, if Mom's still alive,
she's gotta be looking for us.
<i>It was her. She looks</i>
<i>just like she did in Rebecca's picture.</i>
What picture?
<i>Give me that picture,</i>
<i>young lady.</i>
I said give me that book.
Why?
Why do you kids
do this to me?
<i>Do you know how difficult</i>
<i>it was losing your mother?</i>
<i>How it tears me up inside...</i>
to see her face?
- <i>But, Dad, if it was Mom-</i>
- Your mother is dead!
This does nothing
but cause me pain.
Ryan,
maybe the reason...
that you saw your mom
is because you miss her so much.
Your heart wants
to see her so badly...
that your eyes
went along with it.
<i>Emma, get these two packed.</i>
<i>We're leaving first thing in the morning.</i>
- Leaving for how long?
- I said get them packed!
<i>Come on.
- <i>Come on.</i>
- The morning? Are you crazy?
There's no way I can have
the missiles done by the morning.
And I want to know what
you were doing out by the stables.
I was trying to tell you
that we're running behind.
Dobbs and Logan
aren't cutting it.
No, they're cutting it.
It's you who I'm concerned about.
I'm thinking it may be time
to just blow your brains out.
I'm the only one that knows
where the memory chips are.
<i>You need me.</i>
Unless, of course,
you don't want your missiles.
<i>Jarod, I've got a brain too...</i>
and it's telling me
not to trust you.
- <i>[Jarod] What were you thinking?</i>
- I wanted to see them.
- <i>[Jarod] What were you thinking?</i>
- I wanted to see them.
I was just losing my mind knowing
that they were just a few blocks away.
Well, now Desmond is spooked.
He's taking the kids
and flying out first thing in the morning.
- What? Where are they going?
- He wouldn't tell me.
I have to get them
out tonight.
You park the car by the gate
at 11:00 p.m., like we had planned...
<i>and you sit there</i>
<i>with the lights off and you wait.</i>
- Can we trust Emma?
- Absolutely.
<i>All right. I will create</i>
<i>some kind of diversion.</i>
Then I will
get the children out.
In the meantime,
don't go out that door...
and don't so much
as peek out those windows.
<i>Desmond's men</i>
<i>will be looking for you.</i>
Ryan didn't even
recognize me.
[Sighs]
Of course he did.
It's all he could think about.
Rebecca too.
She carried this with her
all along.
11:00 p.m. Sharp.
Wendy, I'll get them out.
I promise.
<i>[Broots] The name Raul Zenega</i>
<i>gave you? Desmond Blake?</i>
- I think I found him.
- You think.
Remember the Centre account
thatJarod stole the 60 million from?
It just received
a very serious deposit-
- a wire for 40 million bucks.
- Where did it come from?
Jarod's buyer-
Desmond Blake-
from a small town in Venezuela.
I hope you brought
your sunscreen.
<i>[Men Chattering]</i>
Emma.
I need to speak to you.
- There's not much time.
- Time for what?
Time to get Rebecca and Ryan
out of here and into their mother's arms.
What are you talking about?
Do I have to remind you that
Wendy Dawson died three years ago?
<i>That is what Desmond</i>
<i>always wanted you to believe...</i>
but I am telling you,
she's very much alive...
and in a hotel
not ten minutes from here.
You know what?
I don't believe you.
[Sighs]
That medallion around your neck-
It's a St. Anne's medal.
<i>Wendy gave it to you</i>
<i>the day her son was born...</i>
<i>to thank you for being</i>
<i>like a sister to her.</i>
[Scoffs]
Desmond could have told you that one.
When you put it around your neck,
she made you promise...
that if anything ever happened
to her children...
you would devote your life
to raising them.
Desmond couldn't
have told me that.
He wasn't even there
that day his son was born.
Oh, my God, Wendy.
But I saw the casket
go into the grave.
You never saw
inside the casket, did you?
I was- I was in New York
when Desmond called me...
about the news
that Wendy had died.
<i>And I'd been divorced</i>
<i>for a couple of months...</i>
and he said that the kids needed me
desperately, so I flew here straightaway.
<i>She was buried the next day.</i>
Wendy had no other family,
so-
[Laughs]
Desmond said that he wanted
to bury her here...
so that the kids
could be close to her.
What lie have I been part of?
Be a part of the truth.
Help me.
<i>Help those children.</i>
<i>Come on.
[Beeping]
<i>Call the general now-
and get someone to put this out.
[Clamoring]
- [Beeping]
- [Whirring]
Ryan.
- [Beeping]
- [Whirring]
Rebecca. Rebecca!
- Where are they? Where are the children?
- I don't know.
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- Jarod?
- The plan has changed, Wendy.
Get out of there. Go.
- Wh-Where are the children?
- They're gone.
Desmond took your children
to another part of the compound...
but they're okay.
Because he saw me at the riding stables.
[Groans]
- I can't risk anything happening to the children.
- Nothing will, I promise you.
You don't know Desmond.
He'll do anything
to keep them away from me.
- I mean, anything.
- Wendy, calm down. Now listen to me.
Go to the airport and park
at the south end of the hangar and wait.
- This is a mistake.
- I was stolen from my mother when I was a child.
I never wanted her
to stop looking for me...
even if it put me
in danger.
Wendy, never give up.
The children need you.
[Sighs]
I'll get them out.
[Electronic Whine]
[Beeping]
Here you go, Dawkins.
- The SAMs are loaded and ready to go.
- That's great.
It's been a rough
couple of days.
Keeping a family together
can be very difficult.
- Mr. Blake?
- Hmm?
There's been a problem.
Dawkins is feeling really ill.
- Who's Dawkins?
- He's my driver.
<i>I could drive you.</i>
Hey, it's the least I can do
for a paying customer.
What the hell.
An iron gate's not gonna
save you this time, Jarod.
<i>[Blake]</i>
<i>What's the problem? Let's go.</i>
Emma, aren't those two
parked over there the ones...
that were questioning you about
the children when you were in town?
- Uh, yeah, yeah. That's them.
- What questions?
I should have mentioned it
to you earlier...
but I, uh-
I didn't want to bother you.
They just seemed
really interested...
<i>in Ryan and Rebecca,</i>
<i>that's all.</i>
<i>I told them nothing,</i>
<i>of course.</i>
We've got a couple
of trespassers at the gate.
Make sure they don't
give us any trouble or follow us.
Then you can let them go.
- He's gotta come out sometime.
- I got a bad feeling.
Move it! Go! Go!
[Blake]
Okay, kids, let's <i>go.</i> Come on, let's shake.
[Beeps]
<i>Unlock the door.</i>
<i>Hey.</i>
What the hell are you doing?
Just making sure
I have a captive audience.
Oh, Desmond,
I hope you don't mind...
but I sent
one of those ahead.
- I thought I would do a little target practice.
- [Electronic Whine]
Wait till Logan and Dobbs
get here. You're a dead man.
<i>The key word being "when."</i>
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
[Groans]
Oh, man.
You have wonderful taste
in weapons, Desmond.
Who the hell are you?
Why are you doing this, Jarod?
So you would know
what it feels like...
to have everything
that you care about in the world...
ripped away from you-
Like you did to your ex-wife.
Like you did
to Ryan and Rebecca.
My kids? What do my kids
have to do with this?
Oh, they have everything
to do with this.
- I know what's best for them.
- Oh, really?
Like telling them that the one person
that they love in the world is dead?
That woman doesn't deserve them.
They're mine!
You make it sound like
having children is like owning-
well, a missile.
- [Panting]
- [Whirring]
No! No! No!
No! No!
You know, on second thought...
blowing you up is too easy.
I've got something...
that will get you
where you live.
<i>Emma, bring the children.</i>
<i>[Blake] What the hell's</i>
<i>going on, Jarod? What are you doing?</i>
- <i>Ryan. Rebecca.</i>
- I have someone here
who has missed you very much-
who loves you more
than everything in the whole world.
Don't be afraid.
Just trust your heart.
Oh, Wendy.
No! No!
<i>No!</i>
<i>No, don't listen! No!</i>
- <i>Come on!</i>
- <i>[Ryan] Mommy!</i>
- <i>I can't believe it.</i>
- <i>[Rebecca] We missed you.</i>
- <i>You're actually here.</i>
- <i>[Blake] Wendy! Wendy, don't!</i>
Mom, oh! Oh, my God.
<i>[Wendy]</i>
<i>Oh, look at you.</i>
Emma! Thank you so much.
Get on the plane.
<i>[Blake]</i>
<i>Rebecca!</i>
Ryan!
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Oh, Desmond.</i>
You know...
the Venezuelan authorities
were very interested...
when I told them that arms dealing
was going on right under their very noses.
- You son of a bitch.
- <i>They'll be here within the hour.</i>
F.Y. <i>I. -
All this time I haven't
been arming your missiles.
I've been disarming them.
<i>Now</i> they couldn't
take out a Tonka truck.
Rebecca!
Ryan!
Rebecca! You're my kids!
<i>Come on. Let's go.
Jarod! You-
[Laughing]
You've given me
my life back.
Take good care of them.
- Let them take care of you.
- I will.
Oh. Here's a little something
to get your new life started-
from Desmond.
From Desmond?
Well, I helped out
a little bit.
Oh! Oh, my gosh.
- Good luck.
- Jarod.
I hope your parents
find you one day...
so that you can feel
what I'm feeling right now.
Thanks.
Thank you.
- [Whispering] Bye.
- Bye.
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>Dear Mom. I miss you more than ever.</i>
[Thinking]
Every day I think of you.
I make myself remember
your face...
and Dad's face.
I remember everything I can...
so I'll know you
when we see each other again.
- <i>[Chattering, Laughter]</i>

[Sydney] It was your grandfather's when
he was in the ranks of the Belgian Infantry.
- It's beautiful, Sydney.
- It said it kept him from losing his way.
- I'm glad to know you have it now.
- <i>[Boy] Nicholas!</i>
<i>Come on!
You promised you'd read to me!
- I have to go. Thanks for the gift, Sydney.
- Oh, Nicholas?
- [Boy] Nicholas! This way!
- Don't call me <i>Sydney.</i> Call me-
- [Line Clicks, Beeps Off]
- Dad.
[Engine Cranking]
<i>Come on. Read to me!
<i>Green Eggs and Ham,</i>

- What is that?
- It's a compass.

Now, where were we?
Is that your mama?
- Yes.
- Where's your daddy?
[Indistinct Shouts]
<i>[Gunshots]</i>
- All right, back inside!
- <i>[Scattered Shouts]</i>
Stay with your mother.
Leave 'em alone.
They're teachers.

- <i>In other breaking news, four volunteer teachers...</i>

The educators were abducted
by a group believed to be members...

- <i>[Jarod] Nicholas.</i>
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
are following all the leads they can.
At this point, they're gravely concerned
for the safety of these hostages.
A bird saturated in crude oil.
I guess afterJarod killed and basted it,
he forgot to put it on the grill.
- Jarod doesn't take life. He's making a statement.
- Save the swallow?
- Somebody call me when
you figure out what it means.
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- I think it's sad.
- Devastating.

- [Woman] Sydney.
Michelle. Michelle?
- What's wrong?
- Oh, Sydney. They took Nicholas.
- They took him away.
- Who?
- Who took our son?
- They don't know for sure.
They don't-They don't even know
if he's alive, Sydney.
- What are we gonna do, Sydney?
- Michelle.
- We'll get him back.
- Yes.

<i>[Man #2]</i>

<i>[Faint Radio Chatter]</i>
All right, gentlemen. Listen up.
We're gonna pick up the trail
right here where they were abducted...
and hope we all get lucky.
Now this country is
a real throwback in time.
We really don't know what to expect from
the locals, but I do not want another Ruby Ridge-
<i>which is why we brought in</i>
<i>Special AgentJarod Miner.</i>
Miner's a tracking expert in this region
and well-versed in the people.
- He's gonna help us find the teachers.
- And bring them back... alive.
All right, gentlemen. Pick up your equipment,
and let's move out.
[Agents Chattering]
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out,
I've spent every moment searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
[Miss Parker]
What was Nicholas doing there?
He's a volunteer fighting illiteracy.
- Broots, will you cover for me while I'm gone?
- I'll do anything I can, Syd.
- Lyle. What about Lyle?
- Let me worry about Eddie Haskell.
Sydney, don't do anything crazy.
Parker, they took my son!
Hi, I'm Agent Cory with the A.T.F.
- Have you ladies seen anything?
- Mm-mmm.
- No.
- Just tell me what you saw.
- I didn't see nothin'.
<i>Did you see anything?</i>
<i>[Sniffles]</i>
I mean, you must have seen something, right?
<i>Can you tell me anything? Could-
Was it something we said?
They're afraid to talk to us.
- Something has them spooked.
- <i>So "unspook"them.</i>
<i>What the hell is this?</i>
<i>It's the trademark...</i>
<i>of the Appalachian Freedom Militia.</i>
<i>We raided their compound two months ago,</i>
<i>confiscated a stockpile of weapons.</i>
<i>The A.F.M. 's leader</i>
<i>is a man named Eldridge Hailey.</i>
This abduction-
- It was a retaliatory gesture.
- Hailey's even more unstable than his followers.
<i>We're talking about bombings,</i>
<i>church arson, attacking federal officers.</i>
<i>You'd think these locals would</i>
<i>bend over backwards to help us stop these guys.</i>
A rattlesnake- It uses its rattle
to warn its victims when it's going to attack.
What, this is Hailey's threat
if they talk?
<i>They won't put their families in danger-</i>
<i>not for us.</i>
<i>[Snake Rattles]</i>
<i>Green Eggs and Ham,</i> Sam-l-Am.
Hi.
You don't have to be afraid.
My name is Jarod.
Nicholas gave it to me.
- Do you know who this is?
- Nicholas's mama.
Do you know where Nicholas is?
A man took him- took 'em all-
up in the hills.
It helps you find your way
when you get lost.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>There must be something we can do, Agent Swik.</i>
The search party is already in the field.
But there are hundreds of square miles
of mountainous terrain...
where the A.F.M. Could be holding your son.
I want to help with the search, please.
I understand your concern. But until we can
pinpoint the hostages' exact location...
we have to be patient.
I'm sorry. I wish I could do more for you.
Sydney.
Don't worry, Michelle.
We will find our son.
[Sobs]
- Do you think they'll-you know.
- Don't even think that.
<i>Hey, have you ever been to Flannery's?</i>
The coffee shop near campus?
<i>Hey, get back over there.</i>
<i>When we get back on campus,</i>
<i>I'll take you there, I promise.</i>
- [Gun Cocks]
- Now everybody ain't gonna make it, son.
And the ones
that don't listen go first.
So you get over there,
you sit down, and you shut up.
<i>Even though sometimes it feels</i>
<i>like my thumb is still attached...</i>
there is something very streamlined
about a four-fingered hand-
the way the palm flows
seamlessly into the wrist.
It's sleek.
<i>Of course, if you're not thinking,</i>
<i>holding a cup of coffee can be hell.</i>
[Wheezing Chuckle]
Oh. I found Jarod.
He's working at a-
[Clearing Throat]
An oil refinery
near San Juan Capistrano.
That's where the swallows migrate.
Yeah, there was a foreman
who I.D.'d his photo.
And Miss Parker?
- Uh, she's out of the off-
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
Yes?
Excuse me, Mr. Lyle, but it's urgent.
She's out of the office.
- <i>[Paper Rustling]</i>
- Well...
I'm going to Capistrano.
<i>And I want you near your phone</i>
<i>in case I need assistance. Clear?</i>
Oh, yes, sir.
Talk to you soon.
What about Lyle?
He's, um, gone to California.
Dance, puppet, dance.
<i>Please, Miss Parker, don't make me lie</i>
<i>like that again. I think I'm getting an ulcer.</i>
- Try warm milk, shot of bourbon.
- Okay. Right.
What happens when Lyle realizes
that we sent him on a boondoggle?
It doesn't matter as long as Sydney
brings his son home alive.
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>
- Beth Swik.
- <i>[Thunder Rumbling]</i>
- I should be out there looking for him myself.
- Where would you start?
- I have his picture. Someone might have seen him.
- <i>[Phone Rings]</i>
Yeah?
Sydney, we have to be patient.
I have never been able
to help in his life, Michelle.
Now when he needs me,
I'm just sitting here-
patiently!
<i>Come on.
Take a walk with me.
<i>Come on.
I'm sorry, Michelle.
It's just this helplessness-
I know the feeling...
all too well.
When Nicholas was born,
the doctors discovered a ventricular disorder.
They said that if it wasn't repaired immediately
that he was going to die.
He was only a few days old
when he had the operation.
It was a... five and a half-hour
open-heart surgery.
I sat in the waiting room, all alone...
trying to prepare myself
for the possibility...
that my baby-
of my baby-
[Sighs]
Leaving me.
And now it's all coming back, that feeling
of having to prepare myself all over again.
You shouldn't have
gone through it alone.
You should have called me.
Oh, Sydney.
I disappeared from your life because
the Centre threatened to kill you if I didn't.
It was hard enough
thinking of burying my child...
let alone the love of my life.
- I'm glad you called this time.
- So am I.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Sir, pull over.</i>
<i>We're getting a satellite feed</i>
<i>on the remote from Eldridge Hailey.</i>
Patch this through
to A.T.F. Headquarters immediately.
<i>The feed is going through</i>
<i>to headquarters, sir.</i>
There's a satellite feed
coming in from the kidnappers.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Nicholas is alive, Michelle.</i>
- He's alive.
- Yeah.
To whom it may concern:
<i>If you want to see these</i>
<i>so-called educators again...</i>
you will wire one million dollars
into an offshore bank account.
<i>Hold up the access number.</i>
<i>Now these funds will be</i>
<i>considered as reparations...</i>
for your violation
of our God-given rights...
<i>under the Second, the First</i>
<i>and the Fourth Amendments.</i>
<i>And if I do not receive word</i>
<i>of this transaction by dawn...</i>
further actions will be taken...
as demonstrated.
No.
- Oh, Sydney!
- [Gunshot]
- God Bless America.
- [Static]
[Whimpering]
<i>I'm afraid it's not good, Sydney.</i>
Uh, Eldridge Hailey started
the Appalachian Freedom Militia...
while serving 10 years
for voluntary manslaughter.
His first act after his release
was a bombing that killed 12 people.
He got off on a technicality.
Ever since, it's been extortion,
murder, kidnapping-
- Sydney, what's going on down there?
- We're not even sure if he's-
Listen to me, Sydney.
You have to believe he's alive.
You do whatever it takes
to bring your son home.
- Why are you doing this for me?
- Because you'd do the same.
<i>[Receiver Clatters]</i>
- [Beeping]
- We've got a partial triangulation...
on A.F.M.'s satellite signal.
It's about 12 miles southwest of here,
right in the heart of the national forest.
I suggest that we get within
a few miles on this fire road here...
and then we proceed on foot
to avoid being detected.
Well, we've got
three hours until dawn.
- Let's get it done.
- <i>[Agent] All right.</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
- <i>[Thunder Rumbling]</i>
- <i>Okay, we're right on it.</i>
Is that where they are?
Is that where they're holding my son?
<i>I'm not at liberty to discuss those types of specifics.</i>
<i>There are contingency plans-</i>
My son may have been shot,
and you're talking about contingency plans?
- Why don't you tell us where he is?
- I'm doing everything l-
- I got the governor's publicity aide on line two.
- Not now.
- Ma'am, the governor
wants to make a statement-
- Not now!
- [Ringing]
- Get the message?
No more games.
No more.
- Come, Michelle.
- <i>Doctor?</i>
Doctor, where are you going?
<i>[Miss Parker] How will you know</i>
<i>where the kidnappers are, Sydney?</i>
<i>[Sydney] I took the coordinates</i>
<i>from the A. T.F. Office. It's a start.</i>
<i>Parker, I need you</i>
<i>to do something for me.</i>
- What?
- Hailey is demanding a million-dollars' ransom.
Liquidate my assets and wire it
into a designated bank account.
<i>It probably won't be enough,</i>
<i>but maybe he'll take it.</i>
No. Syd, I got a better idea.
- Let the Centre pick up the tab on this one.
- The Centre?
Well, they're responsible
for you not knowing Nicholas.
The least they can do
is pay to get him back.
<i>You think Hailey will keep up</i>
<i>his end of the deal?</i>
I'm going to find him
and make sure he does.
Sydney, you don't want
to take this man on by yourself.
I have spent my whole life standing by
while other people did their jobs-
<i>no matter who it hurt-</i>
<i>without protecting those who needed my help.</i>
Not this time, Parker.
We need to go there.
Miss Parker, Sydney asked us
to stay out of it.
I understand a parent's need to do
whatever it takes to ensure their child's safety.
- But how does Sydney getting
himself killed accomplish that?
- Well, maybe he's not alone.
- Maybe Sydney has help.
- Jarod.
Why do you say that?
Well, before Sydney left,
he-he was at his keyboard.
E-mail toJarod?
Find out.
Kerosene lamps burning in that mine.
They could be anywhere around here.
Recon the area and surround the mine head.
If you see any militia, hold your fire.
We can't risk getting the hostages killed.
- <i>[Van Door Opens]</i>
- What the hell is this?
Hailey!
Hailey, the money's being wired
into your account!
- I've got a shooter by the mine.
- <i>Hailey!</i>
- I just want the hostages!
- Get down!
Hold your fire!
The hostages could be behind him!
All right, cease fire!
Martin, Jones! Get him!
- Nicholas!
- Stay down! Stay there.
- You were told to stay out of sight.
- I couldn't let him die.
Okay, go! Go!
Secure the area.
<i>[Insects Buzzing]</i>
Oh, my God.
We got bodies.
It doesn't make sense.
Three of Hailey's militia men.
Not one took less than
a half a dozen rounds.
And the... hostages?
Tracks indicate that they were
led out before the bloodbath.
Sydney, he's alive...
somewhere.
You called him Sydney.
How did you know his name?
I saw him on a news report.
He's the father of one of the hostages.
<i>His namejust... stuck in my mind.</i>
<i>Lieutenant, we've got Hailey.</i>
<i>[Hailey]</i>
<i>No, don't. Don't! Don't let 'em get me!</i>
Don't let 'em get me. Don't!
Don't let 'em get me! Don't let 'em get me, please!
You gotta protect me.
- From who?
- You gotta-
Hailey! Where is my son?
He's unconscious.
<i>All right, get him stabilized.</i>
<i>Find out everything he knows.</i>
<i>Come on.
We'll find him.
Jarod, thanks for responding
so swiftly to my message.
What message?
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Sydney did e-mail Jarod.</i>
<i>"Nicholas has been kidnapped in Appalachia.</i>
<i>Need your help. "
- I can't believe he'd send it from here.
- Meaning?
Meaning if someone put a tracer on it,
then they could easily intercept it.
- When's the last time we heard from Lyle?
- Oh, man.
- What?
- When I was at his office yesterday...
- Willie brought him an urgent memo.
- Did he say what it was?
- No.
- Huh.
Well, Lyle acted like it was nothing.
But he had that look in his eye, you know?
Like he'd just eaten a raw steak.
<i>[Lieutenant]</i>
<i>Immediate medevac extraction.</i>
<i>[Lieutenant]</i>
<i>Immediate medevac extraction.</i>
<i>Three dead, one wounded, all A.F.M.</i>
<i>My guess is that</i>
<i>some rival militia got them.</i>
But the truth is, I have no idea where the hell
the other hostages went to.
<i>We're tryin'to figure that out right now.</i>
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I know that.</i>
I remember that look on your face
when you were young-
when you couldn't find an answer.
It doesn't make any sense.
There's four sets of tracks,
which means an outside group came in...
<i>and ambushed the A.F.M.,</i>
<i>but took the hostages?</i>
- And then they killed the militia.
- Executed them.
Except for Hailey.
He was shot three times...
but in a premeditated way.
As if someone wanted him to survive...
so he could talk.
So he could talk to me.
I've got him now.
<i>Don't try to move.</i>
<i>A medevac unit will be here soon.</i>
<i>Now tell me about the men</i>
<i>who took the hostages.</i>
[Sighs, Mutters]
I never seen 'em before.
I don't want- I don't want to see 'em again.
<i>Speak to me about my son.</i>
<i>Did he get hurt?</i>
Answer me, Hailey!
Did you hurt my son?
No. No, no, l-
I didn't hurt any hostage.
- But he will.
- Who?
The-The man who took 'em.
<i>The one who made me watch</i>
<i>when he did the others and left me to die.</i>
- He's crazy.
- Who is he?
Lyle.
- Oh!
- What?
- Lyle went to the Appalachians.
- Oh!
[Keypad Beeping]
This is Parker.
Get the jet ready.
Wait, what's gonna happen
to Sydney and his son?
For a shot at bringing Jarod back?
I wouldn't put anything past Lyle.
Yes, but... what do you intend to do?
Whatever it takes.
<i>This man with the nine fingers-</i>
<i>Where did he take the hostages?</i>
He took 'em west.
- Why would Lyle do this?
- He's using Nicholas as bait...
to capture me.
<i>Jarod? Talk to me.</i>
You were right.
Hailey said a rival militia group did this.
<i>They're holed up</i>
<i>in a farmhouse in Pine Ridge.</i>
It's about...
five miles due east of here.
- Martin?
- <i>[Martin] We've got it, sir.</i>
<i>McWood, stay with the prisoner.</i>
<i>Jarod, you're with me.</i>
<i>Lieutenant, don't you think</i>
<i>I should stay with the prisoner?</i>
I'm the only one here with medical training
in case... something happens.
All right, but see what else
you can get out of Hailey...
<i>and stay in communication</i>
<i>with me through Base.</i>
- <i>We're out ofhere.</i>
- <i>Why did you lie to them</i>
<i>about where the hostages are?</i>
I couldn't put their lives at risk.
- This is my fight.
- Lyle killed your brother, I know.
<i>But now he's putting my son's life on the line,</i>
<i>which makes it my fight.</i>
Nicholas is caught in the middle.
You stay out of this.
You'll have to shoot me
to keep me out of it.
<i>[Vehicle Doors Closing,</i>
<i>Engines Starting]</i>
<i>[Vehicles Departing]</i>
Hey! Where you goin'?
What about me?
Your wounds are stabilized.
The medevac chopper will be here shortly.
You can't leave me alone!
What kind of lawman are you?
Oh, I'm not really A.T.F.
I was just... pretending.
So what happened to Hailey and his men
after you got us out of the mine?
Oh, nothing too dramatic.
We just... tied 'em up, radioed the A.T.F.
An extraction team will meet us here.
- So what are you? F.B. I?
- Something like that.
Why don't you all go up in the attic...
in case there's more trouble, hmm?
Um, Nicholas?
Would you keep me company?
<i>Why would Lyle want you</i>
<i>to track him this far out?</i>
This trail dead-ends at
an abandoned mine shanty-
no other access-
which means he wants me walking in
without a way of walking out.
- Hmm.
- It's been a long time coming, him and me.
Jarod, do you think revenge...
will put an end
to the pain in your life?
He killed my brother.
[Groans]
That's all right.
Sit down here.
<i>How did I get to this?</i>
<i>A lifetime working for a corporation</i>
<i>that takes my son away from me.</i>
And when my son is back in my life...
they kidnap him.
What does that say about me, huh?
Who am I?
[Groans]
There was a little boy that...
Nicholas was working with.
He asked me to give this to your son.
- He looks just like you.
- [Laughs]
I could see in that little boy's eyes
that Nicholas meant the world to him.
Your son is a good man.
He also gave me this to give to him.
- Was it your father's?
- It was his grandfather's.
I thought Nicholas might
like a piece of his past.
It's important to know who your family is-
who you are.
Give it back to him.
I know, Jarod.
I know how much
you've missed in your life.
Let's go.
Sheriff!
Nothin'.
Hailey must have lied toJarod.
Did he?
Or did Jarod lie to us?
[Grunts Angrily]
We're goin' back.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Three Sweepers.</i>
- Only three.
- You saw what they were capable of.
<i>The hostages must be</i>
<i>inside the structure.</i>
Jarod, I really appreciate
everything you've done.
- [Grunts]
- I can't risk you getting killed for me.
Forgive me.
<i>Shouldn't the extraction team</i>
<i>be here by now?</i>
There's no accounting for punctuality.
But as the old cliché goes,
"All good things come to those who wait."
How'd you lose your thumb?
[Laughs]
I trusted the wrong people...
<i>and I paid the price.</i>
<i>[Sydney] You haven't even made</i>
<i>a down payment on your debt.</i>
Sydney?
- Are you okay?
- Thanks to Mr. Lyle.
- <i>If it weren't for him, we'd be dead.</i>
- Oh, Nicholas, you flatter me.
Do you two know each other?
[Moans]
Aah.
Base One, it's <i>Jarod.</i> Come in.
<i>[Snapping]</i>
[Grunts]
Sleep tight.
<i>[Jet Engine Whining, Dying Down]</i>
[Man]
Miss Parker. What are you doing here?
Hello, Roy. Take us to Lyle.
- Now!
- Yes, Miss Parker.
<i>[Engine Revving]</i>
Shh. It's okay.
You're safe <i>now.</i> Come on.
Up the creek bed.
Stay low and be quiet.
Move, move.
<i>You seem angry, Sydney.</i>
- <i>You're using Nicholas as a bait to captureJarod.</i>
- Hell, yes!
Two birds, one stone. Victory from
the jaws of defeat. Lemonade from lemons.
You've endangered my son's life.
Endangered? You're not listening.
I saved him from the bad people.
<i>Sydney, Mr. Lyle is the reason I'm safe-</i>
<i>that we're all safe. He's a good man.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Except for the fact that he's a murderer.</i>
<i>If you're looking</i>
<i>for Willie and the others...</i>
they're a little tied up right now.
<i>Revenge- It's a great equalizer.</i>
Go ahead.
I won't give you another reason
to kill me, Jarod.
Oh, you think I need another reason?
Sydney, take Nicholas and go upstream.
Find the others.
They may need some help.
- I don't understand.
- Your father will explain everything to you.
Now go.
- He's right, <i>Nicholas.</i> Come.
- Who the hell is he?
Someone we need to listen to.
<i>Jarod, you're sure</i>
<i>this is how it has to be?</i>
I'm sure.
- [Phone Ringing]
- This is Martin. Yeah.
- Lieutenant, Base Camp's got
a message for you from Jarod.
- Yeah?
<i>I'm a little curious. How did you know</i>
<i>where the militia was holding them?</i>
The Centre has strange bedfellows...
even among our inbred brethren.
Needless to say, this-
this is not how I had things planned.
Oh, this is exactly how I planned it-
<i>in my mind... every day...</i>
since you killed my brother.
- I never meant to hurt Kyle.
- No.
You wanted to kill me.
Kyle just got in the way.
I told you once:
We can do great things together.
That offer's still on the table.
You think you can bribe me?
Jarod, it's not a bribe.
Mr. Lyle, do you want your last breath
on this planet to be a lie?
Now step to the center of the room.
Now turn around.
Turn... around.
- Drop to your knees.
- Please, Jarod-
On your knees!
So is this how it's gonna be?
An execution without a trial?
- You didn't give my brother a trial.
- I didn't-
- It was self-defense.
- So is this.
Jarod, I know things.
There are things I can tell you...
about your family...
<i>about who you are-</i>
<i>things no one else knows.</i>
<i>If I die,</i>
<i>all those answers die with me.</i>
<i>Just let me walk out ofhere.</i>
<i>[Helicopter Propeller Whirring]</i>
A Centre chopper.
How's that for karma?
- [Gun Clicks]
- Bad.
Ready...
aim-
No, Jarod.
Fire!
<i>[Faint Radio Chatter]</i>
<i>[Man On Radio]</i>
<i>107 Bravo, we copy. Over.</i>
Lyle?
Miss Parker.
- You've been talking toJarod?
- He's here! He went out that door!
What?
Well-
<i>Well, he's not here now.</i>
- Well, find him!
- Another day.
- What?
- Broots picked up a transmission
from an A.T.F. Unit flying in.
But he was right here!
What did he do to you?
Nothing. I had him,
and those idiots outside let him escape.
Whatever you say, Lyle.
But now it's time to go.
No, we can't just go.
Listen to me.
When the A.T.F. Walks in...
we don't have an explanation for anything
that's happened in the last two days.
If we don't go now, the trail leads back to
the Centre, and you know what that would mean.
- [Radio Chatter Continues]
- Could <i>we-</i> Could we go already?
Weird sense of justice, Jarod.
[Man]
I can't believe you found us!
[Chattering]
<i>Get in!</i>
Let's get out of here, Roy.
<i>"I would eat them in a boat.</i>
I would eat them with a"-
- Goat.
- Goat? That's silly.
[Both Laugh]
You made it.
Nicholas.
Michelle.
I've been meaning to return this.
- [Chuckles Softly]
- <i>[Boy] Nicholas, Nicholas.</i>
- Let's read.
- Not so fast.
There's someone I'd like you to meet, Seth.
- This is-
- I'm Sydney, Nicholas's friend.
No, Seth. He's not my friend.
He's my father.
Okay, here we go. "And I will-
- <i>"And I will-</i>
- <i>"eat them in the rain.</i>
- <i>"eat them in the rain.</i>
- <i>"And in the dark.</i>
- "And in the dark.
- "And on a train.
- "And on a train.
- <i>"And in a car.</i>
- <i>"And in a car.</i>
- "And in a tree.
- "And in a tree.
- "They are so good...
so good, you see."
<i>They are so good"- I see.</i>
<i>That's very good, Seth.</i>
<i>Sorry I couldn't stick around</i>
<i>to say good-bye.</i>
[Sydney] Jarod, I don't know how
to thank you for everything you did...
and- [Chuckles]
I'm sorry I hit you.
It's okay.
Maybe it knocked a little sense into me.
- Where's Nicholas now?
- Back with his students.
- He's invited his mother and me
to come down to visit again.
- That's nice.
I mean, that will be really nice...
for your family.
We're hardly a family.
Boy barely knows me.
He knows-
He knows you love him.
You love...
him.
[Lead Breaks]
- <i>[Phone Rings]</i>
- What?
- <i>[Jarod] How well do you know your father?</i>
- Better than you know yours.
- Yes. Well, I'm working on that one.
- Why the call, Jarod?
<i>[Jarod] You and your father are close.</i>
<i>But how close?</i>
Does he share important things
with you?
Would he tell you about
the big developments in his life?
I'd be insanely optimistic to think this little
quiz show had a bonus round, wouldn't I?
- Check your mail, Miss Parker.
- Why?
Because we all
have a lot to learn.
Including me.
Gotta go.
Don't wanna be late
for my first day of school.
- Jarod-
- [Dial Tone]
<i>What did he have to say?</i>
A lot less than he knows,
that's for sure.
<i>[Paper Rustling]</i>
Miss Parker?
It's a copy of a letter to my father
from his attorney.
He's changing his will.
- Hmm.
- <i>Miss Parker.</i>
Statistician from the
Brooksberry field office.
Swears she saw Jarod
on her lunch break.
<i>Call Brooksberry.
Get a local Sweeper team moving... now.
Okay.
[Scraping]
<i>[Jarod] Well, well, well,</i>
<i>the Vanguard Program.</i>
The finest minds at the university.
I'll have to do my best to keep up.
Welcome... to graduate class 523-
Psychology of the Criminal Mind.
I'm your new professor,
Dr. Gardner.
But please, call meJarod.
Oh, my God!
<i>[Woman Screams]</i>
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
[Murmuring]
- Somebody get some help!
- Call 911!
- You can cancel that call.
- <i>[Woman] What?</i>
I may be a little sticky,
but otherwise I'm just fine.
Oh, the gunmen.
They were some drama students
that I recruited.
And the shots? Blanks.
I assume there's a point to scaring
the hell out of us like that.
<i>Oh, yes, sir.</i>
<i>There's absolutely a point.</i>
I'm the cop. You're the witness.
Describe the gunman to me.
- Tall, dark suit.
- How tall? How dark?
- Uh-
- "Uh" doesn't cut it. I need details.
- What color hair did he have?
- Brown. Maybe a little reddish.
- No, it was blond.
- Straight or wavy?
- Straight.
- Wavy.
Any distinguishing features?
Scars? Facial hair?
- What kind of shoes was he wearing?
- Shoes?
All I saw was the gun.
I couldn't even tell you if the guy had feet.
- <i>[Laughter]</i>
- <i>This is a highly charged situation.</i>
Your adrenaline is pumping.
Here's my point.
That even the most brilliant minds...
- can miss a thing or two.
- <i>[Woman] Speak for yourself.</i>
Your killer, Jarod,
was a white male, 6'1 ", 170.
<i>He had straight</i>
<i>brown hair. Blond...</i>
<i>if you count the cheesy</i>
<i>shampooed-in highlights.</i>
<i>And except for the played-out 90210 sideburns,</i>
<i>he was clean shaven.</i>
<i>Clothing-wise, and that's where
the real crime was committed...
he wore an off-the-rack
<i>J.C.</i> Penny special, charcoal gray...
with lapels that screamed
Bush administration.
<i>Oh, and start your manhunt</i>
<i>in the Financial Aid office...</i>
<i>because nobody with even</i>
<i>10 bucks in their pockets...</i>
would be seen
wearing those shoes.
- [All Chuckle]
- <i>[Jarod] Very good, Miss-</i>
- <i>Dunning, Claire.</i>
- <i>Ah, yes.</i>
Top of the Vanguard class.
Grady and Matthew here were close,
but, uh, no cigar though.
Even with their vast intellect,
it would be pretty difficult...
to keep up with someone
who joined Mensa at age 13.
I'm kinda curious as to
your qualifications, Doc.
Well, you frame a couple of diplomas,
you slap your name on a few dissertations...
and voilŕ,
people think you're a genius.
<i>So, what kind of genius surprises</i>
<i>are we in for next?</i>
Something that will help us
delve into the criminal mind.
This class has been put on hold
since your last professor...
Alden Clark, disappeared.
<i>Now, I thought,</i>
<i>wouldn't it be provocative...</i>
<i>if we all solved the mystery</i>
<i>ofhis disappearance?</i>
He cleaned out his bank account
and ran off with his mistress.
<i>Maybe. Maybe not.</i>
This is Professor Clark's book...
<i>The Perfect Murder.</i>
<i>Now, what if Professor Clark</i>
<i>didn't run off with his mistress?</i>
<i>What if, for argument's sake,</i>
<i>that he himself...</i>
was the victim of...
the perfect murder.
- <i>[Miss Parker] If murder were legal, Broots?</i>
- <i>[Broots] Huh?</i>
Your tip on Jarod?
False alarm.
Sweeper team came up empty.
Oh, well, that-
Oh, I see, so kill the messenger?
Well, that's your first
usable idea in weeks.
<i>Broots, do you know who that man</i>
<i>speaking with my father is?</i>
Yeah, he's a doctor.
I just rode up with him on the elevator.
- Doctor?
- Yeah.
- Changing his will.
- Huh?
Something the matter, Miss Parker?
There you go.
<i>[Baby Gurgles]</i>
<i>Mrs.</i> Clark.
If you're another bill collector,
you can save your breath.
Not even the house
is mine anymore.
Actually, my name
is Jarod Gardner.
I'm taking over your husband's classes
at the university.
<i>[Baby Cooing]</i>
I'm sorry. I've been meaning to stop by
and clear his things out of the office.
I just haven't been able
to bring myself to do it yet.
I understand.
[Chuckles]
Hi.
They're so fragile
and so innocent.
<i>Yet, with one look,</i>
<i>they can help you through anything.</i>
Why are you here, Dr. Gardner?
To help.
<i>Alden and I used to dream about</i>
<i>the day our children would...</i>
run around this yard.
It must be very difficult to be
the only one who still believes in him.
It's been a year now.
I don't have any illusions that my husband
is suddenly gonna walk back into my life...
but I need answers.
I need something to tell our child,
other than his father ran off with his girlfriend.
Alden and I had
a very difficult time getting pregnant.
There was so much heartbreak.
He wanted this baby so badly.
There is no way he would have
missed his son's birth if he were still alive.
[Baby Gurgles]
<i>The harsh reality is he left her.</i>
<i>Alden Clark was having an affair.</i>
I found e-mail on his computer from his
mistress, fantasies, plans for running away.
None of it G-rated.
Plus, he withdrew every last cent from
their account the day he left.
He had a baby on the way.
It doesn't make any sense.
Look, I feel for <i>Mrs.</i> Clark
and her child...
but sooner or later
she needs to face the facts.
No body, no sign of foul play.
The man walked out.
Now, Dr. Gardner, it's only natural to want
the facts about the man you're replacing...
but I have 25 real cases
to handle.
That's my harsh reality.
Excuse me.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>So, you want to commit the perfect murder.</i>
How do you go about it?
Well?
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>Use those brilliant minds of yours.</i>
Become a killer.
A sociopath.
<i>Someone without compassion,</i>
<i>without a conscience.</i>
This is sick. We're talking about Professor
<i>Clark here. We should just leave it alone.
<i>No, I think we can stand</i>
<i>to learn a great deal from this.</i>
So I'm asking that you
play along with me.
I'm willing to go along with any game
you wanna play, Jarod.
<i>[Students Chuckles]</i>
At the risk of sounding
like Claire, I'm in.
- I'm in.
- Me too.
- Good.
Then let's begin.
Name all the ways
that you can kill someone.
- Stabbing.
- Stabbing.
- Shooting.
- Shooting. Very good.
- Suffocation.
- Suffocation.
[No Audible Dialogue]
There certainly are
a lot of ways to kill somebody.
But you still have to
deal with the body.
- I'd bury it out in the woods somewhere.
- <i>[Claire] It's too risky.</i>
You hear stories all the time
about some hiker stumbling over a stiff.
<i>It'd be smarter to make</i>
<i>the perfect murder look like a suicide.</i>
You still end up with an investigation.
If it's not flawless, you're screwed.
So how would you deal
with it, Claire?
<i>The perfect murder isn't a murder.</i>
<i>It's an accident.</i>
- Hmm.
- <i>She's right. Plausible deniability.</i>
Make it look like an accident. Something
that fits into the victim's daily routine.
<i>If we're talking about Dr. Clark,</i>
<i>how about on the road up to his cabin?</i>
- His cabin?
- <i>Yeah, he had a cabin. He used to go up there...</i>
in the mountains
after school on Fridays.
And he did disappear on a Friday.
[Young Sydney]
LatelyJarod's been bored.
We must find better ways
to engage his intellect.
Keep a brilliant mind
from becoming idle.
[Young Jarod]
Sydney, I can't do these anymore.
These same problems,
they're so monotonous.
- What are they doing?
- They're just working on a new security system.
<i>Come on, Jarod.
Back to work.
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>
- Hello.
- Jarod, I just got your message.
Alden wasn't headed to the cabin
the day he vanished.
The students told me that he headed up
to his cabin every Friday night to write.
Well, he planned to go, but that was
the Friday I found out I was pregnant.
I called him at school, and he said
he was coming right home to celebrate.
That's the last time
I spoke to him.
So, the police never searched
the road up to your cabin.
<i>[Mrs. Clark]</i>
<i>No. No, they didn't.</i>
[Chattering]
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>We can use another flare over here, please.</i>
- <i>[Man] Mark it off.</i>
- <i>[Man #2] We'll be right there.</i>
- You get around, Professor Gardner.
- I just heard what happened.
Got a call from
an anonymous motorist.
Guy stopped. Let his dog take a leak.
Glanced down, spied the wreck.
- Hmm.
- Kinda feel for <i>Mrs.</i> Clark.
It just goes from
bad to worse for her.
She told me he wasn't headed up here
the day he disappeared.
That doesn't surprise me.
Especially finding these in the car.
Plane tickets.
Mazatlán. One for Clark,
the other issued to a Karen Sweet.
- We found these in the glove box.
- The other woman?
Mm-hmm. We also found the 40,000 in cash
<i>Clark took from his account.
And a six-pack
of empty beer bottles.
So you think he was headed
up to his cabin to meet her...
had a few beers and lost control?
Yeah, the story's clear.
<i>Clark died, the victim
of a car accident.
<i>[Mrs. Clark]</i>
<i>I guess part of me was still hoping.</i>
That's only natural.
You know, yesterday, I would have done
anything to keep this house...
and memories.
Now I've got the money to stay.
I'm not sure I want to anymore.
Don't give up on your husband yet.
I'm doing the best I can.
I really am.
But now the plane tickets
and the photographs.
[Scoffs]
What am I supposed to believe?
Believe what's in your heart.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Are you sure you're all right, Daddy?</i>
I never felt better.
It's amazing how we adapt...
to changes life throws at us.
- Even the big ones.
- Big ones?
Yeah, I always thought I'd be frightened
standing on the threshold, as it were...
but honestly, I made peace
with a lot of things.
Daddy, are- are you dying?
I know about the doctor,
your will and the life insurance.
- Oh, angel-
- Please don't lie to me. Not about this.
Sweetie, read the labels. Hmm?
Vitamin "E," Ginseng...
Viagra?
[Chuckles]
I'm in love, sweetheart.
L-I feel like I've been reborn.
- What?
- Mm.
Who is she?
Oh, no, I promised her
she'd be here when I told you.
I don't wanna start messing up
this early in our engagement.
Engagement?
Daddy, this is crazy.
Oh, I know, I know.
After all this time, your old man
found somebody who makes him happy.
<i>Hmm?</i>
- <i>Pretty wild, isn't it?</i>
- What's that, Claire?
- <i>Pretty wild, isn't it?</i>
- What's that, Claire?
Professor Clark
turning up like that.
Yeah, talk about him one day,
he's found the next. Makes you wonder.
Wonder is a wonderful thing, Grady.
How do you feel
about it, Matthew?
Sad, I guess. I mean, <i>Dr.</i> Clark
was our adviser.
Well, I'm just surprised
that you're all not more upset.
Why be upset?
This will make the game so much more fun.
- The game?
- <i>In class. Now there are clues to follow.</i>
It's no longer just theoretical.
Now it's real.
Much more... dangerous.
<i>You know, Jarod...</i>
if you ever wanna
get together...
pick each other's brains.
A little one-on-one?
- [Squeaking]
- <i>Careful, Claire.</i>
Don't cross a line
you can't come back from.
Oh, well.
I guess my friends
will have to do.
See you in class.
[Claire Laughs]
Hey.
[Klaxon Blaring]
Jarod.
<i>[Laughing]</i>
[Keys Clacking]
Hmm. Professor Clark disappears,
and your grades take a nosedive.
<i>Something on your mind, Matthew?</i>
<i>What about you, Claire?</i>
Feeling guilty about anything?
Hmm.
<i>I guess not.</i>
<i>This is getting too creepy,</i>
<i>don't you think Professor Gardner?</i>
If this really is
the perfect murder-
What if I told you
it wasn't the perfect murder?
<i>What if I told you that our killer</i>
<i>made a very serious mistake.</i>
You're not just toying
with us now, are you, Jarod?
Professor Clark's body...
it was recovered
on the road to his cabin...
but he wasn't going to his cabin
that Friday night.
He was going home.
He changed his routine.
But the killer didn't know that.
- So what next?
- <i>We go back to the scene of the crime.</i>
You wanna fake a car crash.
How do you do it?
<i>Do you run the professor's car off the road?</i>
<i>Do you cut his brake line?</i>
Or maybe you just drug him.
Well, ramming the car
would leave paint evidence...
and cutting the brakes
would be way too obvious.
And drugs would be found
in an autopsy.
Not necessarily.
Right, uh, Matthew?
Well, l-I don't know.
Oh, come on. You're the ace
of your biochemistry class, aren't you?
Why don't you tell everyone
what dimethylphenol is?
- Um, it's a heavy sedative.
- And it metabolizes in the body how?
The same as alcohol.
It has the same chemical signature.
So, a shot of DMP,
it would knock the victim out.
But if anybody checked,
it would show up in the blood no different...
<i>than, let's say, a few beers.</i>
Okay, so maybe we've got the how.
What about the why?
The motivation.
Why would somebody wanna kill somebody?
Tomorrow in class,
we'll do a little role-playing exercise...
that will help us
discover this motivation.
Uh, Richard,
you can play the cop.
<i>And, Gwen, you can be</i>
<i>the other woman.</i>
And, um...
you, Claire, you're the killer.
<i>But you had accomplices.</i>
<i>How about, uh, you, Grady?</i>
<i>And you, Matthew.</i>
<i>Strictly theoretical, of course.</i>
This is, after all, just a game.
Let the games begin.
<i>[Rat Squeaking]</i>
<i>[Young Sydney]</i>
<i>Did you think you'd get away with it?</i>
I just get so bored
sometimes, Sydney.
A sharp mind left idle can become
a very sharp weapon indeed.
You gonna come in, Doc?
Or do you just like to watch?
Interesting experiment.
There's no way the rat can win.
<i>Every turn leads nowhere.</i>
<i>No reward, no way out.</i>
- Seems pointless.
- Maybe that is the point.
He with the biggest brain wins.
Is that it?
Or she.
<i>Certainly not them.
<i>Their tiny brains</i>
<i>can barely think.</i>
<i>So, round and round they go,</i>
<i>chasing their tails forever.</i>
Very cruel, Miss Dunning.
Although I can't believe
a rigged game doesn't bore you.
Once in a while...
even the dumber animals
do something unpredictable.
<i>Something that catches you</i>
<i>off guard.</i>
<i>And that's when it really gets fun.</i>
Fun, till you get bitten.
I haven't been bitten yet.
Yet, being the operative word.
Everyone's gotta go sometime.
The question is-
Who will go first?
Which brings us back to-
the biggest brain rules.
The superior mind
always has a way out.
Tiny little door marked "Exit."
Well, maybe it's time
to run for it.
- <i>[Rat Squeaking]</i>
- Oh, uh, Jarod.
<i>[Camera Whirs]</i>
I'll keep it in my glove box.
<i>Just like Professor Clark.</i>
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>I just don't get it, Sydney.</i>
He hasn't so much
as looked at another woman...
since the day my mother died.
And now, just like that,
he decides he's replacing her.
No, he's not replacing her.
Your father has lived alone
a long time.
It's only natural for him
to reach out again.
You sound like you're on his side.
<i>There are no sides here.</i>
<i>You must let him move on with his life.</i>
I'm sorry it's painful for you.
It often is
for the children involved.
- I'm not a child.
- Then you know what you must do.
Professor Clark said
in his book...
that motive springs from that bottomless pit
called the human psyche.
<i>That no matter how deeply you dig,</i>
<i>you never exhaust it.</i>
Let's do right by him, shall we?
Let's figure out why...
he was killed.
Let's start with the police.
Richard, you're our cop.
<i>What do they think?</i>
Statistically, money and jealousy top the list.
It could have been a robbery.
Except the 40,000
was left in the car.
So jealousy then. Another teacher
with a gripe against Professor Clark.
<i>[Gwen]</i>
<i>Or his wife, if she knew about the affair.</i>
It could be something
as simple as road rage.
No, that's spontaneous.
This was planned.
Well, we're in
a unique position here today...
because we have the killers
in our class.
Why don't we ask them?
- Matthew.
- Yeah.
<i>Why would you murder someone?</i>
- Maybe I didn't like him.
- <i>If you don't like someone, you avoid them.</i>
If you see them walking down the street,
you walk to the other side.
You don't send them
careening off a cliff.
Grady, any thoughts?
I don't know.
Why does anyone murder?
I'm not asking anyone.
I'm asking you.
So, dig down deep into that bottomless pit
of yours and tell us why would you kill.
- Well, uh-
- Hello?
There are a million reasons
to kill. Revenge.
<i>Revolt. Release.</i>
<i>Superstition.</i>
<i>Paranoia. Bad debt.</i>
<i>Bad childhood. Bad hair day.</i>
<i>[Jarod] I'm afraid you've missed</i>
<i>the most relevant one.</i>
Arrogance.
You see, our killers, they think
they're smarter than the rest of us...
and that this is all a game.
That's the reason
they have accomplices.
What fun is it to commit
the perfect murder...
if you don't have someone
to gloat over it with?
<i>But arrogancejust may be</i>
<i>their downfall.</i>
Professor Clark says in his book
that the perfect murder...
is committed by one person alone.
- Why is that?
- Because accomplices can be unpredictable.
Exactly.
You never know what they might do...
how they might react.
Take our role players over here.
What if one of them couldn't take
the pressure and crumbled?
What if one of them went to the police
and cut a deal?
Aren't you getting a little ahead
of yourself, Jarod?
<i>I mean, there's no evidence that Professor</i>
<i>Clark's death was anything but an accident.</i>
Well, quite obviously, you haven't spoken
to the police today.
I talked to the detective
in charge of this case...
and he's convinced that the Polaroids
in the glove compartment were fakes...
along with the e-mail
and any other evidence...
<i>that might suggest</i>
<i>that there was another woman.</i>
As of today...
Professor Clark's death
was reclassified...
as a homicide.
<i>[Murmuring]</i>
<i>As a matter of fact,</i>
<i>Detective Rusk thinks...</i>
the killer may even be
right here in the classroom.
[Murmuring]
<i>Well, that's all for today.</i>
See you the next time.
- Not if I see you first.
- Come on, Claire. Let's go. Please.
Please?
[No Audible Dialogue]
[No Audible Dialogue Continues]
<i>[Phones Ringing]</i>
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>
You need a special pass
to get back here.
- I just have a delivery.
- For who?
- Detective Rusk.
- I'll take it.
- Are you sure?
- Trust me. It's in the right hands.
<i>Cool. Thanks.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>"Take Polaroids ofhooker to plant in glove box.</i>
"Hack into Clark's bank account.
Get dimethylphenol
from the chem lab."
It goes on and on.
And it's all in your handwriting.
You might wanna
refresh yourself, Matthew.
<i>It's been a long time</i>
<i>since you murdered Professor Clark.</i>
- Where'd you get this?
- In an envelope...
addressed to the Hanover
Sheriff's Department.
Oh, there was
a little note inside...
<i>from a concerned citizen.</i>
<i>Claire wouldn't-
She wouldn't do this to me.
And Grady.
They're my friends.
And you're their patsy.
You see this baby, Matthew?
He'll never know
who his father is.
<i>Not for a second.</i>
<i>Not ever.</i>
And his mother,
she agonized for months...
wondering when
he was coming home...
<i>until they discovered</i>
<i>that he was dead.</i>
We were just sitting around
talking one night.
Getting drunk.
You know?
We were just tossing out ideas
on how to pull it off.
It was just a game.
<i>When I walked into class that day,</i>
<i>and Professor Clark wasn't there...</i>
<i>Claire just started to laugh.
She said, "What good
is building the perfect toy...
if you're not gonna
play with it?"
- She and Grady actually killed him.
- <i>And you?</i>
You sat around
and you did nothing.
I was afraid!
What was I supposed to do?
<i>Claire's my best friend.
And I didn't want her
to be mad at me.
The game is over, Matthew.
It's time to do the right thing.
- Where's Matthew?
- By now, probably some prisoner's wife.
But once he starts talking,
they're gonna come straight for us.
So let them. As long as you keep
your mouth shut and your pants dry...
no one can touch us.
Good morning, Claire.
Grady.
<i>Professor Gardner!</i>
<i>Professor!</i>
- Richard, is something wrong?
- Matthew Collins is dead.
He killed himself.
[Fizzing]
- They bought my suicide?
- Hook, line and sinker.
I don't quite understand
what you're going to do.
I'm going to murder them...
perfectly.
<i>[Rolling Thunder]</i>
I'm telling you. It couldn't have worked out
better if we planned it this way.
[Laughs]
Oh, wait, we did plan it this way.
Matthew is dead.
He wasn't up to our level, Grady.
What he did is only proof of that.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
- What the hell are you doing here?
I hope I'm not too late
for the party.
- We're mourning our friend, Professor.
- I know.
That's why I brought
his favorite beer.
So we could pay our respects.
- <i>Matthew would want it this way.</i>
- [Opens Bottle]
Go ahead.
- To the biggest brain.
- To, uh, rats in a maze.
- [Bottles Clink Together]
- Like Matthew, your backup plan.
- Your little door marked "Exit."
- May he rest in peace.
- [Laughs]
- What's so funny?
You really think
this is over, don't you?
<i>Well, it is, isn't it?</i>
Sure, the exit door is open,
but where does it lead?
[Quiet Chuckle]
I've a little backup plan too.
- <i>Nighty-night.</i>
- [Groans]
<i>Claire, no sleeping in class.</i>
<i>Claire, wake up.
<i>There you are. You were out for so long,</i>
<i>I was getting worried about you.</i>
- What the hell-
- I'll take this.
Wouldn't want you smudging
your <i>fingerprints.</i> Careful.
That chair's a little wobbly.
One false move and- [Gags]
It's not exactly what I had in mind
when I said...
we should be alone together.
We're not alone... are we, Grady?
Wh-What is this?
Is this supposed to be a joke?
Oh, come on, Claire.
I know you're full of yourself...
<i>but did you really think that you were</i>
<i>the only person in the world...</i>
that could pull off
the perfect murder?
<i>This isn't funny.</i>
<i>Let us go, Jarod.</i>
You know, a teacher is very lucky
if he can learn as much from his students...
as they learn from him.
In your case,
I hit the jackpot.
Especially with all the mistakes you made.
Matthew being one of them.
- <i>Oh, by the way, he's still alive.</i>
- <i>[Cocks Gun]</i>
Faking his suicide was all part of my plan.
[Imitates Gunshot]
What? You want us to talk?
Is that it? Fine, I'll talk.
<i>Grady, shut up.</i>
<i>Ajury could never convict us.</i>
<i>If</i> you were going to court.
But you're not.
<i>I'm the onlyjudge that matters now,</i>
<i>so let's examine the evidence.</i>
First, in all your planning,
you forgot one very important thing.
Professor Clark had a family.
He had a baby on the way...
and a wife who never
stopped believing in him.
You two, on the other hand,
you only have each other.
Before the tragedy, that is.
- <i>What tragedy?</i>
- <i>Don't play dumb, Claire.</i>
It's all in your suicide note.
<i>It says in here how you and Grady</i>
<i>killed Professor Clark.</i>
But grieving for the loss of his friend Matthew,
Grady cracked under pressure...
and wanted to go to the police
and confess.
So you- [Imitates Gunshot]
Killed him.
<i>And then you hung yourself, because you</i>
<i>couldn't face the utter futility and remorse.</i>
Brilliant minds.
They're so fragile.
- They'll know it's not my handwriting.
- <i>But it is.</i>
You see, I found these notes
that you wrote Professor Clark in his files...
and I traced over
various words and voilŕ.
Suicide note.
Gun with your fingerprints.
It's... perfect.
- Go to hell.
- You first.
- <i>Actually, Grady first.</i>
- [Cocks Gun]
- Murder before suicide.
- <i>Wait! Wait!</i>
- I'll tell you whatever you wanna hear!
- Shut up, Grady.
He won't do it.
The bullet's just a blank.
Oh, you think so?
<i>[Grady] Please, Jarod. Oh, God, no!</i>
<i>Come on, Claire, it's over!</i>
[Whimpering]
Okay, we did it!
We murdered Professor Clark!
Partly it was thrill, but mostly Claire was mad
at him because he wouldn't sleep with her!
- Shut up, Grady.
- Just don't kill me.
As far as I'm concerned,
you're dead already.
No!
Well, well, well, well, well.
What do you know?
It was a bluff.
But one that wasn't
missed by the camera.
<i>All your talk</i>
<i>about the perfect murder.</i>
All your claims as to
how extraordinary you are.
You killed Professor Clark
because he spurned you.
<i>You're no genius.</i>
<i>You're as common as they come.</i>
[Grunts]
<i>[Claire]</i>
<i>Jarod.</i>
<i>Jarod!</i>
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Daddy, I've come with a little peace offering.</i>
<i>[Woman Laughing]</i>
Hello?
- <i>[Laughing Continues]</i>
- Who's in my father's private washroom?
<i>[Water Running]</i>
Daddy.
Oh, my God.
Hi, Miss Parker.
[Giggles]
- Not Bridget.
- <i>Look.</i>
I'm gonna be your new mommy.
You're gonna marry the bi-
The woman who tried to kill you?
Oh, come on, angel.
Be happy for me.
- Honey bunny.
- Hmm?
- I'm your new angel now.
- Oh.
<i>[Both Chuckling]</i>
Hmm.
<i>[Jarod] So, how well do you think</i>
<i>you know your father now, Miss Parker?</i>
- Coming to the wedding?
- I'm not big on brides in black leather.
Although, there is a certain
enjoyable irony in it.
Funny, I'm not seeing it.
Oh, give her a chance.
A chance to what?
Suck the rest of the life out of my father?
Love can change people,
Miss Parker.
- [Phone Beeps]
- [Chuckles]
[Dial Tone, Beeps]
We miss you, Alden.
<i>Chinese elm.
Alden's favorite.
- It's beautiful.
- Mm.
I know someone who's ready
to climb it already.
<i>Come here.
Hello. Yes.
Oh, Jarod, you've given us so much.
The chance to bury Alden.
Our home.
- I just wish I could have given it all back to you.
- You've given us the truth.
Nothing mattered more
to Alden than that.
Thank you.
I just want to know
how you knew all along.
I mean, even when
I had doubts.
The truth was always
in your husband's book.
In the dedication.
"To Chris: Whom I've been waiting
to meet for so very long."
Good luck. Bye, Chris.
[Gurgling]
<i>[Miss Parker] Apparently</i>
<i>Jarod's been working at this university...</i>
<i>doing some type of genetic engineering</i>
<i>with plants.</i>
- You think he's in here?
- <i>[Miss Parker] Lights are on.</i>
<i>Somebody's home.</i>
- Willie, go get him.
- My pleasure.
Jarod! Freeze!
- [Grunts]
- Time to come home, genius.
L- I'm-I'm not him!
[Grunts]
- You're not who?
- Whoever you're looking for.
Well, then, who the hell are you?
L-l-I'm the guy
who waters the plants.
- Name's Francis.
- <i>Well, Francis, do you know this man?</i>
Jarod. Yeah, he's the, uh...
scientist who used to work here.
- "Used to."
- Yeah. Like I told the other guy
that was looking for him...
- he's gone.
- Someone else is looking forJarod?
Yeah. The blind guy-
kind of Chinese-looking.
Said his name was Mr., uh-
[Snaps Fingers]
Lee.
<i>[Man, Asian Accent]</i>
<i>I have absorbed all the files on Jarod.</i>
<i>Yes, everything you gave me</i>
<i>from his childhood to the present.</i>
No. He's quite
an interesting man.
There are seven people
I need to speak with.
You get me those seven people,
and I will deliverJarod.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already</i>
<i>demonstrating more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
<i>[Woman] For those who can see,</i>
<i>we must really be a sight.</i>
- Why is that?
- You know, the blind leading the blind.
- [Both Laugh]
- Please, no more blind jokes, Miss Newton.
- No, you can call me Rachel.
- Ah, Rachel.
- <i>And I am Mr. Lee.</i>
- Uh, who-who's typing?
Ah. Her name is-
[Speaking Chinese]
- Anna, for short- my new associate.
- How exactly can I help you?
I believe you once knew
a man named Jarod.
Ah.
Jarod helped me after I lost
my sight in a terrorist bombing.
He's helped lots of people
who have been victimized.
<i>He taught me to see again...</i>
<i>so to speak.</i>
Why do you want
to know aboutJarod?
I have reason to believe
that he is in trouble.
- I need you to help him.
- How can <i>I help?
I'm sure you realize...
that the loss of vision...
often nurtures deeper insight.
And you feel
I've developed this insight?
But of course.
That is why I brought you here.
<i>Please, tell me howJarod...</i>
helped you and affected your life.
I metJarod
while I was still in therapy...
not long after the bombing.
I was... drawn to him
right from the start.
It was like he felt my pain,
my fears.
<i>[Rachel's Voice]</i>
<i>Six... seven...</i>
<i>eight... nine... ten-</i>
- You can stop counting. You're here.
- Oh.
- [Chuckling]
- You must have stepped into the room.
- It's 11 steps to the door.
- I did. That's very good.
- It's a beautiful day. Why don't we go outside?
- Oh, no.
L-l- I think
I'd rather stay here.
Rachel.
You have
to go outside sometime.
I was supposed to work
in my studio...
but it was such a nice day,
I decided to go on the rooftop of city hall.
That's what happened
the last time I went outside.
You were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.
That is not your fault.
You can't stop living
your life because of it.
You know, when I had my eyes
behind the camera...
I could see things
no one else could see.
<i>I can remember details</i>
<i>of nearly every picture I ever took.</i>
<i>That's ironic.</i>
<i>They tell me he was there that day.</i>
I must have seen the man who did this
to me as he was setting his bomb.
<i>But as hard as I try,</i>
<i>I can't remember.</i>
So, are you saying that...
Jarod connected with you
emotionally?
Oh, it was more than that.
It was almost like he became me.
<i>He seemed to know me,</i>
<i>understand me...</i>
more than I knew myself.
The way he enabled me
to face my life again was magical...
like an artist
painting a picture, only...
Jarod was the painter,
and I was the canvas.
- <i>[Rachel] Is this some kind of new therapy?</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Call it a simulation.</i>
I'm going to create
an environment...
with all the stimuli
you need to recreate an event.
- And for you to become someone.
- Who do you want me to become?
- Yourself.
- [Gasps]
Oh, my camera.
Oh, I haven't touched
this since the-
well, since the day at city hall.
<i>Now, I want you</i>
<i>to develop that roll of film-</i>
- [Camera Clicks]
- <i>the pictures you took that day.</i>
- Oh, but there's no film in it.
- <i>I know.</i>
I want you to develop
the pictures in your mind.
I'm on the rooftop
at city hall.
<i>The natural light</i>
<i>is at its perfect angle.</i>
<i>The building is-</i>
<i>is closed. It's Sunday...</i>
<i>and I'm getting last minute shots</i>
<i>for my gallery opening.</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Are you alone?</i>
- I think- I don't see anyone.
I don't-
I don't see anyone...
but l- I feel a-
<i>tingle on the back of my neck.</i>
- <i>Go on.</i>
- <i>I don't see anyone, but I hear something.</i>
- <i>What do you hear?</i>
- <i>Footsteps walking... quickly away.</i>
<i>It's right before it happens.</i>
<i>Rachel, do you see the bomb?</i>
It's only an instant
before the flash.
- <i>Do you see him?</i>
- No.
<i>But I smell something.</i>
- <i>I smell-</i>
- You smell him.
It must be-
It's cologne.
Thank you.
Because of what he found
in my mind...
Jarod was able
to catch the bomber...
and help me find the courage
to believe in myself again.
That's very interesting.
Anna?
Thank you for everything.
My assistant, Anna,
will take you home now.
You know, you were right
about insight, Mr. Lee.
You don't want to helpJarod.
You want to catch him.
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i>But you won't succeed.</i>
He's too smart,
even for you.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Who the hell is Mr. Lee?</i>
What does a blind Chinese man
want with Jarod anyway?
The same thing anyone else would-
an advantage.
Jarod's a very valuable commodity.
Question is...
- who wants to trade in him?
- None of this makes any sense.
<i>Broots, go back toJarod's last lair.</i>
<i>Check the neighborhood...</i>
the airport, the train station-
- anywhere that someone
might have seen this Mr. Lee.
- Okay.
<i>I'm also interested in finding out</i>
<i>about our sightless friend.</i>
Keep Bridget up to speed on any new
developments. She's my liaison in this thing.
[Giggles]
Since when do I need
a liaison to my own father?
Since you're not
the only ones afterJarod.
But don't worry, angel. It shouldn't be
that hard to catch a blind man.
- All you have to do is open <i>your</i> eyes.
- Mmm.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>What's goin'on?</i>
- <i>[Buzzer Sounds]</i>
- Some people want to talk to you.
<i>[Indistinct Shouts]</i>
- <i>[Cell Door Slams]</i>
- <i>[Man Scoffs] So what's this...</i>
<i>free egg roll night</i>
<i>on the "Ginsu"?</i>
"Ginsu"-
That's Japanese.
<i>A man of such erudition...</i>
<i>a scholar, a physician.</i>
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i>This imprisonment must have reacquainted</i>
<i>you with the low, common man.</i>
[Snickers]
Perhaps that's his idea.
Hmm. Dr. Fein,
you may address me as...
Mr. Lee.
Well, Mr. Lee.
I don't know
what this is about, but-
This is about an acquaintance
of yours whom I'm searching for.
His name is Jarod.
You gotta be kidding.
For 18 months, I've been trying
to tell people aboutJarod.
But there's no trace of him.
It's like he never existed.
- You seem frustrated.
- Frustrated?
That psycho's the reason I'm spending
the rest of my life in an eight-by-eight cell.
- Sue me if I'm frustrated.
- [Laughs]
Dr. Fein, you <i>did</i> bury
an innocent man alive.
- You got a point?
- Yes.
Jarod, in his unique way, merely
exposed you to the rest of the world.
What is one man's justice
is another man's revenge.
Yeah, well, a lot of good
that's gonna do me now.
<i>[Rattling]</i>
Dr. Fein,
would you like to seeJarod...
in an environment
worse than this?
- Can you do that?
- If you tell me what he did to you.
What he did?
He tried to kill me.
He tried to bury <i>me</i> alive.
[Grunting]
Ugh!
- [Gasps]
- Trick or treat.
- You scared the hell out of me.
- Well, that is, after all...
what this holiday
is all about, isn't it?
Oh, you're too late.
He's gone.
- Who's gone?
- Enrique, the young man you killed.
- What kind of sick prank are you tryin' to play?
- Oh, this isn't a prank.
It's a life lesson.
You know,
in some cultures they believe...
that the spirit of a man
killed in anger returns...
to exact revenge
upon his perpetrator.
- Spooky, huh?
- I'm gettin' out of here.
Oh, no, you can't leave,
Dr. Fein.
This is the Day ofThe Dead.
And you, sir, are the special guest.
<i>Let me out ofhere!</i>
<i>Jarod! This isn't funny!</i>
I know. It would be awful
to be buried alive...
especially with that
on your shoe.
<i>Jarod! Jarod!</i>
<i>Shh, shh, shh, shh.</i>
There's no reason
to wake the dead.
- You're gonna be joining them soon enough.
- Jarod, please!
Did Enrique discover
that you had killed...
one of the research subjects
he recruited for you?
- You're crazy!
- Uh-uh-uh. That is not a very nice thing to say...
to a man with a shovel...
- is it?
- Jarod, please!
You took an innocent
homeless man...
and you turned him
into your guinea pig-
someone to test
your heart drug on...
someone that you didn't think
would be missed if it didn't work.
<i>Well, it didn't work, did it?</i>
<i>And someone did miss him- Enrique.</i>
So you buried him alive
to save your research, didn't you?
Didn't you?
Didn't you? Didn't you?
Yes! Yes!
Now let me out of here!
Screaming isn't going to help
you conserve your oxygen.
And believe me,
you're going to need all you can get.
- No. No. No, Jarod!
- Happy Halloween.
<i>Jarod. Ja-Jarod.</i>
Jarod! Jarod!
<i>Jarod!</i>
[Cackling]
[High-pitched Vocalizing]
[Laughing]
I can imagine.
Perhaps that's his way
of dispensing emotional justice.
<i>How's any of this</i>
<i>gonna help you find him?</i>
Oh, you helped me
a great deal already.
<i>You told me who he is...</i>
<i>and what he is.</i>
[Chuckles]
And, oh, yes...
I'll catch him.
[Whirring]
<i>Mr. Lee here.</i>
<i>After interviewing the first few subjects...</i>
<i>I'm finding Jarod</i>
<i>even more challenging...</i>
<i>than initially anticipated.</i>
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
Jarod, I'll never be able to do this.
Sure you can.
We'll keep on practicing.
His desire to help other people
and his determination for justice...
are unyielding.
[Chuckles]
But they will also prove
to be his downfall.
Mmm.
- [Typing]
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- <i>[Typing Continues]</i>
In many ways, Jarod is the most
compassionate man I've met.
<i>It's almost as if it's</i>
<i>his natural state ofbeing.</i>
- <i>[Mr. Lee] How is that, Miss Granger?</i>
- <i>He has a way of connecting...</i>
with others-
to their souls-
in a way that I've never seen
in any other person.
- It's ironic, really.
- Ironic?
He can be so <i>there</i>
for other people.
And yet inside,
he's so alone.
I'll never forget the day
he walked into my office.
<i>[Granger] Mrs. Morgan, we may</i>
<i>have a sighting on your daughter.</i>
<i>If all goes well, you should have your arms</i>
<i>around Catherine by tomorrow night.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>God bless you too.</i>
How can I help you?
I don't know who I am.
<i>[Granger] As I looked</i>
<i>in his eyes, I could feel his pain...</i>
- his sadness.
- So, Jarod came to you...
- for help.
- <i>Yes. That's what I do-</i>
<i>reunite families,</i>
<i>find missing children.</i>
<i>I help people find their pasts,</i>
<i>so they can have a future.</i>
- <i>[Mr. Lee] I see.</i>
- I thought I'd seen it all...
until I heard Jarod's story.
- I'm looking for my parents.
- Are they still alive?
I don't know.
I was never told the truth.
Well, why not use the police database
to initiate a search?
I can't. Look, this is probably
gonna be hard to understand...
but I don't have
much time- 72 hours.
- Without a name-
- I have a picture.
It's my mother. At least,
that's what I was told.
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.
<i>So, you were able to giveJarod</i>
<i>the identity ofhis mother.</i>
No. These people came
and took the information.
They destroyed it beforeJarod
even had a chance to see it.
That must have
decimated his soul.
Actually, it seemed to inspire him...
to help other people
who experienced a similar loss.
- Really?
- Over the last three years...
he's helped me
locate and reunite...
<i>nine children</i>
<i>with their families.</i>
And each time,
he refuses to take...
any credit or recognition
for what he's done.
- A very resilient soul.
- <i>Like I said...</i>
Jarod's the most compassionate
human being I've ever met.
<i>[Foghorn Blowing]</i>
<i>[Foghorn Blowing]</i>
<i>[Buoy Ringing]</i>
<i>You were right.</i>
<i>It wasn't that hard to track Mr. Lee.</i>
I mean, most people you talk to have
never seen an old blind Chinese guy.
<i>Well, at least</i>
<i>not since</i> Kung Fu.
Well done, Grasshopper.
[Clears Throat]
I found out...
Mr. Lee's a pretty infamous guy
in Hong Kong as well.
Not only does he find people, but he
makes them disappear in little pieces.
<i>If we play our cards right,</i>
<i>we'll bring him in in one piece.</i>
- Let's move.
- Get in position.
<i>[Sam]</i>
<i>Yes sir, Mr. Lyle.</i>
- It's more difficult than I thought.
- <i>[Typing]</i>
I'm learning thatJarod
is very complex-
very yin and yang...
dangerous and yet in control...
full of great pain...
but a source of healing
to others.
[Chuckles]
Yes.
He's, uh, capable
of bringing justice...
against the powerful
and yet showing mercy to the weak.
He helps the lost
to find themselves...
<i>but is unable to discover</i>
<i>his own true nature.</i>
[Chuckles]
- Ironic, isn't it?
- <i>[Typing Continues]</i>
Anna?
I think we have visitors.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>We need to move.</i>
Patience, Parker. The Sweepers
aren't even in position yet.
Lee has no idea we're out here. You start
stumbling around, and you're gonna blow it all.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
We're gonna go in...
<i>and bring out</i>
<i>the blind man.</i>
<i>Let me show you</i>
<i>how this is done.</i>
<i>[Door Opens, Bell Chimes]</i>
You idiot, we've been made.
Get in!
- <i>[Engine Starts]</i>
- <i>Miss Parker, that's a wall.</i>
Yeah, and this is a rental.
- <i>[Tires Screeching]</i>
- Whoa! Whoa!
[Tires Screeching]
<i>Damn!</i>
<i>He was right here!</i>
- So, this is how it's done?
- Outside! He couldn't have gotten far.
- Wow. Mr. Lee's like a Shaolin priest.
- What are you talking about?
Well, you know,
"Look, for he cannot be seen.
- Felt, for he cannot be touched."
- Oh, get a life, Kato.
<i>What's this?</i>
<i>Braille. Great.</i>
- In case you've forgotten.
- What is it, Syd?
Names
of people involved with Jarod.
- Why?
- He's been interviewing them.
- How would Mr. Lee know
about them in the first place?
- Someone at the Centre.
Broots, I want you to trace all calls
coming into and out of this warehouse.
Let's find out who Mr. Lee's
working for and why.
- Okay.
- Sydney, who do you think they are?
Whoever they are, these must be
some very special people.
- Love the shoes.
- Thank you very much.
<i>Do you always wear that...</i>
<i>getup?</i>
Well, I can see
you don't fully appreciate...
<i>the incredible burden</i>
<i>of my responsibility.</i>
<i>You'll have to excuse Mr. Lyle.</i>
[Sucks Teeth]
He's not a fan.
<i>But I am, Bernie.</i>
<i>And I do appreciate you taking time...</i>
<i>out of your busy schedule</i>
<i>to talk to us.</i>
Well, I always got time
to spend with a pretty lady.
[Chuckles]
<i>Tell us, what did Mr. Lee</i>
<i>want to know aboutJarod?</i>
[Sighs]
How I felt about him...
<i>minute by minute,</i>
<i>from the very instant we met.</i>
<i>Now don't you little ladies forget.</i>
<i>Come and see my show tonight.</i>
There's no cover, there's no minimum,
and there's free hot...
- <i>[Women Squealing]</i>
- <i>hors d'oeuvres, huh?</i>
- I'll see y'all later. Bye-bye.
- Bye!
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
[Grunts]
Hey, there, teddy bear.
You comin' to rub elbows
with the King of Rock and Roll?
No, I'm tryin'
to understand this.
You dress up
in a rented costume...
- and you pretend to be a dead singer?
- "Singer"?
Son, do you have any idea
who I am?
- Well, actually, I would-
- You are looking at a national monument-
Mount Rushmore
in blue suede shoes.
<i>There's not a human bein'</i>
<i>on God's green earth...</i>
that has ever demanded
the attention and respect...
of the man you are lookin' at
this very moment.
Hey, Bernie? Some guy
at the craps table says...
- he'll give you five bucks to goose his wife.
- I'll be right there.
Well, my fans beckon.
I must go.
Thank you very much.
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>
<i>I'd read Jarod all wrong at first.</i>
- How so?
- Well, just like I told Mr. Lee...
<i>it turned out that</i>
<i>he was the only person...</i>
who really cared about
what I was goin' through.
Hey.
<i>Well, welcome</i>
<i>to the Heartbreak Hotel.</i>
[Laughs] What are you doing here?
You should be on stage.
Oh, no. There-There's
no more stage for the King.
The casino fired me.
Did it have something to do
with that bird thing?
- Bird thing?
- The goose.
No. No, they said they'd
had complaints about the show.
<i>So I put on 20, 30 pounds. You think</i>
<i>it's easy bein'the idol of millions?</i>
- I would guess no.
- <i>Well, you're damn right it isn't.</i>
I sacrificed everything.
I did it 'cause I loved it.
It's what the people wanted.
<i>I just wish some of those casino bigwigs</i>
<i>could spend one hour wearin'the cape, huh?</i>
Just one hour.
I tell you what-They'd walk away singin'
a different tune. I guaran-damn-tee you.
<i>Couldn't you get a job
at another casino?
No, buddy boy.
After 24 years
of makin' people smile...
singin' the songs and...
spreadin'
the good vibrations...
afraid it's the end
of the line for the King.
<i>We did have one hell</i>
<i>of a ride, though, didn't we?</i>
- I bet you did.
- Now, look. I'm- I'm sorry. L-
I'm spillin' my guts
and I don't even know your name.
Jarod... Felson.
Bernie Baxley.
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Bernie Baxley.
Thanks.
Jarod?
I'm scared.
- Of what?
- Him.
<i>Jarod helped me</i>
<i>to face my fears...</i>
to find me again.
<i>L- I got to admit, he, uh,</i>
<i>kind of rubbed off on me a little bit.</i>
But I'll tell ya-
I think I rubbed off on him a little bit too.
[As Elvis]
Well, thank you very much.
<i>After that, I left Vegas.</i>
<i>Never looked back.</i>
<i>And thanks toJarod,</i>
<i>I've got my own place in Branson...</i>
where the King's legacy
is kept alive 363 days a year...
closed only for New Year's
and, of course, the King's birthday.
Ow. I threw out my hip
dancin' about a year ago.
ButJarod had taught me
that you gotta keep on adaptin'.
You know, keep-
keep lookin' for new and-
and better ways to move
and groove forward.
<i>So I broadened</i>
<i>my repertoire.</i>
Thought maybe I'd treat you folks
to, well, just a taste of my new act.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please welcome to the stage...</i>
Tiny King.
<i>Huh?</i>
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
Hey, TK, don't you want to say
somethin' to the pretty lady?
Ooh, you look better than a fried
peanut butter and banana sandwich.
- [Chuckles]
- [Forced Chuckle]
- Thank you very much.
- [Laughs]
<i>[Chuckling]</i>
Sam? Get him out of here
before I step on his blue suede face.
Yes, Miss Parker.
Excuse me, King?
- Yeah?
- It's time to leave the building.
Ah!
- Got to TCB.
- [Clucks Tongue]
You did say
these people must be... special.
What the hell
is going on, Sydney?
Lee has been interviewing
every one of those people...
about their emotional connection
toJarod...
in order to anticipate...
his next move.
Miss Parker.
Uh- Uh-
- What is it?
- I traced the last call from Mr. Lee's warehouse...
<i>to the Centre, and you won't believe</i>
<i>where it ended up.</i>
- Spit it out, Broots.
- Well, it went to your father's office.
- <i>[Footsteps]</i>
- Mmm. [Chuckles]
Uh-huh. Yes.
The next subject may be
reluctant to cooperate.
- Let <i>me</i> bring him in.
- [Chuckles, Speaks Chinese]
Violence was not
on your résumé.
[Chuckles]
I'll have to write a new one.
Hmm.
[Reads Aloud In Chinese]
Trouble?
Oh, yeah.
The battery's busted or something.
Oh, well,
maybe I can help.
- Really? You don't mind?
- Um...
I'm not much of a mechanic,
but I am pretty good with my hands.
[Groans]
<i>[Handcuffs Rattling]</i>
- Ah. Mr. Lee.
- [Speaks Chinese]
<i>I believe you have met</i>
<i>my assistant, Anna.</i>
Met her?
She kidnapped me.
<i>Oh, really?</i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>
<i>Please, sit down.</i>
I don't feel like
sitting down.
Oh. Excuse my urgency...
<i>but it is important</i>
<i>that I know about...</i>
your relationship
with Jarod.
Really? Well, I'd like to know
about your relationship with Jarod.
Mr. Lyle,
in life it is primary...
<i>that one knows</i>
<i>his position.</i>
<i>And you, sir, are not</i>
<i>in position to ask questions.</i>
Look, I don't know
what you're up to...
but I think it's time somebody
taught you some manners.
[Grunts]
[Groans]
<i>[Lyle Grunts]</i>
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I hurt you?
It is not only with sight
that one sees.
Let me help you.
- Once again, Mr Lyle, go sit down.
- [Grunts]
- <i>And tell me your story. Hmm?</i>
- [Grunts]
- What do you want to know?
- I want to know...
what motivates Jarod...
why he risks himself
to help others...
why he runs...
but does not vanish.
Well, why do you think
I can help you?
<i>Coochie, coochie, coochie, coochie.
[Laughs]
Because you have a very
unique relationship with Jarod.
You did try to kill him,
did you not?
All in the interest of science.
- <i>[Instruments Beeping]</i>
- Clear!
<i>Clear!</i>
- It really wasn't my idea anyway.
- [Laughing]
- It really wasn't my idea anyway.
- [Laughing]
I believe you also
kidnapped Jarod. Huh?
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.
"Desperate times call
for desperate measures," Anna.
So, you weren't content
just to kidnapJarod, were you?
You also have to shoot
his brother and kill him.
That was an accident,
pure and simple.
This is beautiful!
It's just one big happy family, isn't it?
It's the end
of the line, Lyle.
There's no place
left for you to run.
I'm disappointed in you, Jarod. You know
me better than that. Drop the cannon, kid.
- Shoot him, you moron!
- Shut up!
<i>Stay back, or I put</i>
<i>a very large hole in big brother.</i>
- Kyle.
- <i>Threats and pain...</i>
that's all
you've ever offered us.
You stole our lives,
and you killed our spirit...
<i>and now you think you can</i>
<i>threaten us with death?</i>
It doesn't matter, Lyle.
Because we never made a difference anyway.
I'll kill him.
I swear I will.
And then I'll kill you.
Don't do this,
little brother.
- [Grunts]
- [Groans]
[Yells]
[Kyle Groans]
There's another part
about what drives Jarod that l-l-
I don't understand.
- And that is?
- [Chuckles]
Why, after all
you've done to him...
he has not killed you.
After all...
he is more resourceful
and intelligent than you are.
Maybe he just likes me.
Not.
[Chuckles]
Shall we start from the beginning,
all over again, huh?
- <i>[Miss Parker] Where the hell is Lyle?</i>
- <i>[Sydney] I don't know...</i>
<i>but he seemed genuinely</i>
<i>disturbed over the revelation...</i>
that Mr. Lee is in contact
with your father's office.
Well, we're not
waiting any longer.
- Let's go ahead and talk to this guy.
- Hmm.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hi,J.R.
My name is Sydney. This is Miss Parker.
<i>Miss Parker?</i>
<i>You sure look familiar.</i>
I have one of those faces.
Listen,J. <i>R...</i>
it's very important that you tell us exactly
what Mr. Lee wanted to know aboutJarod.
Is Jarod
in some kind of trouble?
- He might be.
- I'll do anything to help him.
He saved my life twice.
Once before I even met him.
J. R? Honey?
Sweetie, can you hear me? J. R?
- [Jarod] He's in shock.
- Wake up.
- He's still breathing.
- <i>[Mother] He's hypoglycemic.</i>
- When was the last time he ate?
- He had cereal for breakfast three, four hours ago.
J. R? Come on, honey.
What do you think
you're doing?
I need to stabilize his blood sugar.
Stick this in your mouth.
I want you to let it dissolve, okay?
Good boy.
- Mom?
- Oh! Oh!
It's okay, honey.
Everything's gonna be okay.
<i>Mr. Lee seemed real interested</i>
<i>in the fact thatJarod knew I was sick.</i>
- Your heart.
- <i>I needed a transplant.</i>
My mom had pretty much
given up hope that I'd get one in time...
untilJarod came into our lives.
- How is he feeling?
- <i>[Mother] Better.</i>
He has a heart condition.
I noticed the bluish tint
to his fingertips and his lips.
<i>I'd say by the looks of it,</i>
<i>you have a very sick boy.</i>
- Are you a doctor?
- Not at the moment.
<i>Why hasn't he had</i>
<i>a heart transplant?</i>
Because he's on a waiting list.
Because he has AB-negative blood,
which is very rare.
- It only happens in certain families.
- One in 300,000.
<i>I know.</i>
<i>I have it too.</i>
You said Jarod
saved your life twice.
He found me a heart.
You stay with me, little brother.
I'm gonna get you to a hospital.
[Weakly]
It's too late, Jarod.
Don't you say that.
<i>Look at me!</i>
<i>Come on, just-just think-</i>
<i>Think about all the good times</i>
<i>we're gonna have together.</i>
- I'm sorry, Jarod.
- For what?
F-For everything.
<i>[Kyle Gasps]</i>
No.
[Sobs]
- Jarod gave you his brother's heart.
- <i>Yeah.</i>
And ever since
the transplant, he calls.
<i>Notjust to check up on me...</i>
- but to see how I'm really doing.
- Mmm.
<i>Jarod's like the older brother</i>
<i>that I never had.</i>
Mr. Lee seemed to think
that was real important.
Thank you,J.R.
Sam will take you home.
<i>Come on, Tin Man.
<i>[Basketball Bouncing]</i>
Mr. Lee's
really narrowing it down.
<i>Compassion, empathy,
desire for justice-
all the things
that makeJarod, Jarod.
Do you think he'll be able
to anticipateJarod's next move...
- to actually catch him?
- Unless we get there first.
- <i>[Metal Clanging]</i>
- Miss Parker? Miss Parker.
[Clears Throat] About that phone call
from Lee to your father's office?
- What about it?
- Well, it wasn't actually for Mr. Parker.
Well, did it go
to his office or didn't it?
Yes. Tech-
I mean, technically, yes.
- Technically?
- Well, there was a second phone line...
recently installed
in your father's suite.
It seems now he's sharing
his office with someone else.
<i>And I traced the call</i>
<i>from Mr. Lee to that new line.</i>
And just whose new line
might that be, as if I didn't know?
- Brigitte.
- Well, why did I even ask?
Hold on, she's not there. I, uh-
[Clears Throat]
L-I just intercepted another call
between her and Mr. Lee.
She just left in a limo.
Mr. Lee's limo.
<i>They're goin'to getJarod.</i>
<i>[Mr. Lee]</i>
<i>We're going to getJarod now.</i>
- So, tell me how you found him.
- Simple.
- <i>[Typing]</i>
- By interviewing people whose lives
Jarod has touched...
I've been able
to understand how he thinks.
And more importantly,
how he feels.
<i>We were able to break the code-</i>
<i>the pattern ofhis behavior.</i>
Jarod has a need to defend
those abused by power.
Because of this need,
he's drawn to predictable situations.
- Such as?
- Those that are related...
to the trauma of his childhood, and the guilt
he feels over the abuse of his work.
Anna has extensively researched
potential scenarios...
that would attract him.
We've successfully isolated
the one that will lead us to him.
It's a shame my future stepchildren
won't be there to share the moment.
- [Chuckles]
- [Giggles]
- You're deliciously naughty. [Laughs]
- [Giggling]
Why, thank you,
Mr. Lee.
<i>A blind Chinese guy,</i>
<i>a bimbo and a limousine-</i>
how hard can that be to find?
[Slams Down Receiver]
Two and a half years
we've been chasing Jarod...
and that bitch
is gonna bring him in.
<i>Lyle, are you all right?</i>
<i>You look terrible.</i>
- You ought to see the other guy.
- Bad hair day?
I was abducted by...
several of Lee's men.
<i>They obviously</i>
<i>got the best of me, but I...</i>
put a whole lot of hurtin'
on 'em in the process.
<i>Lee questioned me for hours,</i>
<i>but finally gave up.</i>
Had his enforcers drop me off
in the middle of nowhere.
[Clucks Tongue] Oh.
Well, you can thank Bridget...
- for your quality time with Lee.
- Brigitte?
- [Affirmative Grunt]
- He's working for her.
<i>Yeah. She's gonna bring Jarod in.</i>
Well, not if we get there first.
I've triangulated the signal
from Brigitte's cell phone.
<i>And this should lead us</i>
<i>right to Brigitte and to Mr. Lee.</i>
Oh, and they'll lead us
right toJarod.
[Laughs]
- <i>[Chattering]</i>
- [Beeping]
[Computerized Voice]
Thank you, Jarod.
You're welcome.
Abner gets to come home
where he should have been all the time.
How can we ever repay you
for all you have done for us?
- This is repayment enough.
- Oh.
Good luck, Abner.
<i>[Brigitte]</i>
<i>Ironic place to find Jarod.</i>
A genius at a facility
for the mentally challenged.
Yes, Jarod has discovered
that many of the residents...
have been intentionally
misdiagnosed.
<i>The director keeps them here</i>
<i>in order to defraud their insurance...</i>
and their parents.
They're trapped- prisoners in an
institution that denies them their freedom.
And Jarod's here to liberate them.
How noble.
- Wait.
- <i>[Helicopter Approaching]</i>
No. No, no, no, no!
I don't believe this!
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Good to see you too.
- Where is he?
- I'm supposed to bring him in!
- Like hell you are.
- Nobody's cuttin' me out of this,
least of all you.
<i>Stop your arguing!</i>
<i>We must get toJarod now!</i>
He's gone.
You have a gift
for the obvious.
He knew
we were coming.
<i>He's known all along.</i>
Intercepted your memo.
- What memo?
- From Brigitte to Daddy...
<i>requesting the unique services</i>
<i>of Mr. Lee to catch Jarod.</i>
- He couldn't have done this alone.
- You blew it, angel.
<i>[Mr. Lee]</i>
<i>Someone informed him of our presence.</i>
Anna.
<i>[Helicopter Rotors Whirring]</i>
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for all of your help.</i>
After all the people
you've helped...
it was about time
that someone helped you.
What you did took a lot of courage.
You bought me the time I needed.
I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I mean,
what you did for my family and my nephew-
I'm the one who should
be thanking you.
- I hope someday we'll meet again.
- I hope so too.
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Two pair is the power.</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Ah, like candy from babies.</i>
Well, I'm in for 50.
Zipper?
Oh, with a pair of ducks?
I'm out.
- How 'bout it, smokey?
- <i>Very charming.</i>
Kiss your mother with that mouth?
Fold.
Well, I guess
it's you and me, big time.
I'm gonna see the bet.
I need kegger money.
[Laughing]
I'll see your 50...
and I'll raise you 50.
- He's got the flush, Lou.
- Not a chance.
Eleven spades played.
That leaves two left in the deck.
You only need one.
All right.
I will see your 50
and bump you 200.
Oh, looks like you're
a little light, mister.
Well, l- I don't have
any more cash with me.
I do have my watch.
Will that work?
Let's see.
This is an Omega Seamaster.
- <i>Well, it's gotta be worth at least four grand.</i>
- It's worth six.
And I'll give it to you
for the $327 bet...
and... your hat.
- You want my hat?
- Mm-hmm.
<i>All you have to do</i>
<i>is call the bet.</i>
<i>There's a reason they call aces and eights</i>
<i>a dead man's hand, Wild Bill.</i>
Do you mind, smokey?
Excuse me.
The watch is ticking.
Last call for Hartford,
Boston and Albany at Bay 7.
<i>All aboard!</i>
He's got the flush, Lou.
Just cut your losses. Let's get on the bus.
- Shut up.
- <i>Tick, tick, tick, tick.</i>
<i>Tick, tick.</i>
- Fine. Take it.
- Okay.
- [Sighs]
- Let's go, Zipper.
- <i>[Woman] You boys stop by any time.</i>
- Hey, mister.
- <i>Did you have the flush?</i>
- Do you really want to know?
- Nah.
- Have a good trip.
[Laughing]
[Laughing]
Hell of a bluff, sweetie.
Where did you learn to play cards?
I read this book.
It's very good.
- <i>[Bell Dinging]</i>
- Excuse me? I need a ticket.
Uh, your first thing out, please.
I got a turnaround to Baltimore
leaves in 10 minutes.
Perfect. Thank you.
You want to get on a bus,
ride for an hour and come right back?
The bathroom.
Do you have a bathroom?
It's in the back.
All right, Rachel.
Time to come out of there.
- I'm not running away.
- A bus station? This looks very bad.
<i>I just need time to think. I don't-</i>
<i>I don't- I don't have any luggage.</i>
- You know what's at stake here?
- Yes, I know.
<i>Why don't you open the door, and we can</i>
<i>settle this like decent human beings?</i>
You got three seconds, bitch,
or I take you where you sit.
Hey!
<i>I believe this is the ladies'room.</i>
Ow. You can come out now.
- Is he dead?
- I don't think so.
Oh, do you have any idea
what you've just done?
Helped you?
Mind your own business!
You could get somebody killed!
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
"We are pleased to announce
our engagement.
Join us in celebrating
our newfound bliss."
Oh, excuse me, but this is
whacked with a capital "Y."
- Boys?
- It is the Centre.
Strange bedfellows,
for richer or poorer.
Anything new from the bus station?
Uh, we're still running the information.
Jarod was all over those surveillance cameras,
and he never got on a bus.
Yeah. Right.
Well, no, I have a team on top of it.
<i>Um, Miss Parker.</i>
I was wondering if maybe I can get
out of here. I have a date tonight.
- A date?
- <i>Yeah.</i> Charlene Reynolds.
<i>She works over in Accounting.</i>
She's very nice, actually,
except for the tooth.
<i>I also have plans.</i>
Another trip to the Chuckle Hut?
Mary Winfield. She's giving a reading
from her new book of poetry.
- Sounds like a hoot.
- What are you doing tonight, Miss Parker?
Good night.
<i>[Elevator Bell Dings]</i>
- <i>[Machine Beeps]</i>
- <i>Hi, this is Rachel.</i>
<i>The kids and I can't come</i>
<i>to the phone right now.</i>
<i>Leave a message, and we'll</i>
<i>call you right back. Right, gang?</i>
- <i>[Children] Right!</i>
- <i>Tha-Tha-Tha-That's all, folks!</i>
<i>[Machine Beeps]</i>
Are you stupid?
Did you forget what I told you?
Funny, it's all
coming back to me now.
Turn around.
Slowly!
What are you doing in my house?
- I got your address-
- That hand disappears, so do you.
My pocket.
Where did you get this?
Off your friend
at the bus station.
- Did the company send you?
- The bus company?
You want to play games,
I'm gonna shoot you right here.
In front of your children?
<i>You have a beautiful family.</i>
<i>Where are they?</i>
- <i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>
- [Gasps]
Yes?
I wasn't running.
I wouldn't.
You're telling me
he's not one of yours?
No. No, I understand.
I said I understand. Di-
Please tell me what's going on.
Rock Creek Park, 10:00 a.m.
<i>Oh, yes, I will. I'll be there.</i>
[Sighs]
- <i>[Sighs] What's your name?</i>
- Jarod.
- Turn around, Jarod.
- I'd really rather not.
<i>Turn around.</i>
Have you ever felt completely alone...
like you're in a dark room,
and you can't find the door?
My whole life.
That's what they've done to me.
They've taken away the light.
[Grunts]
I'm sorry.
[Sighs]
[Whispering]
What am I gonna do?
What the hell-
What do you two want?
Think of me as the United Nations...
holding peace talks
to avoid a full-scale war.
Don't worry. I would never attack
an unarmed person.
[Giggling]
You know better than that.
<i>Besides, I think baby sister and I
<i>can reach an accord on our own.</i>
<i>Can't we, love?
We can die tryin'.
Thought you quit.
Actually, I was just about
to clean out my desk...
which is what I'd like to get back to,
if you two don't mind.
<i>You really should get a personal life.</i>
Your father and I have
a very special relationship.
<i>Someday I hope you find</i>
<i>the happiness that we share.</i>
How could you let this happen?
Hey, it's just as strange for me
as it is for you...
that our father's marrying Brigitte.
Hell, I slept with her myself.
Look, just because you
haven't found happiness...
that doesn't mean you should
deny it to those around you.
Hmm?
[Groans]
<i>[Sighs]</i>
<i>Damn.</i>
<i>[Man] Hot dogs and pretzels here.</i>
<i>Get your hot dogs and pretzels.</i>
<i>[Carousel]</i>
<i>[Bell Rings]</i>
That bruise looks painful.
Where's your hero?
What do you want?
Take the case under the bench.
- What's in it?
- Shut up.
There's a room waiting for you
at the Chester Hotel.
The reservation's
under the name Andrews.
Take the case and wait there.
I've done everything you've asked.
<i>Can I at least just see them?
If it were my call,
I'd shoot you in the head right here.
I'll stay in touch.
Will she or won't she?
<i>Only her cardiologist knows for sure.</i>
You should probably stock up on red meat
and doughnuts while you're at it.
I mean, why waste
a perfectly good heart attack?
- Have we met?
- Thomas Gates. Friends call me Tommy.
So, what do your friends call you?
- I don't have any friends.
- Oh.
Two years, three months, 21 days.
- What?
- That's how long it's been
since I've had a cigarette.
- How 'bout you?
- I stopped counting. Damn it.
- Do you believe in fate?
- Oh, please.
<i>Come on.
A sensible ex-smoker risks her hard-earned
two and a quarter to rejoin the nicotine club.
A vending machine malfunctions,
giving a stranger...
in- in jeans and Pendleton...
time to convince her that she doesn't
really want to belong to that club.
Fate.

[Gasps]
Now, why would someone run away
from the people they loved?
Who are you?
Someone who's trying to help you
find your light again.
And what were you planning
to do with this?
Get my children back.
<i>It was called the M2 Project.</i>
I was 22 when they recruited me
from the University of Virginia.
- "They"? Meaning the company?
- The company.
Why was the C.I.A. Interested
in college students?
We were computer analysts,
tops of the class.
They took us and trained us
in the creation of covert simulations.
- Simulations?
- <i>Hypothetical scenarios.</i>
<i>Kidnapping, sabotage, assassination.</i>
They told us that the files were
being created for training situations.
How many people
were involved in this M2?
Five, including me.
We all had military background.
I was R.O. <i>T.C.</i>
So, you can obviously
handle a firearm.
My father was
a champion target shooter.
I was a better shot than him.
[Sighs]
I started reading stories
in the newspaper...
of bombings, terrorist assaults,
political murders...
<i>and I recognized them from the files</i>
<i>that we thought up.</i>
You have no idea what that's like, to know
people are dying from something you thought up.
To have so much innocent blood
on your hands.
I understand.
I begged for a transfer...
and Renfro looked at me
like I'd asked him to give up a kidney.
- Renfro?
- Alex E.
The man in charge of M2.
So, what happened?
I started to ingest
small amounts of poison.
<i>Commercial pesticides.</i>
After a month
of throwing up on my desk...
Renfro actually signed
the transfer papers himself.
- Where's your husband?
- He walked out on us after Zach was born.
So, after 10 years with no contact
with anyone at M2...
out of nowhere,
they take your children?
It was 10 days ago.
<i>I was finishing the dishes.</i>
<i>Melinda and Zachary were</i>
<i>at the table drawing pictures.</i>
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- <i>I heard a knock at the front door.</i>
<i>Not unusual. We get salespeople</i>
<i>in our area all the time.</i>
- [Barking]
- <i>Then Maggie, our dog,</i>
<i>started barking in the backyard.</i>
- <i>[Knocking Continues]</i>
- <i>When I heard the knocking again, l-</i>
<i>I asked the kids to check on her,</i>
<i>and I went to answer the door.</i>
<i>When I opened it and there was</i>
<i>no one there, my heart stopped instantly.</i>
<i>I knew there was something wrong.</i>
<i>I went running to the back of the house,</i>
<i>and the kids were gone.</i>
Zachary! Melinda!
[Sighs]
I got a call a few minutes later.
I didn't recognize the voice, but...
the message was certainly clear-
I do exactly what they say,
or they kill my children.
I don't know who
they want me to shoot!
They'll tell you when they're ready.
- <i>[Bell Dinging]</i>
- [Horn Honks]
I think the guy's in the bathroom.
Too much applejack.
- Here, let me get that for you.
- I can do it myself.
Thank you.
So, you live up on Bryer, don't you?
<i>Careful.
They have stalking laws in this state.
<i>I'm restoring the split-level</i>
<i>just north of you.</i>
That dump on the hill?
There's nothing quite like
discovering a 17 th-century hardwood floor...
<i>under a sheet oflime green linoleum.</i>
I can only imagine.
Don't you have any passions,
Miss Parker?
- You know my name.
- People talk.
"Gates' Restoration.
'Where everything old is new again."'
I wrote that myself.
Move over, Hemingway.
Well...
you have yourself a nice day,
Miss Parker.
I have a feeling you deserve one.
<i>So, the camel says, "Hump her?</i>
I don't even know her!"
Hump her.
- It's a- It's a good joke.
- Broots, I need your help.
- That joke always kills.
- Focus, Shecky.
- Okay.
- Thomas Michael Gates.
- Yeah?
- I want you to run him through the system-
personal history, family background,
the whole nine yards.
And I want this information
delivered to my office A.S.A.P.
All right. Who is he?
The quicker, the better.
Miss Parker,
did you hear the one about the coyote...
the, uh- the jackal
and the one-eyed armadillo?
<i>[Nervous Chuckle]</i>
Oh, well.
Rachel?
I downloaded this picture
from the federal archives.
- Do you recognize anyone?
- <i>That's Alex Renfro.</i>
- Hmm.
- What?
I ran a background check on him.
He's suspected in at least
a half a dozen political assassinations...
and the F.B.I. Had him
on their internal top-10 list.
Why "had"?
Alex Renfro died in a bus crash
in Honduras in 1995.
<i>I also ran a background check</i>
<i>on all the other M2 members.</i>
Each one of them is dead,
along with their families.
- Each death ruled accidental.
- Oh, my God.
Each M2 death...
<i>was preceded within 48 hours</i>
<i>by a political assassination.</i>
They're doing the same thing to me.
After you do this job...
they're going to kill you
and your family.
<i>[Jarod] All right.</i>
<i>Let's go over this one more time.</i>
We know that Renfro and the other
members of the M2 unit are dead.
But was there anyone else that you can think
of that somehow might have been involved?
Nobody.
Think hard.
Don't you think I have?
Do you have any idea
what a nightmare my life has become?
Ten days ago I was planning P.T.A. Meetings
and making cookies for a bake sale!
Now I'm sitting here waiting for someone
to tell me who I'm supposed to kill!
I'm sorry.
Maybe we should take a little break.
- Who are you?
- What do you mean?
You-You rescue me in a bathroom
like some phantom out of the night.
<i>You access classified files</i>
<i>like it's nothing.</i>
And you seem to feel what I feel
before I feel it.
- <i>Who are you?</i>
- I'm just a guy waitin' for a bus.
<i>[Knocking]</i>
<i>[Knocking Continues]</i>
I'm standin' out here
like an idiot pizza boy.
I was in the bathroom.
I'm sorry.
You've made the place very homey.
Not much of a view.
- <i>I hadn't noticed.</i>
- Ooh, relax.
<i>You look guilty,</i>
<i>and you haven't even killed anybody yet.</i>
What's this?
<i>Open it.</i>
- Where are you going?
- The bathroom.
Do you mind?
<i>Senator Sanford Ryst.</i>
<i>He's givin'a speech</i>
<i>at Slayton Hall tonight.</i>
<i>He's arriving there for a rehearsal</i>
<i>in exactly one hour.</i>
<i>[Toilet Flushes]</i>
What am I supposed to do?
<i>We've arranged access</i>
<i>through a side service door.</i>
As Reest finishes the rehearsal,
you will shoot him once through the forehead.
Nice towels.
Why?
Don't mess up...
Mom.
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>
We're gonna have to stop meetin' like this.
People will talk.
Well, people talk.
I don't usually pay much
attention to them myself.
That's good advice.
So, it looks like we're gonna
have a full moon tonight.
I hear that happens almost monthly.
Right. Right.
Look, I know this is
a little abrupt, but, uh...
I was gonna take a drive out to the bluffs
and try out my new telescope.
Would you like to join me?
Was that the worst pick-up line
in the history of pick-up lines?
So, you-you want to come?
Do I look like a "hangin' out in the woods"
kind of gal to you?
Well, uh, not in those shoes, no...
but, uh, you never can tell...
when people are ready
to dive into a new experience.
Know what I mean?
Sorry to disturb you, Miss Parker,
but there's been a bit of an emergency.
- What kind of an emergency?
- The personal kind.
I'll see you back at the office.
Roommate?
I have to go. I'm sorry,
but this was a big mistake.
Look, I'll be up by Old Bridge Road
if you change your mind.
I won't.
- [Engine Starts]
- Gotta kick off those shoes one day, Parker.
<i>[Jarod] I would suggest</i>
<i>a second and third scenario.</i>
Automatic weapon fire from behind the building
over here, and a staged auto accident here.
<i>That would leave the transport-</i>
You'll never guess
who I just ran into.
- <i>[Monitor. Jarod Continues]</i>
- What are you doing?
Who do you work for?
- The <i>C.I.</i> A? The N.S. A? Who?
- This isn't what it looks like.
Good. 'Cause it looks like you've been
involved in some pretty ugly stuff.
- Rachel, I can explain-
- I trusted you!
I trusted you
with the lives of my children!
Alex Renfro is alive.
I just saw him outside of this hotel.
My guess is he's behind
everything that is happening to you.
- Get in the closet.
- You know what he's going to
do to you after this is over!
- I'm gonna talk to him. Get in.
- I can help you.
I'm gonna talk to him!
Get in!
Don't make me choose
between you and my children!
<i>You're making a mistake.</i>
My mistake.
<i>Rachel, listen to me!</i>
[Grunts]
Damn it.
- What do you think
you were doing out there?
- My job.
- By spying on me?
- By following orders.
Oh.
I have to admit-
[Giggles]
Thomas is cute.
<i>If you like that blue-collar...</i>
dirt-under-the-fingernails,
butt-crack refrigerator repairman type.
Why... are you
still involved in my life?
[Sighs]
Your father and I
love you very much.
- We only want what's best for you.
- Daddy ordered these?
You don't know a thing
about this man.
He could be a security risk...
not to mention a sexual deviant.
He's a carpenter.
So he says.
Now, the point is, you are not
to have further contact with him...
<i>until a complete</i>
<i>background check is finished.</i>
Mmm.
Was that an order?
From the highest level.
Don't fool yourself into thinking
you're like them, because you're not.
Never forget where you've
come from, Miss Parker.
Ever.
Okay.
Excuse me.
What the hell you doin' here?
<i>Is there anything above the control booth?</i>
<i>I'm with security.</i>
Uh, nothin' but the catwalk.
- How do I get up there?
- That way.
Joe, bring the houselights
down to a quarter.
God, please forgive me.
Rachel, don't do this.
[Gasps]
Stop. Stop!
You asked me once if I knew what it felt like
to have innocent blood on my hands.
I do.
<i>I try to run from it.</i>
I spend every day of my life
trying to make up for it.
- I'm afraid.
- <i>I know you are.</i>
<i>But if you pull that trigger,</i>
<i>if you kill this man...</i>
there'll be no life left
for you or your children.
I don't want to kill anybody.
I have to.
If there is a way
to save your children...
I'll find it or I'll die trying.
I promise you that.
Please?
Put down the rifle.
[Sobs]
[Exhales, Inhales Sharply]
You just saved his life.
I just killed my children.
<i>[Agent On Radio]</i>
<i>All units, Eagle 2 is on the go.</i>
<i>[Agent #2 On Radio] This is Columbia 5.</i>
<i>Copy that. Standing by.</i>
<i>[Agent #1 On Radio]</i>
<i>Secure parking lot.</i>
- Where are we going?
- I don't know yet.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- <i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>
Hello?
I am disappointed in you, Rachel.
- Renfro.
- Still quite the little problem solver,
aren't you?
Except you've created
a sizable dilemma for your children.
- Why didn't you just do what you were told?
- Please don't hurt them.
That's out of my control now.
I'll do anything!
L-l-I'll do anything!
Listen to me, Renfro.
There's a new player at the table.
The white knight
from the bus station.
I know you were behind
the M2 killings.
I know you faked your own death
to avert an F.B.I. Manhunt.
Is this the best hand you have?
I have a videotape of you taken this afternoon
outside the Chester Hotel.
I have Rachel, your last witness.
So, unless you return
the children, unharmed...
I am going to place a phone call to the F.B.I.
And tell them you are very much alive.
There won't be a hole on this planet
deep enough for you to crawl into.
- You have 30 seconds to make up your mind.
- [Beeps]
[Gasps]
What are you doing? Are you insane?
- He'll call back.
- What if he doesn't call back?
These are my children!
<i>Come on.
You have more innocent blood
on your hands.
[Rings]
- [Exhales]
- [Rings, Beeps]
Speak to me.
What's the play?
<i>With this guy, cautious.</i>
We meet Rachel, the white knight,
exchange the kids for the tapes.
<i>Then we follow them home,</i>
<i>and you kill them.</i>
- [Carousel]
- <i>[Chattering, Screaming]</i>
Rachel.
It's been a long time.
You look good.
Where are my children?
<i>Close. Very close.
The tape we talked about.
Now, where are the children?
What's to keep you from going to
the authorities after I turn them over?
I don't care what happens to you, Renfro.
I want my family.
I believe you.
- Oh!
- <i>Mommy! Mommy!</i>
Oh, come here!
- <i>I love you!</i>
- <i>[Rachel] Oh, my God!</i>
Our business appears to be done.
Be sure to check the tape.
I wouldn't want you to feel cheated.
[Engine Starts]
I won't forget this.
<i>[Door Closes]</i>
How are you, baby?
[Laughing]
<i>[Car Pulling Away]</i>
Before we get on
with the rest of our show...
I wanted to congratulate you on
your masterful hand of poker-
your use of low-profile assassins,
your own fake death...
to sever any connection
to the killings...
and your elimination of all witnesses
and their immediate families.
<i>Now, I realize that there was no way that you</i>
<i>were going to allow Rachel and her children...</i>
to just walk away...
<i>even after you got what you wanted.</i>
Like I said before-
[Cards Turning Over]
There's a new player at the table...
and I'm afraid you're not going to like
the hand you were just dealt.
Go ahead.
Open the envelope.
[Sighs]
Aces and eights.
Dead man's hand.
Which is exactly what you are.
<i>[Siren Wailing]</i>
<i>Oh, God.</i>
<i>[Police Radio Chatter, Indistinct]</i>
- Get out of the car!
- Let me see your hands!
- <i>Get 'em up!</i>
- <i>Hands in the air, now!</i>
<i>Get your hands up</i>
<i>and put 'em on the roof of the car!</i>
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
<i>[Ringing Continues]</i>
- What?
- [Jarod] It's midnight, Miss Parker.
- What a shock to find you still at the office.
- I was just on my way out.
I met a woman who reminds me of you.
- [Continues]
- She was smart, compassionate...
and tortured.
Is that what I am?
Like you, she was
a prisoner of her past...
of people who wanted
to control her future.
Instead of fighting back,
she almost let them destroy her.
Doesn't sound like a happy ending.
Oh, it all worked out in the end.
I hope the same thing happens for you.
- Meaning?
- Trust your heart, Miss Parker.
Don't let them
take away your happiness.
- [Continues]
- [Beeps]
I didn't think you'd come.
Tell me about yourself.
What do you want to know?
Everything.
[Thunderclap]
Strange how Jarod
left nothing in Hawaii...
as if he wanted us
out of the way.
Broots, find out
why we haven't landed.
- Please, don't make me get up.
- Since when do you hate to fly?
I don't hate to fly.
I hate to barf.
It's important.
<i>Jarod's trail's cold.</i>
<i>What could you possibly be late for?</i>
Unless your appointment
is not business but pleasure.
Are you this chatty
on commercial flights?
I'm a shrink.
What do you want?
So, what's his name?
You did call him from
Jarod's cabana, didn't you?
There was a certain glow
about you.
I don't glow, Sydney.
His name is Thomas,
and he's doing some work on my house.
- He's a fix-it man, Syd.
- What exactly is broken?
<i>[Cabin Door Opens, Closes]</i>
<i>The pilot says we're gonna</i>
<i>circle for an hour, maybe two.</i>
Thank you, Jarod.
And you just know he's down there
basking in the sun and surf.
- [Groans]
- Wake up, wiseass.
I wouldn't want you to sleep through this.
You're going in for a dip.
[Screaming]
No!
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent every moment
searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
<i>[Jarod Narrating]</i>
<i>Ever since I was a boy...</i>
<i>people have been telling me</i>
<i>that I'm special, that I have a gift-</i>
<i>that I could be</i>
<i>anything I want to be.</i>
<i>I never guessed</i>
<i>I would end up here-</i>
<i>in the Atlantic Ocean</i>
<i>as a human anchor.</i>
<i>But maybe I should start</i>
<i>at the beginning.</i>
<i>[Man On Microphone]</i>
<i>Oh, you're a lawyer, eh?</i>
- <i>[People Shouting, Laughing]</i>
- [Continues, Indistinct]
I says, "All lawyers are slime."
Guy next to me screams, "You take that back!"
<i>I said, "Why, are you a lawyer?"</i>
<i>He says, "No, I'm a slime."</i>
<i>[Narrating] The Comedy Slot-</i>
<i>where thejokes are as cheesy as the patrons.</i>
<i>Well, no one was laughing,</i>
<i>especially me.</i>
<i>I'd been tracking these</i>
<i>classified ads for weeks...</i>
<i>but I didn't know</i>
<i>who was placing them.</i>
<i>It was too obvious for a Centre trick,</i>
<i>but I had to be careful.</i>
<i>That's why I left no leads in Hawaii.</i>
<i>That's also why I should have turned and run</i>
<i>when I spotted the source of the ads.</i>
<i>Argyle.</i>
<i>He saved my life once,</i>
<i>then tried to sell me to the Centre.</i>
<i>[Comedian Continues, Indistinct]</i>
[Spits]
Hey! You call this a martini?
- You call this a martini?
I wouldn't feed this to my dog.
- <i>[Dog Yips]</i>
<i>And I said no olives, miss.</i>
<i>He's pimiento intolerant.</i>
<i>But even ifhe wasn't, I wouldn't let</i>
<i>this touch his little doggy lips.</i>
Know what I'm sayin'?
There's a good boy.
- She's a bad girl. She's a bad girl.
- <i>[Barking]</i>
- [Clears Throat]
- J-rod!
What's tricks, man? How you doin'?
I knew you'd get my message.
- Half the eastern seaboard got your message.
- Well, it worked, right?
- <i>[Growling]</i>
- Whoa. Dog, you rememberJarod.
You're in like Flynn, see?
Look at us three.
Reunited, and we're feelin' good.
Hey, you still carryin'
all them crazy I.D.'s?
- Whose skin you wearin' this week?
- A sucker's.
- Now, what do you want?
- What do I want? What do I want?
I want another couple of martinis.
Hold the olives.
Okay. What I want?
What I want is for everybody to get along.
- I want everybody to be happy.
- Starting with yourself.
Of course, but how much happier
can this snazzy boy be?
<i>Check me out.
I'm a fat cat down here.
<i>Me llaman El Gato Gordo,</i> dude.
- Who did you have to sell to get it?
- That's low. That is very low.
<i>Check this out.
Voom! I forgive you.
- How did you break your finger?
- Um, that? Job hazard.
That would require a job.
Now, what do you want?
Okay. Here's the story, all right?
There's this guy, Faddis, down here.
Mr. Sonny Faddis.
He's the entrepreneurial type.
He's actually a friend of mine.
Friends break bread, not fingers.
I know what you're saying
about the finger, but you're wrong.
He's got people
who do that for him, okay?
He provided me, recently,
with a little financial sustenance.
- How much do you owe him?
- $5,000.
<i>What? You went through all of this trouble</i>
<i>to get me down here for $5,000?</i>
Listen to me, Jarod.
This Mr. Sonny Faddis is bad news, okay?
He made me choose which finger
his goons would break.
I told him this one, 'cause you gotta
have a free picker, you know?
Thing is, Jarod,
if I don't pay this guy back...
Argyle is ancient history, man- phfft!
Besides, what's five large
between friends?
You tried to sell me for 10.
I know. I know what I did.
I know what I know.
I know what I did was wrong.
I also happen to know
that you, my friend...
and I are kindred spirits.
Don't give me that look.
We both know what it's like
to be alone in this world.
And we also both know what it's like
to have nobody to turn to.
You're all I got, Jarod.
<i>[Narrating] I was suddenly face-to-face</i>
<i>with my toughest pretend-</i>
<i>becoming Argyle's friend.</i>
[Whimpering]
You da man, Jarod.
- <i>I didn't need forged papers or a fake I.D.</i>
- You da man, Jarod.
Set us up with another
couple of drinks.
- <i>Just a lot of patience... and no common sense.</i>
- [Groans]
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>You seem anxious.</i>
Thomas must be doing
important fix-it work.
I met him a few weeks ago.
We spent a couple of hours
together one night.
Just talking.
- He used to work on Wall Street,
but he checked out.
- Hmm.
[Sighs]
He's renovating this absolutely
ancient house near mine.
He calls it a work in progress.
I got to thinking I needed
some work done on my house, so-
<i>[Sighing]</i>
<i>Well, I wish I could tell you...</i>
<i>having him over was just</i>
<i>about the water damage...</i>
<i>but... it was more.</i>
<i>[Exhales]</i>
<i>Well, it's definitely water damage.</i>
Yeah.
[Chuckles]
- This place is sweet though.
It's got a lot of character.
- Lot of years.
Yeah, but structure's great
and masonry out front.
- Mm-hmm.
- Own or rent?
It was a gift- given to me by my father
when I graduated college.
It was, uh, sort of
a hideaway for my parents.
<i>[Door Closes]</i>
That's gotta be Mom.
- I look just like her. I know.
- [Chuckles]
- She passed away when I was a little girl.
- Oh. Must have been tough.
Yeah.
Hey, you know what would
be perfect right here?
A lighter color.
Then we'll lose the stained glass
and the bay windows...
and get some light reflection comin' in-
brighten up the whole house.
Let's...
cover it with drywall
and a fresh coat of paint.
- Same color.
- Mm.
- What?
- [Laughing]
[Clears Throat]
You're a-You're a doer.
- A doer?
- Yeah.
I, uh- I worked construction
to pay for college.
Big <i>Leave It To Beaver</i> houses.
- We had two kinds of housewives.
- [Sighs]
Fiddlers-
always changed their tune.
Made you replace cabinets
after they were already in.
And the doers.
Well, the doers, uh-
They always made the call.
Once.
I always get what I want.
[Chuckling]
<i>[Jarod Narrating] I've heard that love</i>
<i>makes the world go round.</i>
<i>Or is it money?</i>
<i>It is in Argyle's world.</i>
<i>I'd gotten his $5,000</i>
<i>courtesy of Centre funds.</i>
<i>But before we went to pay off</i>
<i>his loan shark, Mr. Faddis...</i>
<i>Argyle insisted on making a stop.</i>
<i>But as is so Argyle,</i>
<i>around every corner is another surprise.</i>
<i>Although his Pretender skills</i>
<i>needed honing, Argyle was right.</i>
<i>In a way,</i>
<i>we were kindred spirits.</i>
- <i>There was just something about Argyle l-</i>
- <i>[Dog Barking]</i>
<i>[Clicks Tongue]</i>
<i>Understood.</i>
Dog. I gotta make sure
he diddles on the balcony.
<i>Make yourself at home.</i>
<i>Oh, no! For the love of Pete.</i>
<i>I told you the balcony.</i>
<i>[Dog Barks]</i>
- [Crowd Cheering]

<i>[TVContinues]</i>
Freeze, soldier!
I've tangled with S.S. Twice your size.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- If you think you can just waltz in here...
and swipe my prize possessions
for a vial of mind-altering crap...
- you got another think comin'.
- Argyle!
- Make your peace, son.
- <i>Yo, yo, yo! Yo, hold up.</i>
Take it easy. This is my friend.
This man is my friend.
Oh. Wait a minute.
What the heck are you doin' here?
What, I can't come here?
All of a sudden, I can't come here?
- My buildings are done.
- Oh, yeah? Well, your manners ain't.
Name's Benny, retired field medic.
101 st Airborne- Screaming Eagles-
W.W. II.
My name is Jarod.
Firm handshake- sign of character.
In some cultures,
it means you're a skilled horseman.
I was a rodeo clown once.
Which would explain
why you work with my son.
Um, yo, Pop. That's, uh-
Jarod, like myself...
has broadened his horizons
in the ever-expanding...
and creatively exciting
world of computer-aided drafting.
- Actually, I was just-
- <i>[Bell Dings, Tune]</i>
- No.
<i>Medicine time, Pop.</i>
- The sacred timepiece has spoken.
- <i>[Ends]</i>
<i>Cherish your health, Jarod.
It's the only thing you got that's truly yours...
besides earwax and nose hair.
"Demoxidyle." "Recrotin."
Do you have
an enzyme imbalance?
Brain condition.
Also gave me this limp.
- It could be enzyme-related, but it doesn't-
- Could be.
Been a pleasure, "Jerry."
Pope's comin' back on.
Uh, isn't he on tape?
You don't pause the pontiff.
You borrowed the $5,000
for him, didn't you?
Well, V.F.W. Gives him insurance...
but it don't cover
what he really needs.
<i>We lost Ma about a year ago.</i>
<i>He's been goin'downhill ever since.</i>
They saw the pope together
back in '95. Giants Stadium.
That was right after Ma got sick.
Doc said she had, like,
a month to live.
<i>My old man swears the pope gave her</i>
<i>those three extra years.</i>
He just wants to go to Vatican City,
you know?
See the guy, hear the mass,
maybe thank him.
- I don't know.
- $5,000 covers a trip to Italy.
Yeah. I know.
[Clears Throat]
- But, um-
- But what?
Well, uh, there's this guy
who works for Faddis.
He, uh- He handles
my high-yield investments.
So you borrowed $5,000
from a loan shark...
and then you lost it to a bookie.
Jarod, I just want my dad's trip
to be top drawer, you know?
First pew all the way.
Is that too much to ask?
<i>[Narrating]</i>
<i>Argyle's heart was in the right place...</i>
<i>[Narrating]</i>
<i>Argyle's heart was in the right place...</i>
<i>but, as usual, his brain wasn't.</i>
<i>I insisted we go straight</i>
<i>to pay off Faddis.</i>
[Chortling] I can't wait to see Faddis's face
when I slide him the green.
<i>He insisted on going it alone.</i>
Be careful.
<i>A little quick homework told me</i>
<i>that Argyle's loan shark was a man-eater...</i>
<i>a short-tempered, violent killer-</i>
<i>Sonny Faddis.</i>
<i>Along with Sonny's Clam Shack,</i>
<i>he owned a big piece of the waterfront...</i>
<i>and supplied seafood</i>
<i>to most of Atlantic City.</i>
[Barking]
<i>It didn't take long to see</i>
<i>that Argyle was in over his head.</i>
- <i>And his back against the wall.</i>
- [Bone Cracks]
- [Screaming]
- [Tires Squealing]
- <i>Get in! Get in!</i>
- <i>[Dog Barks]</i>
You <i>mamalukes!</i>
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Who were they?
Those guys?
Faddis's boys.
- The Africans.
- Africans?
- South Africans.
- Look, Argyle...
they would never have broken
another finger if you were paid up.
Well?
Okay, okay.
I owe 'em a favor.
Once I'm done with that,
I'm free and clear.
[Sighs] Don't say it.
Don't even think it.
The guy'll fly solo
on this one, man.
No worries, man.
Thanks for everything you done.
And that five grand- back in your
bank account before you even know it.
Just give me a little time.
That's all. A little time.
You know, he may be
man's best friend...
but you, J-dog,
you are my best friend.
[Whimpers]
[Exhales]
Argyle, here.
Two first-class tickets
to Vatican City.
Make sure your dad
sees the pope.
I can't, man. It's gotta be from me.
You've already done enough.
<i>Sayonara,</i> man. Adios.
Take care of yourself.
- <i>[Engine Starts]</i>
- [No Audible Dialogue]
<i>[Narrating]</i>
<i>Second thoughts can be dangerous.</i>
<i>But it quickly dawned on me</i>
<i>that leaving Argyle and Dog would be like-</i>
<i>Well, it would be like leaving</i>
<i>two wounded animals in a trap.</i>
<i>Itjust wasn't in me.</i>
<i>You guys coming or what?</i>
- You were praying for your father, weren't you?
- Yeah.
He gave it to me.
It's laminated.
He and Mom got it
when they saw him in '95.
I was prayin' that, you know, he'd get to see
the popester before it was too late.
Too late?
Well, yeah, Jarod.
He's-He's dyin'.
<i>Argyle's situation</i>
<i>put into focus for me...</i>
<i>something I think I've known</i>
<i>for a long time-</i>
<i>that until I find my family...</i>
<i>helping people</i>
<i>like Benny and Argyle...</i>
<i>is the next best thing.</i>
<i>[Jarod Narrating] On my end,</i>
<i>things were going... pretty smoothly.</i>
<i>But how was I to know that the middle part</i>
<i>of this story would get so messy?</i>
<i>Faddis had a simplejob</i>
<i>for Argyle-</i>
<i>pick up a bag of skimmed casino money</i>
<i>from a Dumpster.</i>
- <i>But something about this was nagging me.</i>
- <i>[Dog Yips]</i>
<i>Why would Faddis trust Argyle</i>
<i>to pick up his money?</i>
<i>After all, Argyle's a guy</i>
<i>who named his dog...</i>
<i>well, Dog.</i>
<i>No worries.</i>
<i>Just like Argyle said.</i>
<i>For a second, I believed him.</i>
[Groans]
- <i>A split second.</i>
- Uh! That hurt.
<i>Turns out the bag-and the money inside-</i>
<i>didn't belong to Faddis.</i>
<i>It belonged to this guy</i>
<i>who called himself the Cuban...</i>
<i>and called me something else.</i>
[Irish Accent]
LittleJoe from Chicago.
What makes you think
you can come to my town...
<i>kill two of my couriers</i>
<i>and steal my money?</i>
This cash belongs to the Cuban.
- The Cuban?
- Cuban?
- You never heard of the Cuban?
- Not one that sounds like you.
I'm not <i>a Cuban.
I'm <i>the</i> Cuban.
<i>Remember those second thoughts?</i>
And this is my little friend.
[Barking, Growling]
<i>[Argyle]</i>
<i>Oh, yeah! Yeah!</i>
- Whoa.
- [Barking]
- [Loud Grunt]
<i>You're a good boy. You're a good boy.</i>
<i>You're a good boy.</i>
- Get outta here!
- Yeah.
- <i>[Argyle] Aw, shoot! The money!</i>
- Forget the money.
- <i>Argyle!</i>
- Oh, geez!
- <i>[Gunshots]</i>
- [Grunts] Drive! Drive! Drive!
[Thunder Continues]
<i>He's still out.</i>
<i>God bless Dramamine.</i>
<i>Tell me, Parker. This Thomas-</i>
<i>Does he know where you work?</i>
<i>[Thomas]</i>
<i>This really hits the spot.</i>
Mmm. Thanks for the eats.
It's comin' out of your paycheck.
[Laughing]
Shrimp.
- I got you hooked, didn't I?
- I've always been partial to Mu Shu.
You mean that's all you ever order.
<i>Someone once told me</i>
<i>stability breeds success.</i>
That's because they never had
sweet-and-pungent shrimp.
Oh.
Uh-oh. Last piece.
- [Clicks Tongue]
- [Laughing]
Are you always
this demanding at work?
I'm a doer, remember?
Ah, that's right.
<i>Corporate risk assessment.
Sounds like a fancy name
for insurance.
Fancy name for stress.
I, um, mm-
I solve problems for my company.
<i>I was gonna tell you-</i>
[Clears Throat]
I, uh- I, uh...
went up on the roof
to check for the leak.
You know, water damage.
And, uh-
Well, there may be
another room back there.
Let's just cover it up
like-like we talked about.
Look, my company
makes me carry that.
[Murmurs]
Hey, work is work.
<i>Anyway, I should be done</i>
<i>by Saturday...</i>
if you don't slow me down
with more food.
<i>It's a part of me</i>
<i>I wish he hadn't seen.</i>
The gun is something
you carry, Parker.
It's not who you are.
- <i>[Jarod] Are you all right?</i>
- Oh, J-man, I'm cold.
- I'm so cold.
- What are you talking about?
This is just a flesh wound.
The bullet barely nicked you.
- [Whimpers]
- Yeah?
I know what you're gonna say,
but how was I supposed to know...
that an Irish Cuban was gonna show up
and spout wiggy.
<i>He called you LittleJoe.</i>
<i>What's that all about?</i>
He was obviously expecting
this LittleJoe.
<i>Yeah, but too bad for him</i>
<i>we're the ones bringing home the green.</i>
Goodyear blimp says Argyle's a pimp.
Oh, no, J-man.
Oh, no, J-man.
<i>[Narrating]</i>
<i>I could see it in Argyle's eyes.</i>
<i>Before today,</i>
<i>I would've called it greed.</i>
- Oh, no.
- <i>But this was fear.</i>
<i>No money in the bag</i>
<i>meant no trip to Italy...</i>
<i>and no dying wish for the one thing</i>
<i>that really matters to Argyle- Pop.</i>
Step back, son. Thanks to me,
no man in the 101 st ever lost a limb.
Except Bernie Sankowitz- He lost his big toe,
but that's barely an appendage.
Lamina-pope let me down.
Hey, what's this doin' in here?
- That's not my key.
- That's an awful lot of sedative.
[Barking]
Hey, Pop, how about
we skip the needle?
- Take it like a man, soldier.
- [Gasps]
- [Screaming]
- [Whimpering]
[Scream Echoing]
<i>[Narrating]</i>
<i>I wasn't having any luck with the key...</i>
<i>but I did track down the Cuban-</i>
<i>A.K.A. Denis O'Quinn.</i>
<i>Turns out he was the second-biggest</i>
<i>loan shark in Atlantic City...</i>
<i>second only to the clam king,</i>
<i>Sonny Faddis.</i>
<i>But what was the Cuban doing</i>
<i>at the Dumpster? Stealing from Faddis?</i>
<i>No. That didn't make any sense.</i>
<i>None of this does.</i>
<i>It felt like Faddis had set Argyle up.</i>
<i>But for what?</i>
<i>The key had definitely</i>
<i>been planted on him.</i>
- <i>And probably by the Africans.</i>
- Orlani.
Faddis's minions must have planted it
on Argyle when they broke his finger.
<i>Yeah. He's out colder</i>
<i>than spit on ice.</i>
- You were right- too much knockout juice.
- He'll be fine.
Not if he keeps up like this. A son
should never stop listening to his father.
He should know to stay away
from the wrong people.
My Adella would have
made sure of that.
- She had a beautiful smile.
- <i>Oh, yeah, didn't she?</i>
And such a way with that kid.
- He was an only chid.
- Yep.
After he was born, <i>Dr.</i> Canepa told Adella
she had to close down the baby foundry.
[Chuckles] My buttercup
always found the silver lining.
- She said Argyle broke the mold.
- Many molds.
If she was here, he wouldn't be
sneaking around with a bunch of criminals...
pretending to be an architect.
You knew about that.
That kid wouldn't know a straightedge
if it bit him on the tokus.
[Chuckles]
<i>I know he's not perfect, Jarod,</i>
<i>but he's got a kind soul.</i>
He's got her soul.
You underestimate fathers.
I may have fought in the big one...
but she was the real hero.
When I lost her...
it was like bein' at the front...
and losin' contact with H.Q.
I just didn't know
what was what anymore.
And I can't reach him.
God knows I'd love to find a way.
Orlani?
I couldn't find a bank or a key maker
with that name.
I got a buddy in the V.F.W.
He's a locksmith.
I'll have him take a gander.
- Where you goin'?
- <i>Trolling.</i>
For shark.
<i>[Narrating]</i>
<i>Loan shark, that is.</i>
<i>Something told me that I was caught</i>
<i>in the middle of a turfwar.</i>
<i>So I put on</i>
<i>my best wiseguy duds...</i>
<i>and paid a visit to the clam king.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Mr. Faddis, Call me the pope.</i>
The pope, huh? Well, I don't serve
loaves and fishes here.
- <i>Andres, get me a fresh plate after</i>
<i>I deal with this clown.</i>
- <i>[Man] It needs more garlic.</i>
<i>[Woman Chattering]</i>
So, uh, what can I do for you,
Mr. Pope?
Why would you loan $5,000...
- to a guy like Argyle?
- Oh, you know that little weasel?
If he's such a weasel, why did you ask him
to make a pickup for you?
- Who said I did?
- He did.
Now you listen to me.
I don't care what you call yourself.
I'm gonna spell it out for you
like you were five.
<i>Argyle still owes me a big favor.</i>
You're gonna tell me where
that little insect is...
or you're gonna go
for a long walk off a short pier.
<i>Cliché, I know.
But I happen to own the pier.
I'll deliver you Argyle...
for a price.
- Ten.
- Come on. You got more clams than that.
Twenty.
- All right.
- Al! Where are my cigars?
- Sorry, Mr. Faddis. I just got back from Orlani.
- Thank you.
- Orlani.
- I eat there every Friday.
I keep a humidor in the back.
You like that place?
What's not to like?
- You oughta try the osso buco. It's phenomenal.
- I don't care much for veal.
It reminds me of my childhood.
<i>[Narrating]</i>
<i>My meeting with Faddis answered one question.</i>
<i>Orlani was a restaurant,</i>
<i>another restaurant.</i>
<i>I had a feeling that the key-</i>
<i>no pun- to this mystery...</i>
<i>was locked inside a humidor there.</i>
<i>All I had to do was</i>
<i>get that key back from Benny...</i>
<i>but he had a plan ofhis own.</i>
<i>Benny knew about Orlani all along.</i>
<i>And to make matters worse,</i>
<i>the Screaming Eagle...</i>
<i>decided to take matters</i>
<i>into his own hands...</i>
<i>drop behind enemy lines</i>
<i>and strike a blow for his son.</i>
<i>I wish I could say that the war was about</i>
<i>to end, but it was just beginning.</i>
<i>War is hell, especially when</i>
<i>a slippery lock pick is suddenly the enemy.</i>
[Muffled Yell]
<i>Welcome to my Waterloo.</i>
I'm warning you!
I've tangled with S.S.
Twice your size!
<i>[Jarod Narrating] Benny took matters</i>
<i>into his own hands all right.</i>
- <i>And the Africans were about to take a finger.</i>
- Oh, no.
- Geez.
- I wouldn't do that.
<i>I was unarmed,</i>
<i>but Sydney always taught me...</i>
<i>that my brain</i>
<i>is my most powerful weapon.</i>
- [Grunts]
- <i>Benny, don't! Hey.</i>
Let's get outta here.
Old Rommel ain't got nothin' on you.
[Chuckles]
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>The flight from hell.</i>
<i>The pilot says we'll be circling</i>
<i>for another half an hour.</i>
Think you'll make it in time
to see Thomas?
It probably doesn't matter,
not after the last time.
- <i>Thomas?</i>
- <i>In here.</i>
<i>I was right.</i>
<i>There is a room behind this wall.</i>
And...
<i>Iook what I found.</i>
It was a studio or something.
The skylights back there are great.
As soon as I lose this wall,
it'll really brighten up in here.
Leave-Leave it up.
- Are you kidding me?
- Leave it up.
I have to catch a flight
to Hawaii in an hour. Just-
<i>Cover it.
You knew about the room.
I saw your mother's name
on some stationery.
<i>Catherine Parker.
It was her studio.
- You knew it was there all along.
- Yes, I did.
I'm the one who put the wall up,
so just leave it up.
Parker, why didn't
you say something?
What am I supposed to say?
[Exhales]
You want me to tell you that
that was her favorite room...
<i>and that's where she would read to me</i>
<i>and tell me stories and braid my hair?</i>
Is that what I'm supposed to do-
just bare my soul to a stranger?
Oh.
So, I'm a stranger.
I figured at least, uh,
acquaintance.
[Hushed]
Well, you figured wrong.
- That what the gun's for, hmm?
- [Exhales]
To keep strangers away?
I'm guessing your life's filled with them-
starting with her.
Put the wall back up
while I'm gone.
Sure thing.
I'll be back Saturday...
to give you the check.
[Exhales]
[Exhales]
<i>I let him go.</i>
He stood there waiting...
for me to stop him...
and I let him go.
Your fix-it man is right, Parker.
Why is everyone a stranger?
<i>Aw, nuts!</i>
<i>We're up to our necks in it now, Pop.</i>
Look, Faddis, that fungus,
has been in the rackets...
since before you two were born.
Understand something, Benny.
Faddis is a killer, and he won't stop
until he finds both of you.
And who's a fungus now, Pop?
You lied toJarod about the key.
You want him to fight
your battles for you? Is that it?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Nobody fights my battles for me.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah, and not everybody was so lucky
they got to go to World War II.
- <i>I was serving my country-</i>
- Okay. Okay. Enough!
<i>Look, your father</i>
<i>only lied about the key...</i>
because he was trying
to get Faddis off your back.
- You were?
- [Murmurs]
Your son borrowed the money
from Faddis...
so he could surprise you
with a trip to the Vatican.
You mean... see the big guy?
Yeah, Pop. If you just stick
with me and Jarod, you know?
We wanna get you there
so you can see the guy, you know?
Be-Before you die and all.
<i>Isn't there something</i>
<i>you wanna tell Argyle?</i>
[Clicks Tongue, Murmurs]
- <i>Benny.</i>
- Hmm?
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>a brain condition, do you?</i>
And this medication-
[Crunching]
Mmm. Sugar pills.
You mean,
y-you're not dyin', Pop?
I've got a great idea here.
Why don't we try a little fact...
instead of fiction, huh?
<i>[Narrating] It was the first time</i>
<i>both of them had shut up...</i>
<i>since I'd gotten there,</i>
<i>and I knew where the silence came from.</i>
<i>There was a time when it would have</i>
<i>been filled with another voice.</i>
She's gone.
She can't be replaced.
<i>That's not an option with mothers.</i>
But, you two, you don't
have to lose each other.
Hmm.
<i>It was the kind of moment</i>
<i>I left the Centre for.</i>
<i>Of course, helping</i>
<i>Argyle's father meant nothing...</i>
<i>if Argyle didn't</i>
<i>live through the week.</i>
<i>That's where the cigar box came in.</i>
[Whimpers]
<i>Argyle thought he had</i>
<i>everything figured out.</i>
Hey, hey. Yo, I got
this thing nailed, J-man.
See, I'm thinkin'
this guy's the Cuban, right?
So he's gotta have
family on the island...
under the yoke of the evil dictator
Fidel Castro and whatnot.
<i>But, of course, Argyle was way off.</i>
<i>Faddis had killed two of the Cuban's</i>
<i>couriers and stolen his money...</i>
<i>and he needed someone</i>
<i>to blame it on-Argyle.</i>
<i>The contents of the cigar box</i>
<i>fingered Argyle as a criminal nicknamed-</i>
LittleJoe from Chicago.
<i>You see, the Cuban was supposed</i>
<i>to find Argyle at the Dumpster and kill him.</i>
<i>He'd find the key, the cigar box</i>
<i>and have his culprit.</i>
- <i>And Faddis would get away with murder...</i>
- [Rattling On, Indistinct]
- <i>and a lot of the Cuban's money.</i>
...first flight straight to Havana.
And bam, bam, bam!
They are livin' high off the hog...
like capitalist pigs in Atlantic City.
Hmm? Hmm? Am I good?
You nailed it, Argyle.
<i>Just one question-</i>
<i>Where were the Cuban's couriers?</i>
You're gonna go
for a long walk off a short pier.
<i>Cliché, I know,</i>
<i>but I happen to own the pier.</i>
<i>Faddis had covered the Cuban's couriers</i>
<i>in chains and tossed them.</i>
<i>It was a cliché- the worst kind.</i>
<i>I was planning</i>
<i>a similar fate for Faddis.</i>
<i>It kind ofbecame my M.O.</i>
<i>Since I escaped the Centre-</i>
<i>payback against the people who think</i>
<i>they can step on the little guy.</i>
<i>In this case, one of</i>
<i>the littlest guys on the planet.</i>
<i>What are you doing</i>
<i>with my case?</i>
Oh. No, this ain't
what it looks like.
- This ain't what it looks like.
- What are you doin' with this?
<i>I wasn't stealin'anything.</i>
I was borrowing that...
to make this.
Lamina-pope gave me the idea.
This way, she'll always be protected
from the elements...
<i>and always close.</i>
<i>Nicest thing</i>
<i>anybody ever did for me.</i>
<i>My pretend started out</i>
<i>pretending to be Argyle's friend.</i>
<i>I wasn't pretending anymore.</i>
<i>I told Argyle to meet me</i>
<i>at the pier at 8.00.</i>
<i>But unfortunately, he was followed there</i>
<i>by the Africans.</i>
<i>Coast is clear, big guy.
We're good to go.
<i>But Faddis's goon</i>
<i>had other ideas.</i>
<i>Make that</i> goons, <i>plural.</i>
- [Grunts]
- Oh! Aw, no! Aw, no!
<i>Aw! No!</i>
<i>Aw! No!</i>
<i>Unlike his brain,</i>
<i>Argyle's feet were working just fine.</i>
I'm sorry, J-man!
<i>As for the goons, well, I think you know</i>
<i>what they had in mind for me.</i>
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Good luck, Parker, and don't worry.</i>
<i>Things with Thomas</i>
<i>will work out for the best.</i>
- Miss Parker-
- Not now, Broots. I'm in a hurry.
Oh, for what it's worth,
I say go for it.
You were listening.
Well, I heard parts.
Oh, what, is everybody a spy?
[Chuckles]
Who do we work for?
I'm just saying that
if I felt that way about somebody...
I'd tell 'em.
It's like this plane ride
we just took.
At any second,
we could've been a statistic.
We shouldn't ever
pass up an opportunity.
Thanks for the tip.
<i>[Jarod Narrating]</i>
<i>Which brings us to the end.</i>
<i>And with any luck, not my own.</i>
Wake up, wiseass.
I wouldn't want you to sleep through this.
You're going in for a dip.
[Screaming]
No!
<i>Faddis had sunk another victim...</i>
<i>but that's exactly</i>
<i>how I'd planned it-</i>
- <i>from the Africans following Argyle...</i>
- [Beeping]
<i>To the camera we had set up</i>
<i>to capture the whole thing.</i>
<i>Losing the lock pick, however,</i>
<i>wasn't part of the plan.</i>
<i>Thank goodness</i>
<i>for my four-legged backup.</i>
Wait up. Wait up.
Wait for me.
Where'd you go?
Give me that.
- What are you lookin' at?
- [Whimpers]
<i>Faddis had invited the Cuban to celebrate</i>
<i>my long walk off a short pier.</i>
<i>They were heading to Orlani</i>
<i>for some osso buco.</i>
<i>But like I said,</i>
<i>I don't go for veal.</i>
Everybody freeze.
Nobody makes a move.
<i>The Cuban wasn't too happy</i>
<i>when I told him what Faddis had done.</i>
<i>Neither were the police.</i>
<i>I told them where they could find Faddis,</i>
<i>the Cuban's dead couriers...</i>
<i>and our videotape.</i>
Nobody messes with the 'Gyle
and his sidekick, J-rod!
- [Dog Barks]
- Didn't anybody ever tell you crime don't pay?
We're a pretty good team,
you and me.
- Thomas?
- <i>[Keys Clatter]</i>
<i>You always this punctual?</i>
The storm.
[Sighs]
We had to circle and-
<i>I know you didn't ask for a door.</i>
If you want, I can put
the wall back up.
So, what's the damage?
Same price. Nothing extra.
It's locked now,
but if you want to open it...
you got the option.
Tommy.
I shouldn't have lied.
It's just-
I was... very young
when my mother died.
And after it happened, I just-
My- l-
I just couldn't bring myself
to go into that room.
[Sighs]
Mom and I used to-
used to...
talk all night in there.
And moonlight made it so special.
She had a very... painful life...
and that room was her sanctuary.
No, Parker.
You were.
But you can't remember that.
When you closed off that room,
you closed off a part of your soul-
the part that came from her.
Get it back.
I can't do it alone.
<i>Come on. It'll be okay.
<i>[Key Turns In Lock]</i>
<i>[Woman Vocalizing, Ethereal]</i>
[Chattering]
Your Holiness,
this is truly a great honor.
I only wish my Adella was here.
But I guess she's watching
from up above. Huh?
Nobody knows that
better than you, hey, big guy?
You know, he's so, like, human.
- I know. He ain't no lamina-pope.
- It's amazing.
[Speaking Italian]
Argyle will never forget this, baby.
Your Highness, talk to me
about the gift shop.
What's up with those people down there?
They don't have any manners?
<i>They work for you?</i>
<i>Think you could kick us in a discount?</i>
<i>You ever think about getting</i>
<i>those prayer cards laminated?</i>
<i>Hmm? Hmm? What you think?</i>
<i>[Cell Phone Beeping]</i>
- [Rings, Beeps]
- This is Sydney.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>It's incredible how beautiful Yellowstone is.</i>
- Even from 12,000 feet.
- I can barely hear you.
I'm going through
a little turbulence.
- Speaking of black clouds, is Miss Parker around?
- Hasn't arrived yet.
- Well, it's very important that I speak with her.
- Sounds mysterious.
I'm on my way to meet someone
that was very close to her mother.
- Someone who can answer a lot of questions.
- [Engine Pops, Sputters]
Jarod, is something wrong?
<i>I'm fine, but my engine</i>
<i>doesn't appear to be.</i>
Listen, Sydney.
I don't have much time.
- Did the package come that I sent for Miss Parker?
- It arrived early this morning.
- See that she gets it.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
- If you don't talk to me in one hour-
- [Engine Sputters]
- [Beeps]
- [Whispers] Jarod.
[Beeps]
<i>Come on, baby.</i>
<i>Don't fail on me now.</i>
[Sputtering]
- <i>[Applause On TV]</i>
- Make with the hot stuff, stranger boy.
<i>[Broots Laughing]</i>
Hmm.
[Laughs]
<i>[Broots Laughing]</i>
- Home movies, Broots?
- [Clears Throat] Miss Parker.
- [Chuckles] Good morning.
- What's good about it, Cheetah?
Well, uh-
Are you okay?
Just peachy.
Thomas is out of town
for another week.
Last time I checked,
my father was still in Cabo with that troll.
And if that's not enough torment,
he left Raines in charge of this nuthouse.
<i>Speaking of which,</i>
<i>just what the hell are you two doing?</i>
Oh, uh- [Chuckles]
It's therapy.
<i>Sydney's hoping that</i>
<i>a little cognitive stimulation...</i>
<i>might improve Angelo's</i>
<i>expressive abilities.</i>
Well, it certainly seems
to be working for the monkeys.
Oh, Miss Parker.
- You wanted to see me, Dr. Dolittle?
- You okay?
I'm fine. Geez. You get a little gas,
and people think you're dying.
Seems like you've had
a great deal of indigestion lately.
Well, what do you expect?
I work with you three.
<i>[Man On TV]</i>
<i>Right then and there.</i>
And it sure made
a happy gal out of Fanny...
and made a big hero out of
the Lonesome Stranger.
Hi-ho, Plastic.
[Whinnies]
Oh, for God's sake.
What do you want, Sydney?
It's from Jarod to you.
Probably another
twisted attempt to...
rub my face in my twisted
dysfunctional family life.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>A rosary?</i>
Miss Parker has pain.
- Parker, are you okay?
- Sydney.
Hang on.
Oh, God.
Miss Parker!
Miss Parker!
Parker.
Parker, can you hear me?
Syd, she was just standing there,
and then- and then she just fell.
- Oh, my God. She's burning up.
- <i>She's going into shock.</i>
- We've got to get her to a hospital now.
- Okay.
<i>Help! We need help.</i>
<i>Somebody call 911.</i>
Miss Parker needs faith...
but faith is dead.
<i>Miss Parker needs faith,</i>
<i>but faith is dead.</i>
<i>Mayday! Mayday! This is</i>
<i>2- niner Charlie Victor. Over.</i>
- [Man] What's your problem, Charlie Victor?
- <i>I've lost all power.</i>
- And I'm descending rapidly.
- <i>Charlie Victor, what's your location? Over.</i>
<i>Charlie Victor,
do you read me? Over.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
[Grunting]
<i>[Woman's Voice] B.P. 's 70 over 40</i>
<i>and falling. Pulse 110 and thready.</i>
Pupils dilated
and unresponsive.
O saturation, 78.
Respiration shallow at 40.
She needs plasma, O-neg-
lots of it.
I want a <i>C.B.C.,</i> blood gases, the works.
You're a doctor, right?
- Psychiatrist.
- What the hell happened?
[Sighs] She was experiencing abdominal
pain. Then she just collapsed.
She has a history of ulcers.
And she's been under a lot of stress.
She appears to have massive internal bleeding.
Probably a perforated ulcer.
- Well, will she be okay?
- It's too early to tell.
Excuse me. Alert O.R.
To prepare for surgery.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Broots, I've got to get back to the Centre.</i>
- You're leaving now, Syd?
- Jarod's supposed to call.
- Jarod?
- I'll explain later.
Stay here
and monitor her condition.
I'll be back.
Okay.
I'm not goin' anywhere.
<i>[Man] "Yea, though I walk through</i>
<i>the valley of the shadow of death...</i>
<i>I will fear no evil,</i>
<i>for thou art with me. "
<i>[Speaking Spanish]</i>
<i>Amen.</i>
<i>The valley of</i>
<i>the shadow of death.</i>
<i>The shadow of death. The shadow of death.</i>
<i>[Echoes]</i>
Jarod, can you keep
a secret?
I guess so, Miss Parker.
What is it?
There's a dead body
in the Centre.
A dead body?
Where is it?
I saw them deliver the coffin
this morning to Dr. Raines.
He told them to take it
to the containment area.
Yeah. I've heard Sydney
talk about that place.
<i>They do a lot of special projects down there,</i>
<i>but they've never taken me there.</i>
- I don't even know where it is.
- Me either.
I asked my daddy about the coffin
and the body, but...
he wouldn't talk about it.
For the last few weeks-
well, since Mommy died-
<i>he's been too busy to talk to me</i>
<i>about anything.</i>
I still can't believe
she's really gone.
I'm sorry about your mother.
I'm okay.
Anyway, if Dad won't tell me where the body is,
then I'll just find it on my own.
If you could follow Dr. Raines without him
knowing it, he'd lead you straight to it.
- Well, come on then. Let's go find him.
- I didn't say I would do it.
- You're not scared, are you?
- No.
<i>It's just...</i>
I've never seen anyone
who was dead before.
They can't hurt you- anymore.
<i>I'm more afraid of Dr. Raines.</i>
<i>I hate doctors.</i>
She's lost a lot of blood.
The pressure's almost undetectable.
- We don't have much time.
- <i>[Woman] She's prepped for abdominal entry.</i>
- Are you ready?
- She's out. Let's start.
- <i>This one's gonna need a miracle to survive.</i>
- <i>[Machine Beeping]</i>
[Groaning]
[Groaning]
Ow.
[Grunts]
- [Crack]
- [Screams]
[Panting]
[Grunting]
[Groaning, Coughs]
<i>[Young Jarod's Voice]</i>
<i>I wonder what it's like to die.</i>
Ask Raines. Looks like he died
a long time ago.
<i>Come on.
Let's go find the dead guy.
It's weird. Death is something
that everyone experiences...
<i>but no one wants</i>
<i>to talk about it.</i>
Yeah. When my mom died...
all the grown-ups would
come up and talk to me...
about anything except what
I wanted to talk about.
About what happened to her.
He went this way.
So when we find the coffin,
then what?
We open it.
I wonder what
it'll look like.
What if it was someone
who was mutilated in a wreck or-
or killed in a sim?
Or maybe it was someone the Centre
wanted to get rid of.
Maybe Dr. Raines created some kind of
monster, like Frankenstein.
- Who's Frankenstein?
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
<i>He's coming back.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>
- There's nowhere to hide. What do we do?
- I don't know.
- <i>[Doorknob Rattles]</i>
- Who's in there?
- [Young Miss Parker] Thanks, Angelo.
- Faith is waiting.
That was too close.
Don't wet your pants, Jarod. You look like
you're gonna pass out or something.
<i>[Soft Growl, Panting]</i>
<i>[Growls]</i>
Perfect.
- Get out of here!
- <i>[Rock Rattles]</i>
Hello.
<i>Can anybody read me?
This is an emergency. Hello. Over.
This is Montana Air Patrol.
Please respond.
This is 2-niner Charlie Victor.
My engine stalled,
and I've crashed...
into a- a river
or an inlet.
- I need some help.
- Are you hurt? Over.
I have multiple lacerations.
I dislocated my shoulder...
<i>and I think I've broken</i>
<i>a couple of ribs.</i>
- [Mouthing Words]
- <i>I'm stable for now, but I
<i>could use some medical help.</i>
Roger that. Are there
any other survivors? Over.
- <i>No. I'm alone.</i>
- [Static]
Hello. <i>Hello.</i> Can you hear me, air patrol?
Over. Hello.
- Hello.
- This is air patrol. I'm losing your signal.
There's a cold front coming in.
We need your exact location.
- Respond.
- <i>I'm not sure.</i>
I was about two hours
outside <i>of...</i> Casper.
<i>I was heading northwest.</i>
<i>I'm about 30 miles from-</i>
Thirty miles from where?
<i>Charlie Victor, I'm losing you.
Hello. Hello.
Please respond,
<i>Charlie Victor.
- I lost him.
- Probably for good.
Nobody can survive
a night out there. No one.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Hello. Can you hear me? Over.</i>
[Grunts] Can anybody hear me?
[Echoes]
Hello!
[Echoes]
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>
<i>[Echoes]</i>
<i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>
- Jarod?
- No, it's Broots.
- I'm here at the hospital. What's goin' on?
- Jarod never called.
- It's not like him. How's Miss Parker?
- I don't know.
They just brought her out of surgery.
They're getting her settled into <i>I.C.U.</i>
<i>I want to go in there, but they're not</i>
<i>letting anyone see her yet.</i>
<i>She shouldn't be</i>
<i>alone in there, Syd.</i>
Stay put, Broots.
I'm heading back there right away.
- Okay.
- [Beeps]
No one should be alone
at a time like this.
<i>[Wolf Howls]</i>
<i>[Owl Hoots]</i>
<i>Come on.
Damn it.
[Grunts]
<i>Come on.</i> Come on.
Please light.
<i>Come on.
Don't go out on me.
[Beeping]
[Beeping]
<i>[Chattering]</i>
<i>[Beeping Continues]</i>
<i>You look so cold.</i>
It's so strange, what with you
givin' me a hard time all the time.
But I know you don't mean it.
I know it's just your way.
<i>You've always</i>
<i>been there for me.</i>
<i>Whenever I needed someone,</i>
<i>it was you.</i>
<i>And you probably</i>
<i>can't even hear me.</i>
But I just
want you to know...
that, other than Debbie...
I feel closer to you...
than to anyone.
Miss Parker...
you know, you-
you can't leave me.
Miss Parker.
[Moans Softly]
- Don't be afraid.
- [Moans Softly]
- [Moans]
- Don't be afraid, Miss Parker.
- <i>[Young Jarod] Don't be afraid, Miss Parker.</i>
- <i>[Young Miss Parker] Afraid?</i>
<i>I'm not afraid. I just want to know</i>
<i>where the hell we're going.</i>
M-M-Miss Parker needs faith.
We don't need faith, Angelo.
We have to find the body.
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>Look.</i>
That must be it.
What is it?
It's where
they're keeping the body.
Faith.
[Young Jarod]
It feels strange to be here.
[Young Miss Parker]
Maybe we shouldn't be.
<i>[Young Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Come on. Let's get out ofhere.</i>
We've come this far.
What's wrong?
<i>[Young Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Nothing. It reminds me of m- Never mind.</i>
[Young Jarod]
But I thought you wanted to see it.
[Young Miss Parker]
I do. This just isn't the right time.
- Are you afraid?
- I don't know.
<i>Come on.
<i>[Wolf Whining]</i>
You hungry?
<i>Well, so am I. So, you'rejust gonna</i>
<i>have to wait a little longer for me.</i>
- [Shouts]
- [Growls]
No.
<i>[Machine Beeping]</i>
Sydney.
- <i>[Sydney] How is she?</i>
- <i>[Broots] Well, she lost a lot ofblood.</i>
Her fever's over 102.
The doctor says she's developed peritonitis,
whatever the hell that is.
It's bad.
They said she-
<i>that she might not make it.</i>
I wish there was
something I could do.
[Whispers]
You're already doing it, Broots.
<i>Sorry, guys.</i>
<i>Gotta ask you to leave now.</i>
- It's real important she gets her rest.
- Okay.
Faith.
[Moans]
Faith.
Shh. It's okay.
It's okay.
<i>[Miss Parker Moans Softly]</i>
<i>Faith.</i>
<i>[Woman On P.A.]</i>
<i>Wheelchair, 412.</i>
She keeps saying something
about faith.
That's what Angelo said-
in the sim lab when he saw
the rosary thatJarod sent her.
Right before she collapsed.
- What do you think it means?
- I'm not sure.
But I seem to remember
there was a project- long time ago-
which was code-named Faith.
- We need to get back to the Centre.
- Now?
I believeJarod was
in a plane crash.
- What?
- I need you to try and figure out
where he might have gone down.
- Nurse.
- Yes.
If her condition changes-
I have all your numbers.
I'll contact you immediately.
There isn't much
you can do here anyway.
- It's all up to her now.
- Thank you.
Faith.
I have to find...
faith.
It's-
It's a girl.
She's beautiful.
[Murmurs]
- You're not dead.
- Neither are you.
Yeah. It's just... we-
Never mind.
My name is Miss Parker.
Kind of formal, isn't it?
Hi. I'm Faith.
- Hi.
- I'm Jarod.
- And, uh, this is Angelo. He doesn't talk much.
- Hi.
- <i>[Young Jarod] What are you doin'down here?</i>
- Oh, I've been sick.
Really, really sick.
They brought me here
to get well.
I've never seen
other children in this place.
Yeah. They live here.
<i>I'm here with my dad.</i>
<i>He works here.</i>
But, as it turns out,
I'm usually alone.
I'm used to
being by myself too.
But I'm not alone now.
Maybe we could play together.
<i>You know, be friends.</i>
I'd like that.
- <i>[Footsteps Approaching]</i>
- Bad.
- We gotta get out of here.
- We're not supposed to be here.
We'll get in a lot of trouble.
- I won't tell anyone. I promise.
- Okay.
- We gotta go now. But we'll be back, okay?
- Okay.
- Come on.
- I'll be back. Bye.
I'm not going anywhere.
<i>Close.
You know, I've never
had a friend before.
I mean, a girlfriend.
I can't wait for Faith to get well
so we can play together.
Faith, uh, isn't just sick.
She's very sick.
What do you mean?
I read her chart, and she's-
she's not gonna make it.
But...
I don't want her to die.
I don't want anyone to die.
I don't want her to die.
[Echoes]
<i>I don't want anyone to die.</i>

You okay?
Yeah. I guess.
<i>Come on.
Is she... asleep?
[Whispers]
Faith. Faith.
Oh. Hi.
Did you see her?
Who?
My mommy.
She was right here.
There's no one here.
I must have been dreaming.
But it was so real.
We were laughing and talking about
what we were gonna do.
<i>And...</i>
I didn't feel...
you know, sick anymore.
How do you feel?
Better since you got here.
Here. It was my mom's.
It's mine now.
She said...
that I should hold it...
and think about her
whenever...
I feel frightened or sad.
You know, it's like...
I feel her with me again.
[Sobs]
And...
<i>before you know it...</i>
I'm not frightened
or lonely anymore.
It always
makes me feel better.
Thank you.
<i>And thank you</i>
<i>for being my friend.</i>
<i>I'll always be your friend.</i>
<i>I'll always be there for you</i>
<i>and watching over you.</i>
<i>Just like my mommy.</i>
Mommy.
Mommy.
<i>[Very Faint]</i>
<i>Mommy.</i>
She's gone.
<i>[Young Miss Parker]</i>
<i>No.</i>
No, Faith.
Oh, please, no, Faith.
- Please, Faith. Don't leave, Faith. No. Please.
- <i>[Alarm Ringing]</i>
- They'll be here <i>soon.</i> Come on.
- M-Must... g-go.
No. Faith.
<i>[Alarm Continues]</i>
<i>[Steady Beep]</i>
I told you I'd always
be watching you.
You've got to fight.
You can't give up.
It's not your time yet.
All clear.
You mommy loves you
very much.
And she wants you
to fight too.
<i>Up to 200.</i>
<i>One more time.</i>
<i>[Steady Beep]</i>
<i>[Faith] Your mommy loves you very much.</i>
<i>[Echoes]</i>
<i>[Young Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Mama, show me how to braid my hair.</i>
All right.
- [Beeps]
- We got her.
This one's a fighter.
Jarod, you can't give up.
I don't understand.
Just hang on.
They'll be coming for you soon.
Don't give up.
<i>[Giggling]</i>
Not yet.
<i>You can't... have me... yet.</i>
Just hang on.
It'll be daylight s-soon.
Hang on.
- Any news on Miss Parker?
- <i>Nothing.</i>
But her father
should be there by now.
He was flying back in as soon as
he heard what happened.
- And I found something.
- What?
Buried deep
in the Centre Archive.
- Faith.
- <i>Faith? Who is she?</i>
<i>Young girl who was here</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>
<i>But the record's incomplete. Somebody</i>
<i>went to a lot of trouble to hide the truth.</i>
- Any luck with Jarod?
- Oh, yeah. [Clears Throat]
Using a map of Yellowstone, flight charts
and satellite weather imaging...
from the last time
you spoke with Jarod...
I figure he went down
somewhere right in here.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>That would take days to search.</i>
Well, maybe not. I contacted
the Montana Air Patrol...
and they received a distress call
from someone in this area...
but lost it before they could
establish an exact location.
- Jarod?
- Well, it has to be.
- Using an emergency radio.
- Mm-hmm.
I correlated my data along with the location
of the air patrol's receiving station.
See, I figure he's got to be
right here along this three-mile bank of river.
<i>Contact the Montana</i>
<i>Air Patrol immediately.</i>
Okay.
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>I just hope we're not too late.</i>
<i>[Machine Beeping]</i>
Her vitals are stable.
- All we can do now is wait.
- Th-Thank you, Nurse.
Faith, where are you?
<i>Where are you?</i>
Faith, where are you?
<i>[Crying]</i>
Are you gonna be all right?
I think so.
Where did she go?
I don't know.
At least she didn't
die alone.
I wonder if we'll ever
see her again.
Have faith.
[Sobs]
She said she'd always
be watching over us.
I miss her...
and I don't even know
who she was.
<i>[Sobbing]</i>
<i>[Machine Beeping]</i>
[Exhales Deeply]
- Daddy.
- I'm so glad you're back.
- Daddy.
- Yes, angel.
Who's Faith?
Faith...
was your sister.
<i>[Young Mr. Parker]</i>
<i>What an awful way to die.</i>
<i>[Young Raines] Mr. Parker, the Cleaners</i>
<i>will be here soon to dispose of the body.</i>
<i>[Young Mr. Parker] God's sake, Raines.</i>
<i>Don't you have any compassion?</i>
Find the priest that did
<i>Catherine's funeral. Father Moore.
I want him to make
the arrangements.
[Young Raines]
Father Moore? I never trusted him.
We don't know what all
<i>Catherine may have told him over the years.
<i>[Mr. Parker]</i>
<i>I don't think you understand me.</i>
<i>Catherine's wishes
will be carried out.
The body is to go to Father Moore.
End of discussion!
[Young Mr. Parker]
Oh, Lord.
Nobody should ever die alone.
[Echoes]
- <i>[Wolf Growls]</i>
- [Gasps, Panting]

<i>[Growls]</i>
You can't have me yet.
[Grunts]
<i>[Helicopter Whirring]</i>
<i>[Jarod Grunts, Pants]</i>
<i>Over here!</i>
- He's alive.
- I'll be dammed.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Daddy, why didn't you tell me about Faith?</i>
I didn't tell you about Faith first because, uh,
I knew she was dying.
After your mother...
I couldn't tell you.
We'd both had enough.
She was my sister?
Her parents were killed.
She became a ward of the state.
Then she was diagnosed
with leukemia.
The doctor said there was, uh,
nothing could be done.
So the state, uh, put her
in a convalescent home...
to die.
How did she end up
at the Centre?
Well, your, uh-
your mother's priest, Father Moore,
told her about the girl.
They went to see her.
Your mother said that might have been
you in the nursing home.
She had to do something;
otherwise, she couldn't live with herself.
So the two of you
adopted her.
Ah. Well, with
Father Moore's help...
we brought her
to the Centre...
where Catherine
could be with her.
We doctored her with an experimental drug
the Centre was developing.
Future treatment proved successful
because of what we had learned from Faith.
She died
shortly after Catherine.
[Sobs]
Miss Parker.
<i>There's some people</i>
<i>who would like to see you.</i>
Miss Parker.
Hi.
- <i>Mr. Parker.</i>
- <i>[Sydney] The nurse called to let us know...</i>
<i>that you'd regained</i>
<i>consciousness.</i>
And I thought
you'd want this.
[Sobs, Giggles]
Thank you both.
Broots.
[Clears Throat]
Guess we'll see you later.
<i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>
- [Beeps]
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- [Beeps]
What? Jarod?
They found him.
Alive.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Jarod.</i>
It's nice to finally
meet you in the flesh.
I'm Father Moore.
But how did you find me?
Well, I was concerned
when you didn't arrive at Butte.
You seemed so anxious to meet
the last time we spoke.
Our mutual friend at the Centre told me
what happened and where I could find you.
- The Centre?
- No. No, no. Relax.
The Centre has no idea where you are
or where we're going.
Thank you-
for helping me.
<i>Catherine Parker would have
wanted it that way.
[Miss Parker]
I'd forgotten how beautiful it is.
- How did you get it?
- An old friend of your mother's.
- Father Moore.
- He found the rosary clutched in Faith's hand.
He knew how much
it meant to your mother...
so he wanted me
to give it to you.
Thank you, Jarod.
Do you ever
think about her?
I think about her
all the time.
- It's ironic too.
- What is?
All those years ago-
you and l-
we went searching for death...
and we found someone
who saved our lives.
I'm sure she was
in that room with me.
And I'm sure she was with me
up on that mountain.
She said she'd always
be watching over us.
She was.
- Are we crazy?
- I don't know exactly what happened.
- But I do know that I'm sure of one thing.
- What?
Love... transcends death.
That the people we love
touch our lives...
even after they're gone.
[Giggling]
<i>[Blues]</i>
Hope you got fire insurance.
- Excuse me?
- Dumpin' hot sauce on top of chili pepper gumbo?
You might as well
sit down on a blowtorch.
I like it hot.
- Mmm!
- Whoo!
Let me get you a glass of water.
Better yet...
why don't I reel in
the garden hose from out back?
[Cheering, Laughing]
It's been a pleasure
doin' business with you...
but I'm afraid
it's past my bedtime now.
So I'll be on my way.
I don't appreciate being hustled.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Now, "hustle"is such a distasteful word.</i>
Outplayed, yes.
Outsmarted, definitely.
But hustled? There's no gentlemen
sportsmen anymore.
You all call me again sometime, all right?
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Earl?</i>
- Billie.
- <i>Who let that murderer in here?</i>
<i>You know as well as I do,</i>
<i>there's no stopping Eddie Fontenot.</i>
Sometimes, it's better to see the devil
than to guess where he is.
- Whoo!
- He don't appreciate that.
He don't appreciate that.
This is for you, Marvin.
Give me that!
You don't wanna shoot that man.
<i>Girl, have you lost your mind?</i>
You don't point a gun at a man like Eddie
Fontenot unless you plan to pull the trigger.
I did.
Damn it, Earl!
Marvin was your brother.
<i>You owe him better than this.</i>
And you should mind
your own business.
I appreciate you helpin' out.
Name's Earl Dupree.
Jarod...
Pepper.
Would you mind if I asked
what happened to your brother?
Oh.
It happened two weeks ago.
<i>Marvin was the closet thing</i>
<i>to a father that Billie knew.</i>
<i>She worshipped the man.</i>
She was also the one
that found his body...
out in the alley behind the club.
That must have been tough for her.
[Chuckles]
Marvin was a good man.
Best pool player I ever saw.
He just hustled the wrong man.
The devil at the pool table.
His name is Eddie Fontenot.
Police could never prove
that he pulled the trigger. But-
You think he did.
Marvin was lookin' for a big score.
Enough money to send Billie
to a fancy drama school...
and get him off the road for good.
She was his life. He just wanted
to give her a different future.
So Eddie Fontenot...
invited Marvin over for a pool game.
A thousand dollars a rack.
- That's big money.
- <i>Had to be.</i>
The only black folks
Eddie Fontenot let in his house...
come in the back door
and carried a mop.
So what happened?
Marvin beat him
like a rented mule.
He was up 50 grand when I left to
come back here to close up the-the club.
If you think Fontenot killed your brother,
why do you allow him in your club?
The club is all I got.
<i>Eddie Fontenot could make</i>
<i>one phone call...</i>
and I'd wake up to a pile of cinders.
Don't you think it's time
that somebody stopped him?
There's only one way to get Eddie.
- How's that?
- You a pool player, Mr. Pepper?
I am now.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already</i>
<i>demonstrating more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
- <i>[Miss Parker] Daddy.</i>
- Huh?
Where have you been?
I've left messages for you all week.
Brigitte and I stole away to Aruba.
Real romantic.
Your mother will always be
the first love of my life.
She gave me you and your brother.
- Nobody can replace that.
- She'll try.
- A second family of Parkers.
- She can't have children.
How can you be sure about that?
I don't land in an airport
without knowing the conditions.
I had her medical records checked.
Sweetheart, at my age, I certainly don't
want a baby. Besides, I already got the best.
<i>Hmm?</i>
<i>Oh, which reminds me.</i>
- I need a favor.
- A favor?
We're planning a little family
get-together tomorrow night.
You know, dinner,
drinks, nothing fancy.
- It sounds nice.
- Yeah. The new floors...
won't be finished, so I thought
we could have it at your place.
Daddy, I'm not prepared to host.
It'll only be for family.
Ah, bring that gentleman friend of yours.
What's his name?
- Thomas?
- <i>Yeah.</i>
About time I got to know the fellow
that's wooing my little girl, don't you think?
- Daddy-
- <i>8.00 sharp.</i>
Oh, and easy on the dairy.
And I do love you so.
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
- Oh, God.
It's no fancy hotel,
but it's warm and it's clean.
Well, I appreciate the hospitality.
<i>[Earl] People didn't always</i>
<i>make it easy for those two.</i>
- <i>But through good times and bad,</i>
<i>Marvin loved that little girl.</i>
- <i>It shows.</i>
<i>[Woman Singing, Indistinct]</i>
That's her now.
Got a voice of serenity
and a heart of turmoil.
When you remember me
I hope it makes you smile
[Humming]
You sing like an angel.
You still here?
Mr. Pepper gonna be
stayin' with us for a while.
<i>You mind your manners now.</i>
What do you really want here, Mr. Pepper?
I don't <i>want</i> anything.
And my name is Jarod.
Earl said that Marvin
was like a father to you.
What happened to your real family?
My daddy died in a car accident
when I was a baby.
Mama got sick and passed
a few years later.
There was no other family. Marvin
was their best friend, so he adopted me.
It was lucky for you.
See this picture?
I'd just gotten the lead in <i>My Fair Lady</i>
at my high school...
which was a big deal 'cause
I was only a sophomore.
Marvin stands up in the club and
tells everybody how proud he is of me.
Uh, listen up, ladies and gentlemen.
My little Billie is gonna play
the lead in her high school play.
- <i>You should hear this girl sing.</i>
- <i>[Scattered Applause]</i>
She's got her mother's golden voice.
I'm so proud of you, Billie.
He always wanted me to become a singer,
just like my mother.
But that dream died in the alley,
right along with Marvin.
<i>A dream can only die</i>
<i>if the dreamer allows it to.</i>
<i>Billie, I'd like to help you find the truth</i>
<i>behind Marvin's killing.</i>
How do you plan to do that?
If I can hustle my way into
Eddie Fontenot's world like Marvin did...
maybe I can find some evidence
that would connect him to the killing.
You play pool?
Well, I'm familiar with the architectural
theory of dynamic symmetry...
as well as Descartes' theory
of coordinate geometry, um, lines, angles.
- You ever chalk a cue?
- Excuse me?
You can put away
your math books, Mr. Pepper.
They may help you learn how to play pool,
but they can't make you a pool player.
No. But you can.
Me?
Do it for Marvin.
All right. Let's pick you out a cue.
Okay.
That's for you.
See? Good.
Okay.
[Blows]
[Blows]
Fingers. Great.
Now turn your hips into it
and explode into the shot.
- Uh-
- Not bad.
I'll-I'll get it.
It's not the shot you're hittin'
you need to think about.
It's the one three strokes ahead.
Nine on the side.
Remember, pool is a mind game.
Make your opponent think about you,
and his game is lost.
<i>Can you do that?
You tell me.
Pleasure doing business with you, sir.
Excuse me? Mr. Fontenot
would like to have a drink with you.
Mr. Pepper.
Or may I call you Jarod?
- You know my name?
- I make it my business to know interestin' people.
You wanted to see me?
Well, I noticed that you shoot
a particularly fine game of pool...
<i>and I was certain that</i>
<i>you could appreciate this.</i>
Richard Black, custom.
Elephant ivory casing, golden diamond inlays.
<i>Cost me $50,000.
Does it sink the ball for you too?
Oh, touché.
Now, would you care to indulge me
in a game? Strictly for sport, of course.
- I never play for sport.
- Ah.
Is she a friend of yours?
Oh, no. Poor child
was raised by a bad element.
- A bad element?
- Primal, if you get my meaning.
<i>It so happens one of this element got himself</i>
<i>killed, and rumor has it she blames me.</i>
- Now please, join us.
- No, thank you.
He's a good pool player.
[Martin Luther King Jr.] Be transformed
into an oasis of freedom and justice.
I have a dream-
- [Applause]
- [King Continues]
[Young Jarod] Why do people hate other
people because of the color of their skin?
[Young Sydney]
I don't know, Jarod. It's called racism.
[Young Jarod]
Why do I have to look at this?
It's important that you learn what's wrong
in the world, as well as what's right.
I have a dream that one day-
Are they taught to do this?
In some ways, yes.
Jarod, there is no
simple solution to racism.
But there is.
Stop hating.
<i>[Young Sydney]</i>
<i>I wish it were that easy.</i>
It takes time and compassion.
Do you understand this, Jarod?
- [Crowd Cheering]
- I understand it.
<i>But I can't accept it.</i>
<i>[King] I have a dream that one day,</i>
<i>every valley shall be exalted-</i>
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>I'll never accept it.</i>
<i>[Sydney's Voice]</i>
<i>This anxiety over your father...</i>
is understandable, Miss Parker.
Symbolically speaking,
Bridget is taking your mother's position.
No... she's... not.
<i>[Sam Clears Throat]</i>
- I, uh-
- Yes?
I gained access to Brigitte's house
like you asked.
You broke in?
And?
Her medical records.
Your father would not
be happy to know...
you had his fiancée's
house burglarized.
Then let's not tell him.
- Broots?
- [Sighs]
Dissect this file and leave
no pap smear unturned. Sam!
<i>[Earl's Voice] Marvin was the closest thing</i>
<i>to a father Billie ever knew.</i>
- <i>She worshipped that man.</i>
- <i>[Computer Beeps]</i>
Marvin Dupree wasn't like
a father to you, Billie.
[Sighs]
He was your father.
Jarod.
Where'd you come from?
That's a question I should ask Billie.
The problem is,
she won't be able to answer me.
Why haven't you told her that
Marvin was her real father?
- What are you talkin' about?
- I found her birth records, Earl.
Why did your brother
keep this a secret from her?
He had his reasons.
She has a right to know who she is.
Billie's mother, Janis,
she sang at the club here.
Had a voice like honey.
She was a real nice lady.
She was also white.
When Marvin met her,
she was engaged to a local boy.
But they fell for one another...
and she took off with my brother
a few days before the weddin'.
After a year, Billie was born.
Now, when Janis's family realized
she had had Marvin's child...
<i>they told her take her black baby</i>
<i>and never come back.</i>
<i>When Janis took sick...</i>
she made Marvin promise that he would
never tell Billie that he was her father.
She thought that...
that would make the world
less cruel to Billie...
if they thought that
Marvin was a friend.
So he lied to her... to protect her.
Um- Uh, drinks first, then dinner.
Then... I'll climb up to the top of the roof
and jump headfirst into the driveway.
- Ma'am?
- It's just an old family tradition.
Relax, would you?
Your father and I are gonna
get along just swell.
S-S-Swell?
Oh, God.
This is never gonna work.
<i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>
Just-
[Exhales]
Okay?
Incredible.
<i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>
- Angel.
- Daddy.
- May we come in?
- Mmm.
Well, looks like you're already in.
We appreciate you hosting
this little shindig.
Damn floors. You know how slow
construction workers can be.
<i>Morons with hammers.</i>
- Bridget.
- Brigitte.
- Whatever. Daddy, this is Thomas.
- The construction moron.
Don't worry.
I left my hammer in my other outfit.
[Clears Throat]
Heard a lot about you, son.
Well, don't believe
everything that you hear.
Like what?
<i>[Knocking]</i>
Oh, I hope I'm not late.
- Tommy, this is my brother Lyle.
- Nice to meet you.
So you're the lucky guy
who won my sister's heart.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm the lucky guy.
What happened to your thumb?
Who needs a drink?
[Chuckling]
<i>[Fontenot's Voice]</i>
<i>I hope I'm not interruptin'.</i>
I was hopin' you and me and Mr. Black here
could play some pool.
- I already told you, I don't play for sport.
- Play for sport. I remember.
Nine ball.
500 a rack.
Let's play some pool.
<i>[Jarod] Nine in the corner pocket,</i>
<i>and your 500 in mine.</i>
<i>Well, that's pool,</i>
<i>isn't it, Mr. Fontenot?</i>
Sometimes the balls roll for you;
sometimes they don't.
<i>Let me buy you dinner.</i>
<i>[Fontenot]</i>
<i>I have a better idea.</i>
I propose a rematch, say,
later tonight at my place.
We can bump the action.
A thousand a game.
<i>Unless that's too rich for your blood.</i>
Well, I'll be playing
with your money, of course.
So if you can stand
the embarrassment, I can.
[Chuckles]
My driver will pick you up at 8:00.
<i>No, thank you.</i>
<i>I'd rather walk.</i>
Oh, you don't wanna walk alone
in this kind of neighborhood.
You wouldn't wanna end up dead
next to a Dumpster like Marvin Dupree.
<i>Would he, Earl?</i>
Patience, Earl.
Patience.
- [Clears Throat]
- [Clinks Glass]
Family and friend...
Brigitte and I have, uh,
set our wedding date.
- <i>This weekend.</i>
- Outstanding.
- Congratulations.
- <i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Daddy, um, why are you</i>
<i>rushing into this?</i>
<i>Well, it's because we are in love.</i>
<i>[Mr. Parker]</i>
<i>Time goes by very quickly.</i>
Mustn't waste a minute of it.
<i>A toast.</i>
<i>To the happy couple.</i>
- Thank you. I'll drink to that.
- Cheers.
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- Excuse me.
Mmm.
[Exhales]
What?
- I finished Brigitte's medical file.
- And?
Well, it's-
A lot of it's gynecological.
- It's kind of embarrassing to talk about.
- This ain't junior high, Broots.
We're adults.
Talk to me.
Well, it all looks legit.
A Dr. Noah Lindquist
diagnosed her as infertile...
due to complications
arising from endometriosis.
- But?
- I did some checking.
And according to the A.M.A.,
there is no Dr. Noah Lindquist...
practicing medicine in the United States
or anywhere for that matter.
She faked it all. He doesn't exist
and neither does her infertility.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>What's she up to, Miss Parker?</i>
- I don't know.
- <i>[Mr. Parker] Come on, angel.</i>
<i>It's time for charades.</i>
[Sighs] I thought the dinner party
from hell would never end.
<i>I made somethin'to help you sleep.</i>
Well, I thought that tonight
went, uh, pretty well.
Nobody died.
And Bridget seems like a-a nice person...
<i>and she makes your father happy.</i>
It's so hard to watch him
throw his life away like this.
Then don't.
If it's making you this miserable, maybe
you should stop spending time with them.
They're my family.
Maybe you should think
about starting a new one.
<i>[Earl's Voice]</i>
<i>She was also the one...</i>
<i>that found his body out</i>
<i>in the alley behind the club.</i>
<i>[Billie's Voice]</i>
<i>Marvin stands up at the club...</i>
<i>and tells everybody</i>
<i>how proud he is of me.</i>
<i>But that dream died</i>
<i>in the alley along with him.</i>
[Groaning]
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Let's see him sink a nine ball now.</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Where am I?</i>
- <i>[Fontenot] You're in my home.</i>
I did warn you
about that neighborhood.
Good thing my driver
happened by when he did.
<i>You might have been killed.</i>
I count my blessings.
Good for you.
Let's play some pool.
[Chuckling]
A valiant attempt.
<i>But as Hamlet said...</i>
<i>"As he was valiant, I honor him.</i>
As he was ambitious, I slew him."
Actually, Brutus said that...
trying to justify killing Julius Caesar.
But then he discovered there really is
no justification for cold-blooded murder.
So he killed himself.
Well, I'm sure if Brutus
thought a little harder...
he would have come up
with a better solution.
It doesn't take a genius to know that...
we live in a world where
only the truly fit can survive.
Meaning that the unfit should
be eliminated, like Marvin Dupree?
Marvin didn't know his place,
so he paid the price.
And what exactly was his place?
Why, in the back of the bus, of course.
<i>[Young Jarod's Voice]</i>
<i>I'll never accept it.</i>
- <i>[Young Sydney's Voice] It's called racism.</i>
- <i>I'll never accept it.</i>
I believe you owe me
another thousand dollars.
- Are you doing some remodeling?
- Pardon me?
I smell fresh paint.
Looks like you've just laid down
a brand-new carpet.
I like to keep
my home presentable...
<i>for special guests</i>
<i>such as yourself.</i>
Hmm.
- Another game?
- Not tonight.
Well, like you said, Mr. Pepper: Sometimes
the balls roll your way; sometimes they don't.
Why don't we play again tomorrow...
when both my arms are working?
Unless, of course,
you don't like the odds.
- It's a date.
- Good.
Tomorrow afternoon at Earl's.
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like to use your restroom.
By all means.
It's on your left, down the hall.
<i>Well, that's not</i>
<i>your average scrapbook.</i>
<i>Well, that's not</i>
<i>your average scrapbook.</i>
After Marvin was killed...
I collected every scrap of information
I could on Fontenot...
tryin' to figure out...
what would possess a man
to murder out of pure hate.
I found the answer in
an old Huntsville newspaper.
I've seen that picture.
It's in a frame
in Fontenot's poolroom.
<i>[Earl] Fontenot's daddy.</i>
<i>White sheets, burnin'crosses.</i>
Fontenot's father was a member
of the Ku Klux Klan.
Accordin' to people who would know.
I paid a visit
to Fontenot's house tonight.
He has two newly patched
bullet holes in his wall...
and he laid down
a brand-new carpet.
- To cover up Marvin's blood?
- He was trying to cover up something.
But he's not the only one.
<i>You told me that Billie's mother</i>
<i>left her fiancé...</i>
a few days before the wedding
and ran off with Marvin.
That's right.
You left out a pretty important detail
from that story.
<i>You told me that Marvin</i>
<i>was Billie's father...</i>
<i>but you didn't tell me</i>
<i>Eddie Fontenot was the fiancé.</i>
<i>Marvin was my daddy?</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Billie.</i>
- Marvin was my daddy.
- Billie-
- No.
No more lies.
- <i>[Classical]</i>
- <i>[Chattering]</i>
Ah.
I, uh- I haven't been this nervous
since the day you were born.
Uh, you and your brother.
- Daddy?
- Huh?
There's something I need to tell you
about Brigitte.
I know you have issues with her.
But people change.
Look at us, all dressed up
on my wedding day.
I'm happier now than
I've been in a long, long time.
Please try to be happy
for me, angel. Huh?
- God, you're pretty.
- So there you are.
- Mmm.
- Time to go.
Well, I can't keep
my bride waiting, now can I?
Okay.
<i>[Earl] Five games forJarod.</i>
<i>Five games for Fontenot.</i>
Run these, Jarod,
and the match is yours.
[Chuckles] You haven't run the table
all day, Mr. Pepper.
I can practically feel that $50,000
in my pocket now.
You know, I'm beginning to think
that 50,000 isn't enough.
Maybe we should put
some more on the line.
$50,000 is not enough for you?
I wasn't talking about money. I was
talking about something far more costly...
like, uh, honor.
What?
That is, after all, what you lost
to Marvin Dupree, isn't it?
I don't know what the hell
you are talkin' about, sir.
It finally occurred to me
that losing a game of pool...
<i>or being hustled by Marvin Dupree</i>
<i>for a few thousand dollars...</i>
wasn't why you killed him.
<i>No, you killed him...</i>
because of the color of his skin.
<i>You just couldn't keep that hatred</i>
<i>locked down anymore, could you?</i>
Who the hell are you?
Powerful hatred,
even from a bigot like yourself...
<i>knowing that your woman</i>
<i>ran off with a black man.</i>
You don't know anythin' about this.
Oh, I do know
that pictures never lie.
<i>Billie's mother was</i>
<i>supposed to be your wife...</i>
<i>before she ran off</i>
<i>with Marvin Dupree, that is.</i>
<i>And then there was that notorious</i>
<i>pool game between you and Marvin...</i>
when you lost your misguided honor
right there in your daddy's house.
That must have been
more than you could stand.
That boy deserved what he got.
<i>He was a man.</i>
<i>What he got...</i>
was your fiancée.
<i>I think they make</i>
<i>a fine-looking couple.</i>
Don't you?
Let's-Let's go.
<i>Well, don't you?</i>
- Billie, what are you doing?
- Well, don't you?
- I'm waitin' for an answer, Fontenot.
- <i>[Fires Gun]</i>
Yes. A handsome couple.
- <i>Billie, don't do this!</i>
- Stay out of it, Jarod!
- Billie, he's right.
- You too, Earl.
- Not even God can save him now.
- <i>[Jarod] Billie, please.</i>
<i>Tell me how you did it-</i>
<i>how you murdered my father in cold blood.</i>
She's crazy.
- Tell me!
- Talk to her!
I wanna hear you say it, now!
All right! Yes, yes!
I killed him! I killed Marvin!
And I'd kill the little animal again
if I could.
Get out of the way, Jarod.
Please.
<i>Please, get-</i>
Would your father want you to do this?
End the hate here, Billie.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Dearly beloved...</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Dearly beloved...</i>
we are gathered here to join this couple
in the bonds of holy matrimony.
<i>Do you, Brigitte, take this man to be</i>
<i>your lawfully wedded husband...</i>
<i>for richer or poorer,</i>
<i>in sickness and in health...</i>
till death do you part?
I do.
And do you, uh-
<i>I'm sorry. Uh-</i>
[Clears Throat]
Parker.
Thank you. Thank you.
Uh, do you, uh, Mr. Parker...
<i>take this woman to be</i>
<i>your lawfully wedded wife...</i>
<i>for richer or poorer,</i>
<i>in sickness and in health...</i>
- <i>till death do you part?</i>
- I do.
<i>Uh, the ring, please?</i>
If anyone has any objections
to the union of these two people...
<i>speak now,</i>
<i>or forever hold your peace.</i>
By the powers vested in me
by the great state of Delaware...
I hereby pronounce you
husband and wife.
<i>You may kiss the bride.</i>
[Laughing]
<i>[Classical]</i>
<i>Congratulations, Mrs. Parker.
I wish you and your husband
the very best.
Thank you, Mr. Raines.
I intend to do
everything in my power...
to make his golden years memorable.
I know <i>I'll</i> remember them.
- Ah.
- Count on it.
I think I'll get some cake.
Beautiful ceremony, wasn't it?
The virgin veil was a nice touch.
[Chuckles]
Do you need a little motherly advice?
Now that you mention it,
let's talk birth control...
as in the kind
Dr. Noah Lindquist provided for you.
<i>You do remember him, don't you?</i>
Then again, maybe you don't,
considering he doesn't exist.
Someone's been a busy little beaver.
Misinformed, but busy.
You lied to my father
about being infertile.
You get yourself pregnant, and that makes it
real difficult to trim you off the family tree.
My husband and I have
a very trusting relationship.
Just answer me this.
What kind of a beast uses the miracle of birth
to cement her own position in life?
A baby with your father
would be a child of love.
Nothing more, nothing less.
You were right
about one thing though.
If there were to be a child...
it would truly be a miracle.
Thank you.
<i>I wanna thank you all for comin'out</i>
<i>on this cold Memphis night.</i>
We got a special treat
for you this evening.
I can't do this.
Of course you can.
Just keep your father close to your heart.
You'll be just fine.
<i>Please, put your hands together...</i>
and give a warm welcome
to Miss Billie Dupree.
- <i>[Applause]</i>
- Go get 'em.
Whoo!
<i>[Piano]</i>
I'd like to dedicate this song
to my father, Marvin Dupree...
<i>and to the man</i>
<i>who helped me find him.</i>
Thank you, Jarod.
There's a somebody
I'm longing to see
I hope that he
<i>Turns out to be</i>
Someone who'll watch
Over me
<i>Where is that someone</i>
<i>To watch over me</i>
[Footsteps]
- <i>[Chattering]</i>
- [Horn Honks]
<i>[Honking Continues]</i>
All right. Here we are.
[Laughs]
Take it easy, Matthew.
See you. Bye-bye.
- Bye, Joe. Bye.
- <i>[Woman] Let's get your backpack, honey.</i>
- <i>[Girl] Bye.</i>
- Bye, Rachel.
- [Chattering]
- Take it easy. Have a good day. Bye-bye.
- Jarod, I'm really sorry.
- Don't mention it, Ben.
A bus trip isn't a bus trip
until somebody-
- How did you put it?
- Tosses their cookies.
- Cookies. Right.
- <i>[Man]Jarod, I can't figure it.</i>
I'm barely seeing enough pennies
to keep the lights on...
and then you show up out of nowhere,
and you fix up this old bus...
<i>and you're even taking the kids</i>
<i>on field trips to the air force base.</i>
It's better to give
than to receive.
I read that... someplace.
[Laughs]
How'd your dad like the base, Ryan?
Uh, Ryan's dad
couldn't make it.
He was on a business trip.
But we got to hang out, didn't we?
- Yeah.
- <i>You're a godsend, Jarod.</i>
Next thing I know, Ed McMahon'll
be knocking on that door...
with one of those
big cardboard checks.
- <i>[Horn Honks]</i>
- Hey, Jarod, there's my mom.
- Who's Ed McMahon?
- <i>See you later.</i>
- <i>Oh, hey, Ryan.</i>
- Yeah?
- Here. I got this for you.
- Cool. Thanks.
- Maybe you'll fly one, one day.
- Yeah.
Mostly, thanks for kind of
being my dad for the weekend.
- Sure. [Chuckles]
- <i>[Woman] Hey, you.</i>
Mom!
- <i>How was your trip, honey?</i>
- <i>[Ryan] Fantastic.</i>
- Yeah?
- Mom, this is Jarod.
- Cindy Wells. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- He's been talking about you all week.
- Look what he gave me.
- Wow.
- Can I stay up and show it to Dad...
- when he gets home tonight?
- Uh, yeah, we'll see.
- All right, top gun, into the cockpit.
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Jarod. See you later.
Thanks a lot.
His dad really
wanted to go with him...
but he's been away on business
longer than usual...
and Ryan misses him a lot.
I can imagine.
- He's a great kid.
- Thanks.
- Nice to meet you. Bye.
- <i>You too.</i>

Somebody call 911!
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
<i>[Siren Wailing]</i>
<i>[Woman On P.A.]</i>
<i>Cardiology interns, please report to O.R. 2.</i>
- <i>Cardiology interns-</i>
- My wife and son were brought in.
- Can you help me?
- Are you Mr. Wells?
- Yes.
- My name is Jarod.
- I was at the accident scene.
- Where are they?
- They're still in surgery.
- Oh, God. I just got back in town.
My firm's been
flying me all over.
- You're here now.
- Mr. Wells?
- I'm Ted Wells. How's my family?
- Your wife's gonna be just fine.
She suffered a concussion,
a dislocated shoulder.
- My boy?
- Your son sustained a severe abdominal trauma.
Both kidneys were damaged, one
beyond repair. We had to remove it.
<i>The other one</i>
<i>won't last long.</i>
- He needs a kidney transplant.
- He won't survive without it.
We're looking at
about a 48-hour window.
Okay, so- So what's next?
Ryan goes on some sort of priority list
or something, right?
Normally. Your son's blood carries
a unique leukocytic compound.
<i>It's a hereditary condition which makes</i>
<i>finding a donor much more difficult.</i>
- Your wife isn't a match.
- Well, then, I have to be, right?
- You can put me on that table.
- Ryan's condition needs to be stabilized first.
And we need to do a blood workup on you
to screen out any infectious agents. Okay?
I'll send a tech over
to draw a sample.
I don't know what I'd do
if I lost my family.
- Forgive me?
- For?
Being a neglectful brother.
Just because you were
nowhere to be found...
when I was in the hospital-
at death's door.
- You're too hard on yourself.
- Look, I know you're angry.
I don't blame you.
In fact, I got these for you.
<i>Candied snails?
- Yummy.
- Hey, those are hard to find.
No kidding.
Where have you been anyway?
I've had three solid leads on Jarod in the
last two weeks. You've shown zero interest.
I do have other
responsibilities.
Jarod is just one of them.
Excuse me, Mr. Lyle.
The phone man's here to see you.
- I'll be right there.
- He says he has other appointments.
I said I'd be there.
Phone man?
Big responsibilities.
Enjoy the snails.
<i>[Trash Can Rattles]</i>
[Gasps]
That's my good pillow.
You seem to be smiling
a lot these days, Miss Parker.
- Sneaking in downwind- clever.
- Hard at work.
- Micromanaging?
- A necessary evil...
considering your ongoing
lack of success.
You're building to a point,
I hope.
Your work has become unfocused.
Perhaps you're too distracted
with... personal affairs.
- Such as?
- Such as-
- Oh. Sorry.
- Stay, Broots!
Mr. Raines was just
slithering along, weren't you?
Priorities, Miss Parker- priorities.
What is it, Broots?
Well, I got this new
satellite TV dish- 223 channels...
high-definition digital, right?
- So I'm channel surfing in the shower-
- Wait a minute.
You have a television
in the bathroom?
Don't you?
Did you know that there's
a 24-hour disaster channel?
- Last night was train wrecks.
- Which is what this is becoming.
- Get to the point.
- Oh, no, no, wait, wait. Please, look.
I'll just
show you then, okay?
[Woman] Money problems
seem to be everywhere...
including this small
suburban church.
"Donations are the only way
we're able to survive"...
says Reverend Jack Collins
of his Little White Chapel.
If you're interested
in helping out Reverend Collins-
That's sweet. Send the change
from my desk drawer as a donation.
Oh, no, no, no! Wait.
You missed it.
<i>Right there.</i>
Hallelujah.
- Look who's seen the light.
- [Chuckles]
<i>[Sirens Wailing]</i>
- Anything you want me to bring you, pal?
- My airplane.
- Kind of like this one?
- Jarod.
<i>How you feeling, kiddo?</i>
Tired. My side hurts.
[Sighs] Here. I tell you what.
When you're feeling better...
we'll see about getting
this thing airborne.
Honey, why don't you
close your eyes for a bit?
The doctor said
you need to rest.
- Okay.
- <i>[Jarod] Ted?</i>
Any word on the transplant yet?
We're still waiting
on the blood work.
- I was just gonna go try and find the lab.
- No. I'll go check on it.
You stay with your family.
I don't know why you're
so interested in all this...
but I really appreciate
your help.
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>I'm fully aware of what "stat"means...</i>
but I'm a little
shorthanded down here.
<i>I understand. I know,</i>
<i>but my partner phoned in sick...</i>
<i>and the lab tech Dr. Conti promised</i>
<i>hasn't shown up yet.</i>
<i>Mm-hmm. I know.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I am so sorry I'm late.</i>
Oh. He just walked in.
- <i>Dr.</i> Conti gave me the wrong directions.
- <i>[Groans]</i>
- Boy, you look like you could use a break.
- <i>You have no idea.</i>
<i>Construction accident</i>
<i>has E.R. Packed.</i>
Everyone needs
their results yesterday.
[Chuckling]
Why don't you take a little break...
- and I'll start over here.
- Oh, how about I give you a hug.
- [Laughs] Have a good time.
- Okay.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Cindy?</i>
- Where's Ted?
- Oh, uh-
He went to go call
my parents.
Did you find out what's
taking the lab so long?
Why don't we go talk
in the hall?
What's wrong?
Is there a problem with the lab?
Your husband
isn't a donor match.
- That's impossible.
- Cindy-
I need to know the truth.
Ted isn't Ryan's father,
is he?
It's something I always feared,
but I didn't know for sure.
Look, I know
this isn't easy for you...
but if you want to save
your son's life...
I need to know who his father is,
and I need to know now.
His name is Luther Ecksley.
I met him right around the time
that Ted and I got together.
He was the total opposite ofTed.
He was dangerous and dark and-
I had seen Ted on a date
with another girl...
and I thought that being
with someone like Luther...
was the best way
to get back at him.
So you had a relationship
with this man?
It was a stupid fling.
I was young.
When I found out what kind of person
Luther really was, I went back to Ted.
But you found out
you were pregnant?
And you never told him
the truth?
There were a thousand times
that I wanted to.
And then a thousand times
I stopped myself...
'cause I was just too scared
of losing him.
<i>And the more time that passed, the more</i>
<i>itjust didn't really seem to matter.</i>
Ryan is Ted's son
in all the ways that count.
I need to find this Luther.
Do you know where he is?
[Sniffles]
I don't have a clue.
You said he was trouble.
Maybe he has a police record.
- I'll start with that.
- <i>Jarod?</i>
[Whispering]
Please don't say anything to Ted.
<i>Cindy, you can't keep this
a secret much longer.
The doctors are bound
to find the truth-
just like I did.
[No Audible Dialogue]
<i>[Rock]</i>
[Chattering]
What'll it be?
I'm looking for someone-
Luther Ecksley.
It's important.
Don't know the guy.
Does anyone know
who Luther Ecksley is?
[Groans]
What do you want
with Luther Ecksley, huh?
I just want to talk to him.
- <i>[Man] So start talking.</i>
- <i>[Jarod] You are not Luther.</i>
I'm as close
as you're gonna get.
Luther's rotting
in a Mexican prison...
and he's gonna be
for a long damn time.
[Groans]
You ain't never
gonna find Luther.
<i>[Man Laughs]</i>
<i>[Man Speaking Spanish On P.A.]</i>
<i>Gracias.</i>
Mr. Ecksley,
my name is Jarod.
Three years in this dump.
No visitors, no letters,
no phone calls.
Now all of a sudden I got some
humanitarian aid organization...
worried whether I'm
being treated right or not.
- I'm not here on your behalf.
- Is that right?
[Sighs]
- I give up.
- His name is Ryan.
He's eight years old,
and right now he's in a hospital...
in desperate need
of a kidney transplant.
- Yeah? Why are you telling me?
- He's your son, Mr. Ecksley.
Go on.
He has a rare blood condition-
inherited from you-
which means you are the only person
on this planet that can save his life.
- How?
- I'm going to try to arrange
for your temporary release.
You, uh, want me to donate
a kidney?
Your son's life
depends on it.
[Sighs]
This is a lot to think about.
There's no time
to think, Luther.
Either you do this now, or he dies.
Who's the, uh-
Who's the mother?
Her name was Cindy Brenner.
I remember her.
Is she all right?
She will be- if you do this.
Does the boy know about me?
No.
And I can't guarantee
you'll ever get to meet him.
We're running
out of time, Luther.
Do you believe in redemption, Jarod?
Maybe. You have a lot to make up for.
This could be
a start though, right?
<i>[Bell Ringing]</i>
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Damn, Broots.</i>
<i>Looks like wejust missed</i>
<i>the Sunday sermon.</i>
<i>[Organ]</i>
You ever go to church,
Miss Parker?
After the things
I've seen and done...
I think church is
the last place I should be.
Or maybe the first.
- Reverend Collins?
- You can call meJack. How can I help you?
We're looking
for this man.
He may have been
helping out around here.
Helping out?
Jarod's a damn angel.
You don't say.
Do you happen to know where
he may have flown off to?
You just missed him. He packed
his things and left early this morning.
Jarod was staying here?
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.
Hey, Max.
Several parishioners
offered Jarod a place to stay...
but he said he didn't want
to be any trouble.
Honestly, I had forgotten this basement
was here tillJarod suggested it.
That's Jarod-
always with an idea.
<i>[Collins]</i>
<i>He said he'd be back in a couple of days.</i>
<i>Actually, right now</i>
<i>he's already passed the border.</i>
- The border?
- As in Mexico?
<i>Yeah. He had a line on some</i>
<i>old pews we could get cheap.</i>
<i>Money's always</i>
<i>a little short around here.</i>
As I always say, "Pray to the Lord,
but buy a lottery ticket."
Take your time.
<i>Gotta go.</i>
<i>No rest for the wicked.</i>
<i>Well, looks like we're too late.</i>
<i>The place is clean.</i>
Yes, it is.
Miss Parker?
Wait. Where you going?
Don't mind us, Max.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>What do you got?</i>
A lottery ticket.
Leave it.
<i>[Jarod's Voice]</i>
<i>Warden, I don't think you understand.</i>
A child's life depends
on this decision. Please think carefully.
Luther Ecksley was caught
with 50 pounds of pure heroin.
Since he's been at my prison,
he's assaulted five of my guards.
We both know
he's not a saint...
but you didn't see his eyes when
I told him he could save his son's life.
Maybe you feel that he's undergone
some spiritual awakening...
but that man owes me and the people
I answer to 25 years of his life.
- I am only asking for a temporary release.
- What if something went wrong?
Huh? I don't have
the jurisdiction to go after him.
There are risks, granted. This boy's
life is worth it, don't you think?
I have a responsibility
to my country, to its laws.
Are you hearing a word
that I am saying?
Ryan's life is in your hands.
[Sighs]
I don't know if you can grasp
the pressures of my situation.
You know, the men that ran this prison
before I came were sadistic.
They treated those inmates
like animals.
Many men died, and many more
were tortured in unspeakable ways.
Those same sadistic men, they're
waiting for me to make a mistake...
to put them back in power.
I won't allow that to happen.
- Where does that leave Ryan?
- Contact your State Department.
Why don't you petition
the proper channels?
He doesn't have
that kind of time.
Well, I'm sorry.
I still can't help you.
- <i>Are those your children?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>
And what if it was
for one of them?
<i>As I said,</i>
<i>I can't help you.</i>
But if you're forced to resort
to more extreme measures...
I'd understand.
- [Buzzes]
- [Man] Yes, ma'am.
Take inmate Ecksley
back to his cell.
<i>He has the afternoon loading detail</i>
<i>in the compound today.</i>
- <i>[Man]</i> Sí, seńora.
- Good-bye, Jarod.
Good luck.
- Hi, Cindy. It's Jarod.
- Did you find Luther?
I'm working on it.
How's Ryan?
The doctors aren't telling me everything,
but I know it's bad.
<i>We're running out of time.</i>
I can't lose him, Jarod.
I know, but you
have to be strong.
Have you told your husband
the truth about Luther?
I tried. I really tried.
I just-
I don't wanna hurt him.
It's going to hurt him a lot worse
if he finds out the truth from somebody else.
He loves you.
Trust in that.
The rest will take care of itself.
[Beeps]
<i>[Ted]</i>
<i>You okay?</i>
Will you shut the door, honey?
We need to have a talk.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Ha. Talk about a bad dude.</i>
The mug shot you found
is three years old.
The guy's name
is Luther Ecksley.
He's doing 25 years
in a Mexican prison.
<i>Says here he was running drugs across</i>
<i>the border until an anonymous source...</i>
tipped off the Mexican police.
He's not a nice guy.
<i>Why would Jarod be involved</i>
<i>with someone like this?</i>
Let's ask Luther.
Thanks for kind of being
my dad for the weekend.
Do you believe
in redemption, Jarod?
<i>I can't lose him, Jarod.</i>
<i>If you were forced to resort</i>
<i>to more extreme measures-</i>
- Redemption-
- Thanks for kind of being my dad.
- I can't lose him.
- I'd understand.
<i>[Clattering]</i>
[Speaking Spanish]
[Speaking Spanish]
[No Audible Dialogue]
Do you want
to get out of here?
Hell, yes.
Redemption
doesn't come easy.
[Speaking Spanish]
[Horn Honking]
<i>Come on.
[Laughing]
We did it.
I can't believe it.
I'm free!
It's only temporary.
Don't you forget that.
You, uh, you got a plan
to get me back to the States?
Drive back roads
on the way to Tijuana.
Try to blend in
to tourist traffic.
I have a change of clothes for you in
this car, and I made you a fake passport.
Thought of everything,
didn't you?
There's no room for mistakes,
and no time.
[Groans]
Appreciate you springing me
there, Jarod.
The truth is, I could give a damn
whether that kid lives or dies.
<i>[Laughing]</i>
[Groans]
Aw, damn it!
<i>[Broots] Miss Parker, it looks like</i>
<i>they're locking down the whole prison.</i>
- <i>[Siren Blaring]</i>
- <i>[Warden Speaking Spanish]</i>
[Spanish]
<i>How long do you think</i>
<i>you can continue to hold us here?</i>
You've wasted an hour
of my time already.
Nobody enters or leaves until we've
completed a thorough search of this prison.
For all I know, you could be
involved in this escape.
That's ridiculous.
I told you already- he did it.
You arrived in my office
asking for Ecksley...
at the very moment that he
was discovered missing.
<i>For all I know,</i>
<i>you could be part of a diversion.</i>
An incredibly moronic one.
Why would we have stayed behind?
Why was he found outside,
hiding in a car?
Oh, Broots- He's always hiding.
He's like a cockroach.
Turn on the light, he runs.
Broots, tell her.
[Stammering]
It- She's right. Roach city.
[Sighs]
If you'll be patient a while longer-
<i>One of the guards we talked to</i>
<i>overheard Jarod saying...</i>
<i>One of the guards we talked to</i>
<i>overheard Jarod saying...</i>
something about needing
a kidney donor for a little boy.
Do you know what boy,
or where?
- That's the first I've heard of it.
- [Whispering]
<i>[Warden Speaking Spanish]</i>
- [Spanish]
- Huh?
- <i>[Spanish]</i>
- Sit.
Hang on, baby.
[Whispering]
Mommy loves you.
Ted.
- You didn't get Luther?
- Not yet.
You told Ted the truth.
Yeah, I don't blame him
for hating me. I hate myself.
He doesn't hate you.
It's just going to take him
some time to adjust.
Yesterday I woke up
with this near-perfect life.
Now my son is dying
and my husband-
<i>Cindy, you have</i>
<i>to remain strong...</i>
for Ryan.
<i>Everything is going</i>
<i>to work out-</i>
<i>I know it is.</i>
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>I found them.</i>
There are over a dozen
emergency cases nationwide...
but only one is a young boy
in need of a kidney.
- Where?
- San Diego.
Get us back
to San Diego, pronto.
<i>[Blues]</i>
Hundred dollars on Earl.
<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- No, no, no, no.
- <i>[Ringing Continues]</i>
This is Ray.
[Luther]
Ray, my boy.
- How you doing?
- Luther?
The one and only.
I hear you're doing real good
with my operation.
[Ray]
Uh, I'm doing okay.
[Luther]
Just okay, huh?
I got some news
that'll make your day.
See, I took a little vacation
from my permanent vacation, Ray.
Surprise. I'm out.
I'm back, and you're
the first person I thought to call.
I can't wait to see you, buddy. Ray?
- Ray? You still there?
- Well, yeah, I'm here.
Well, you and me
gotta get together.
I need to see where we stand
and what our next move should be.
How's, uh- How's midnight?
- Mission Bay Hilton.
- Tonight?
- Uh, what's the hurry?
- Ray-
Three years ago, some son of a bitch
tipped off the Mexican police...
and got me locked away.
Now I'm guessing that same
son of a bitch has my $10 million.
So you can understand why
I'm a little impatient, can't you?
Bring some old clothes,
Ray.
When we find this bastard...
it is gonna get messy.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>You look like you'vejust seen a ghost, Ray.</i>
Whoa. You just seem
a little bit jumpy, Ray.
<i>But I guess you would be,</i>
<i>being a marked man, after all.</i>
What the hell are you
talking about?
Was that Luther on the phone?
What did he want?
<i>Tell you that he was</i>
<i>back in town?</i>
- Wanted to fire up the old partnership?
- What?
He's setting you up, Ray.
But I guess that's
only fair- payback.
<i>After all, it was you</i>
<i>that tipped off the</i> federales...
and had your old buddy Luther
arrested at the border.
Screw you.
I went down to Hermosillo.
I was at his trial every day,
like a friend.
Or somebody who wanted
to look like a friend.
Personally,
I think it was overkill.
<i>I'll bet you Luther</i>
<i>thought the same thing.</i>
You're out of your mind.
Am I? Look over my shoulder
down the alley.
You see that car down there?
That's Luther, and he's waiting for you.
He's playing you, Ray.
He knows you're gonna lead him
to the money.
When you do,
he's gonna blow your brains out.
Now you better do
exactly what I tell you to do...
or you're never going
to walk out of this alive.
[Grunts, Groans]
<i>[Gunshots]</i>
So now what?
We're going to lead Luther to where
you hid the money just like he expects.
This better work, man,
or we're both dead.
Just keep driving.
Make sure you follow my plan.
Oh, this is crazy.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Find a good hiding place, Ray...</i>
and when I make my move,
you make yours.
Showtime.
<i>[Luther]</i>
<i>Ray?</i>
Give it up, Ray.
<i>I know you're the one</i>
<i>who stole my $ 10 million.</i>
- <i>[Clattering]</i>
- <i>[Luther] Oh, I get it.</i>
<i>Wanna play a little</i>
<i>hide-and-seek, huh?</i>
- <i>[Clattering]</i>
- Ray? Might as well come out.
<i>I ain't leaving</i>
<i>without my money.</i>
- <i>Getting tired of this, Ray.</i>
- <i>Oh, Luther?</i>
<i>Jarod?</i>
- <i>Surprise.</i>
- <i>I saw Ray shoot you in the alley.</i>
- <i>That was part one of my plan.</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah? What's part two?</i>
- Ray.
- [Grunts]
I tried to warn him.
Well, there's plenty of money
for both of us.
Oh, yeah.
I'll take that, Ray.
What? This is my money.
I stole it fair and square.
I know a little church
that deserves it a lot more than you do.
<i>I should have shot you</i>
<i>when I had the chance.</i>
You're right.
Thanks.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Come on, Luther. Wake up.</i>
<i>We've still got</i>
<i>some work to do.</i>
[Groans, Coughs]
<i>Disconcerting, isn't it?</i>
<i>Waking up in pain,</i>
<i>not knowing where you are.</i>
That's how I felt in Mexico.
<i>That's how your son feels</i>
<i>in his hospital room.</i>
What the hell are you doing?
- Are you out of your mind?
- Would you quit moving around?
- You're gonna knock your I.V. Out.
- This isn't a hospital.
Well, it'll do-
for what I need it for.
- You're not even a doctor!
- Technically, you're right...
but I do enjoy
that <i>E.R.</i> program.
- You can't do this!
- <i>Well, that's the beauty of it, Luther.</i>
You see...
I can.
<i>Nighty-night.</i>
<i>[Woman On P.A.] Dr. Roberts,</i>
<i>extension 15. Dr. Roberts, extension 15.</i>
<i>Cindy. I just spoke to the nurse.
The kidney seems to be taking.
I think he's gonna be just fine.
I've gotta call my parents.
Jarod, thank you so much
for everything that you have done.
Thank you.
- Your son's going to make it.
- My son?
For nine years
I've been living a lie-
thinking I was
someone I wasn't.
Were you?
I see that boy's face
when he looks at you.
The way he talks about you.
You don't understand.
I do.
Right now you're angry,
and you're hurt, and you're confused.
But if you leave that boy
without a father-
if you walk away
from him now-
That's a wound
that will never heal.
If there's ever anything
I can do for you-
[No Audible Dialogue]
It's funny that you
should mention that.
Gotten by us?
We've been here the entire time.
Pipe down.
[Whispering]
These people are afterJarod.
<i>Excuse us,</i>
<i>Mr. And Mrs. Wells?</i>
He was here, wasn't he?
Jarod? Helped you?
I don't know anyone

<i>So if you'll excuse us,</i>
<i>we'd like to be left alone.</i>

<i>You know what I don't get?</i>
I checked the records here.
There's no Luther Ecksley.
Whatever happened to him?
<i>[Warden]</i>
<i>What do you think, Dr. Mendoza?</i>
Whoever did this certainly
knew what they were doing.
Yes, he did.
Let's prepare
to transfer the prisoner.
[Groans]
<i>[Radio Frequencies Tuning]</i>
<i>[Man] That, my friend, is grade-A,</i>
<i>American-made bear squat.</i>
<i>[Man #2 On Speaker]</i>
<i>But I got an air force fax.</i>
<i>It says the Trilateral Commission</i>
<i>was inside Area 51 on June 10, 1974.</i>
Right. And M.J. Is still bringin' the ball up
at the United Center.
<i>Now listen,</i>
<i>my little misguided friend.</i>
I may be working at the tiniest radio station
in the city of Chicago...
but our microphones work!
A fax is not an original!
- <i>Well, it could be.</i>
- Survey says- [Imitates Buzzer]
<i>Moron!</i>
Folks, please, come on.
We're smarter than that. What is my credo?
"Never stop questioning."
This is the Neil Roberts program...
broadcasting live from the bunker
somewhere deep inside the Loop.
My own little corner of anonymity.
Now, if somebody has
a real conspiracy out there-
something worth firing my synapses over-
please do give me a call.
<i>[Woman] We've got a listener on a cell phone</i>
<i>with a comment on that last call.</i>
<i>[Deejay] That would be the voice of my lovely</i>
<i>and talented producer, Angela Somerset...</i>
who's in our main studio
back at the corporate high-rise.
It's an old friend on line one.
The Middleman.
Double-M! Now, hit me!
There is no way the Trilateral Commission
was in Area 51 that day.
They were in Delaware.
- How do you know that?
- <i>We had brunch.</i>
I sat on the other side
of a two-way mirror...
eating optimized nutritional supplement.
Eating what?
It's a long story.
[Deejay]
You still running from the P.T.B.'s?
- P.T.B.'s?
- Ah, you're slipping, Middleman.
The powers that be.
What'd they do to you, anyway?
They separated me from my family
when I was a little boy.
I barely remember my mom and dad.
I've been searching for them for a long time.
Well, I have no sardonic response to that...
only to say that...
that kind of dedication
comes from deep within.
I kind of envy you.
I don't have anyone that close...
with the exception of one person, and...
she doesn't even know I exist.
But that, my friend, is a very long story,
and I know you've got to run.
- As always.
- Take care.
And, as always, a very enlightened call
from our friend, Double-M.
<i>Let's now go to a disgruntled caller</i>
<i>on a mobile phone.</i>
Hit me!
Hey, squealer, you get my postcard?
Well, you know, my friend,
I get bushels of fan mail every day.
<i>I sent a package this time.</i>
<i>Express.</i>
<i>Ah, here is it. The package.</i>
<i>You hear me opening it on the air.</i>
- Here we are.
- <i>[Caller] Hope it's not over the top.</i>
- Oh, God!
- <i>Yeah, it's a dead rat.</i>
<i>Sort of symbolizes your status in life.</i>
<i>Choices made.</i>
<i>Choices to live with. Or die from.</i>
<i>Like the song says,</i>
<i>"This is the end, my friend."</i>
<i>Watch out for that cheese, Neil.</i>
<i>[Neil]</i>
<i>I'm sorry, Patty.</i>
<i>[Caller] Hey, Neil, you still there?</i>
<i>I don't hear anything.</i>
- [Beeping]
- [Beeping On Line]
<i>What's the matter, Neil?</i>
<i>Rat got your tongue?</i>
<i>Love to see the expression</i>
<i>on your face right now.</i>
<i>In fact, that's just what I'll do!</i>
<i>[Radio. Gunshots]</i>
Die, rat!
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent every moment
searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
<i>[Caller] If Neil was attacked,</i>
<i>how come the police aren't all over it?</i>
Because Neil broadcasts from
an unknown location in the city.
Neil, if you're listening, please call.
It's been 37 minutes.
We're worried about you.
[Caller] Cut the crap, lady! It's another
one of Neil's damn publicity stunts.
- <i>Hey, moron!</i>
- Who's this?
If Neil's mission in life is to
expose conspiracies and lies...
do you think he'd create one?
[Caller]
Hell yes!
Then go back to the village, pal.
The one missing the idiot.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>You're listening to WLNJ, Talk Radio.</i>
- I can explain.
- Explain it to the police.
You would have called them after Neil
was attacked if you wanted them involved.
- Who the hell are you?
- Someone running from the P.T.B.'s.
- Middleman?
- My name is Jarod.
[Sighs]
I know you're very afraid for Neil.
I could hear it in your voice.
Look, I know this sounds crazy...
but trust me.
Let me use this show
to help you find Neil.
We're back.
And you're listening to the Middleman.
<i>While we wait for word from Neil...</i>
I'm going to tell you a little story
that's both near and dear.
It's about a boy that was raised by
an organization shrouded in secrecy...
a Delaware corporation unlike any other.
Weird, I know.
But the truth often is.
<i>[Watch Alarm Beeping]</i>
[Alarm Stops]
Mmm.
You gotta learn to sleep in.
[Whistles]
That was the Realtor.
- Are they gonna buy the place?
- They already did.
I was gonna tell you earlier, but-
You don't have to clear it with me.
There's something else.
I bought a new house for us to restore...
<i>together.</i>
It's in Portland.
I love Maine.
Oregon.
<i>Come with me, Parker.</i>
- To Oregon?
- Why not?
Well, first of all, I have a career.
Oh, right. The same career
that gave you an ulcer and nearly killed you.
It's not just the job.
It's my family.
You buy a plane ticket.
You visit.
You don't know my family.
Look, it's just not a decision...
I can make right now,
here, in my bathrobe.
What are you scared of?
Nothing.
You're just asking a lot.
I need to leave soon.
<i>[Caller's Voice] Your status in life.</i>
<i>Choices made. Choices to live with.</i>
<i>Or die from.</i>
<i>Like the song says,</i>
<i>"This is the end, my friend."</i>

<i>[Phone Rings]</i>
Neil, where are you?
I'm coming to your place right now.
<i>Neil called you before</i>
<i>he was attacked, didn't he?</i>
You wanted to call the police,
but he begged you not to. He insisted.
He told me to keep up appearances
until he called again...
and to stay away from his place.
"It's life and death," he said,
"and not just mine."
- And then he said-
- What?
He said, "Ang, if you don't hear from me
tomorrow, I'm gone...
forever."
Then we don't have much time.
Nobody heard a thing.
I told him not to live
in an abandoned building.
They're the best places to hide.
He shot through the door.
<i>Then fired at Neil.</i>
<i>Chased him along this wall.
The grenade landed over there.
Neil's only escape
was through this door.
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>My God. Neil's blood.</i>
He got out alive.
<i>Jarod left this sign for us</i>
<i>outside his place in Chicago.</i>
But this house is in Blue Cove.
- Traffic was a bitch.
- Or you slept in.
Isn't that your plumber's house?
Thomas is a carpenter.
And, yes, he sold it. So?
Jarod can read the classifieds.
- Is your boy leaving town?
- Oregon. Maybe.
Now, <i>that</i> commute <i>is</i> a <i>bitch.</i> Call me
when the Cleaners are back from Chicago.
- Don't give me that look, Syd.
- Thomas is moving, isn't he?
He wants you to go?
To leave Blue Cove?
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Leave the Centre?</i>
Your father's gonna freak.
Thanks for pointing that out.
Parker, a long time ago
I lost a family...
because the powers that be
chose my path.
Don't let them dictate yours.
- <i>So, who is she?</i>
- <i>Someone this psycho knows is important to Neil.</i>
- Neil's daughter?
- Maybe.
One thing's for certain-
she means the world to him.
Although they never met.
You got all that from a postcard?
[Neil] I don't have anyone that close
with the exception of one person...
and she doesn't even know I exist.
We have to think like he thinks.
Feel what he feels.
- "Never stop questioning."
- Neil's sign-off?
Albert Einstein once said,
"The most important thing is to never stop...
questioning."
<i>[Angela] This stuff is all about</i>
<i>the girl on Neil's bulletin board.</i>
[Jarod]
He's documented her entire life.
<i>Her name is Patricia Marie Lorenz.</i>
<i>She's 19 years old.</i>
She's had a degenerative nerve disorder
since she was a little girl.
We find her, we may find Neil.
<i>Or the guy who's chasing him.</i>
This psycho's not gonna let up, is he?
No. He's going to
keep following him.
Hunt him down like an animal...
keep him from
the people he loves...
make his world a living hell...
till it ends, one way or another.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I mean, come on!</i>
What kind of low forehead
sends dead rats through the mail?
<i>[Female Caller] It's the television, Double M.</i>
<i>It makes us do things.</i>
Tsk-tsk-tsk.
Only if you let it.
- Well, I gotta go.
Urkel's sending me a secret message.
- [Dial Tone]
[No Audible Dialogue]
My next caller, please.
[Man] They can replace that son of a bitch,
but Neil can't hide.
And why should he have to?
- You'll have to ask him.
- [Train Crossing Bell Clanging,
Train Horn Blaring]
He forced this.
He put his own ass in my crosshairs.
How did he do that?
<i>He ambushed my life</i>
<i>with a sucker punch.</i>
<i>But actions have consequences.</i>
And this time around, I'm in control.
[Jarod]
<i>Control?
<i>Like ringing a little bell?</i>
It's not the bell.
It's who's ringing it.
I guess that's you, Pavlov.
It is okay if I call you Pavlov,
isn't it?
Maybe you should call me P.T.B.
Oh. Are you one of
the powers that be?
I'm the only one.
[Crossing Bell Continues Clanging]
Pavlov? You still there?
<i>You haven't disappeared</i>
<i>on me, have you?</i>
<i>Neil took away</i>
<i>what was important to me.</i>
<i>Maybe I'll return the favor.</i>
<i>If you're such a powerful P. T.B.,</i>
<i>why not tell us who you are?</i>
[Pavlov]
No, no.
<i>Anonymity.</i>
<i>That's where the real power is.</i>
Even Neil, the coward,
would tell you that.
He had to get me
with my back turned.
Now I'm the shooter
in the book depository.
Now I'm the shooter
in the book depository.
<i>I'm the bullet you don't see comin'.</i>
<i>[Jarod] We all have the right</i>
<i>to face our accusers.</i>
Oh, what a lovely thought.
<i>Maybe you could write that</i>
<i>in Neil's eulogy, huh?</i>
<i>[Engine Starts]</i>
<i>[Man] You're listening to WLNJ,</i>
<i>talk radio for Chicago.</i>
Did you hear that?
He's near the "L" train.
As long as he's nowhere near Neil.
<i>[Beeping]</i>
[Ringing]
- Neil!
- Angela-Angela-
Neil, thank God.
Where are you?
That was him on the air.
The son of a bitch isn't gonna quit.
I found someone who can help.
- Neil, this is the Middleman.
You have to stop running.
- [Crossing Bell Clanging]
Stay out of this. You don't know
what you're dealing with.
<i>[Train Horn Blaring]</i>
I know about Patricia Marie.
<i>No!</i>
Not Patty.
You stay away from Patty. You hear me?
- It's hard enough with one-
- Neil, listen to me. Get out of there right now.
Just go!
- Neil!
- <i>[Engine Starts]</i>
<i>[Angela] I can't reach him. The police</i>
<i>don't know anything. It's over, Jarod.</i>
It's encrypted.
- I forgot who I was dealing with.
- Even I don't know his password.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>"The New Vista Foundation."</i>
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>Neil never mentioned anything about it.</i>
<i>He's made some sizable donations.</i>
<i>It supports research for nerve disorders.</i>
It also pays bills
for Patricia's at-home care.
<i>According to this, he had her moved to</i>
<i>a new apartment about six months ago.</i>
Right after the threats started.
[Grunts]
[Humming]
Angel. I was just admiring
how well you turned out.
Daddy, l-
- Damn.
- We need to-
I could use some help from that friend of yours.
What's his name? Tom?
- [Grumbles]
- Here.
Actually, I'm glad
you mentioned Thomas.
He's-
Got a new project.
I know. Oregon.
- It's kinda far away, isn't it?
- How do you know?
Your brother's a damn gossip.
I cannot imagine my daughter
hanging wallpaper. [Chuckles]
Who knows?
I might be good at it.
No, trust me.
Renovating an old house
is like pounding sand down a rat hole.
It never ends.
Besides, what would I do
without my angel?
Hey, did I ever tell you
why I call you that?
No.
You were about three-and-a-half years old.
We were at the summer place.
My place.
I was high up on a ladder...
trying to fix a leak in the skylight
over your mother's studio.
I was about to take the last step
when suddenly you screamed...
"Daddy! Broken!"
Sure enough, taking that last step,
I'd have fallen 30 feet down onto the rocks.
You saved my life.
Your mother said
you were my guardian angel.
[Laughs]
You leave me...
I might as well be dead.
<i>[Patty] My parents were killed</i>
<i>in an accident at Fort Bragg when I was little.</i>
<i>I don't know what I would have done</i>
<i>without the New Vista Foundation.</i>
It wasn't the money either.
It was the tapes.
They've been sending these
every month for years.
Some are philosophical.
Some are inspirational.
Some, just stories.
Always the same voice.
<i>These books helped me</i>
<i>learn, get focused...</i>
opened up the world for me...
helped me see the possibilities
I'd given up on.
I write for Web sites now.
[Laughs]
For the longest time, I tried to find out
who was funding the foundation...
but I never got close.
Do you mind if we listen
to a little bit of the tape?
No.
[Neil] Anna and Vronsky
found themselves alone in the square...
<i>waiting for the snow to fall.</i>
- <i>It had been several hours since their last meal.</i>
- <i>[Tape Player Clicks Off]</i>
- All I had was him.
- It's a nice voice.
I know he's just
their reader and all...
but he sounds so... real.
You know?
I rejected a lot of people, but...
irony of ironies...
I couldn't reject him,
'cause I don't know him.
I think of him as a guide.
He's kind of the reason
I'm still fighting...
still alive.
Neil dedicates his life to her.
Now he's in danger because of her?
- She doesn't even know who he is.
- It's another dead end.
Not exactly.
Pavlov is still out there.
We just have to get him talking again.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I'll tell you about the powers that be.</i>
When they can't get to you...
they go after
the people that you love.
That's what they did to Neil.
The P.T.B.'s try to rip these people
out of your life.
Your guts right along with them.
But that's where
they make their mistake...
because the people that you love
may be a weakness...
but they're also your strength.
<i>They keep you fighting.</i>
They keep you one step ahead of the demons
who breathe fire into your soul.
[Angela]
Line one. It's him, Jarod. Pavlov.
- Go ahead, line one.
- [Pavlov] You've got me in tears over here.
Tears of laughter.
Why don't you stop
hiding behind your phone?
I've been inside your head.
<i>I don'tjust see a tortured maggot.</i>
No, I see a lonely, pathetic man
whose only companions are his rage...
<i>and the power ofhis anonymity.</i>
You sound a lot lonelier
than I'll ever be.
What, not enough love
from Mom and Dad?
Yeah, I've been listening
to your kidnapping sob story.
My parents aren't exactly
the issue here.
[Pavlov] No, I'm guessing
they're your whole life.
The life you're desperately
looking for night and day.
Those little doubts, they gotta be
gnawing in your gut right now.
And what doubts are those?
[Pavlov]
Maybe my folks wrote me off.
Maybe they think that
their little boy is dead.
Maybe they're dirt-nappin'.
Here you are,
runnin' all over creation searching...
and they're nothing but worm food.
You know something, Pavlov?
When I find you-
You're never gonna find me.
I'm one of Neil's secrets.
A contradiction inside a paradox,
wrapped up in an enigma.
The kind of conspiracy
that even he can't reveal.
<i>You forgot something, orphan boy.</i>
- What's that?
- I know where you work.
<i>[Line Clicks, Dial Tone]</i>
[Man] You're listening to WLNJ,
talk radio for Chicago.
The trace is no good.
[Inaudible]
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Parker, a long time ago...</i>
<i>I lost a family because the powers that be</i>
<i>chose my path.</i>
<i>Don't let them dictate yours.</i>
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Your father's gonna freak.</i>
<i>[Mr. Parker] Your mother said</i>

<i>You leave me...</i>
<i>I might as well be dead.</i>
[No Audible Dialogue]
<i>[Typing]</i>
<i>Fort Bragg. That's where</i>
<i>Patty's parents died.</i>
<i>[Car Door Opens, Closes]</i>
[Groans]
You're making a mistake.
Give me the gun.
You're workin' for him?
Pavlov said that he was one of your secrets.
What does that mean?
None of your business!
- You just stay away from Patty.
- He'll kill her.
You were in her apartment.
Why?
I was trying to find you
so I could help you.
<i>She's not your daughter.</i>
<i>Who is she?</i>
She's someone I don't deserve.
That's not true.
You made her a fighter.
Oh, God,
she shouldn't have had to fight!
I was a doctor.
In the army.
How did you hurt her?
Her disorder is congenital.
Spare me the official line of crap!
Patty's mother was a patient.
No, she- she was a subject.
An experiment?
Government sponsored.
[Moans]
Half of me wishes
that it was one big conspiracy.
I could just laugh it off on my show.
But we were just
testing vaccines on soldiers.
Very routine stuff, or so I thought.
Well, we knew Patty's mom
was pregnant.
When some test results came back...
that suggested that she might
have an adverse reaction...
I was told to let it go.
So I did.
I was a coward.
<i>I convinced myself</i>
<i>that my superiors knew better.</i>
I got transferred cross-country,
and I ignored the consequences.
Until I heard about the car crash.
That's when you found out
about Patty's disorder.
And that's when you started
providing for her.
[Sobs]
Oh, God.
I didn't speak up.
"Never stop questioning."
<i>Neil, you've dedicated</i>
<i>your whole life to speaking up.</i>
To everybody but her.
Pavlov is right.
I'm a fraud.
I mean, I bitch
about telling the truth...
but, irony of ironies...
the one person I care most about
will never hear the truth from me...
because I don't have
the guts to tell her.
<i>[Mr Lyle]</i>
<i>"The powers that be are everywhere.</i>
They take your loved ones
away from you."
- Who wrote this drivel?
- Nobody.
A talk show host said it.
Our Chicago monitors picked it up.
WLNJ Radio has a new talk show host.
He's railing against us.
<i>Calls himself the Middleman.
- Hmm.
- The middle. The Centre.
Ya think?
- I want a Sweeper team out there.
- I've already dispatched two.
So, are we back?
Meaning?
Oh, I just heard that you were making plans
with the shop teacher.
[Rings]
Lyle.
Yeah, she's right here.
[Beeps]
Security in Concourse 4.
Shop teacher's here.
[Exhales]
This place is
locked up like Alcatraz.
What are doing here?
You didn't mean what you said.
That wasn't you talking.
It was your father. It was this place,
whatever the hell this place is.
It's so easy for you, isn't it?
You waltz into somebody's life,
rip it apart like it was some damn remodeling job...
keep your favorite parts
but throw out the rest.
No consequences.
No commitment.
This <i>is</i> a commitment.
<i>Can't you see that?
I see someone whose only
connection to the world...
is an empty house, a box of nails
and a rusted pickup truck.
I don't have that luxury.
I have obligations.
I have relationships.
Obligations? Relationships?
You make it sound
so personal, so warm.
All your mail is stamped "Occupant,"
your phone number's unlisted...
and I have yet to meet
even one of your so-called friends.
- I have a life.
- Which you refuse to share.
That's not a life, Parker.
It's a life sentence.
Parker!
Please, don't make me
leave part of my life here.
Please.
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
[Ringing Continues]
I'm sorry.
I don't want to hurt you, Tommy.
No, it's- it's me.
[Sighs]
Jarod.
You got another
clever message for me?
I only wanted you to know
that Thomas was selling.
From the sound of your voice,
you've already discussed it.
Yeah.
He's moving to Oregon.
He wants me to go with him.
So go.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
It's too late anyway.
You picked a fight with him, didn't you?
This isn't what you want, Miss Parker.
- Why does everybody suddenly know what I want?
- Your mother always knew.
She was trying to leave the Centre
the day she was killed.
She wanted to take you
as far away from there as possible.
That's what Thomas wants.
It's no coincidence.
[Beeps]
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>The Federal Archives were a gold mine.</i>
Pavlov is Colonel Willard Spence.
Spence?
He was one of my superiors.
And after he got you transferred,
he intensified his drug experiments.
I did a bunch of shows on the subject
when I first got on the air...
how the army was pumping soldiers
full of potentially lethal experimental drugs...
without telling them.
<i>Well, your shows got the army nervous.</i>
They shut Spence down.
Some families tried to sue,
but of course they lost.
The brass conducted
an internal investigation.
They convicted Spence and locked him up
in Leavenworth for seven years.
- That's a long time.
- Time enough to develop a heck of a grudge.
He blames you
and your radio show...
for ratting him out.
Jarod, his parole office is in Olympia Fields.
That's close to Patty.
We'll find him.
<i>Army Intelligence.</i>
<i>Very clever contradiction of terms.</i>
<i>I suspect you're a very clever man.</i>
You know, I've been tracking reports
of another clever person.
Very mysterious.
<i>Shows up at unexpected spots.</i>
Always there to help
the needy and the abused.
<i>[Neil] You didn't think I'd tell my secrets</i>
<i>to any schmo, did you?</i>
Why didn't you expose me on the air?
Nah.
No, I only go after bad conspiracies.
<i>[Footsteps]</i>
Neil?
Hi.
- It's good to see you.
- You too. I'm so glad you're okay.
There were some people down at the station.
They asked forJarod.
<i>Guys in suits.</i>
<i>One answering to the name Sam.</i>
- Sweepers.
- Who are they?
The powers that be.
<i>[Mr. Lyle] The Sweeper team's in place in</i>
<i>Chicago, and we're stuck waiting in Blue Cove?</i>
No one at the Centre has seen Miss Parker,
and she's not answering her cell phone.
Well, that's it.
We're out of here.
- Lyle.
- She made her decision, Doctor.
I'm makin' mine.
Yeah, this is Lyle.
Let's go.
<i>[Jarod On Radio] It's another deep,</i>
<i>dark night out there...</i>
<i>and you're back for another session</i>
<i>with the Middleman...</i>
<i>and my guest, Neil Roberts.</i>
<i>[Neil]</i>
<i>Thanks for subbing for me, Middleman.</i>
<i>[Jarod] I'm just glad that our wacko friend</i>
<i>Pavlov wasn't able to hurt you.</i>
[Sam] Mr. Lyle! Jarod must have gotten
upstairs through another entrance.
The show's already started.
<i>[Jarod] Oh, look who's on line one.</i>
<i>Go ahead, Pavlov.</i>
- You shouldn't have done this.
- Why not?
Neil's <i>ready.</i> Come down to the studio
and get your revenge.
Pass your sentence, P.T.B.
I will, but not where you expect.
Oh, that's right. You're an enigma
wrapped up in a paradox.
<i>[On Loudspeaker]</i>
<i>Or is it the other way around?</i>
<i>The powers that be</i>
<i>don't call the shots anymore.</i>
- <i>[Pavlov] We always call the shots, orphan boy.</i>
- Excuse me-
<i>That's why they call us</i>
<i>the powers that be.</i>
Well, look here.
The powers that aren't.
[Groans, Muffled Shout]
Show's all yours, Neil!
<i>[Jarod] Now it's time for</i>
<i>a commercial break. Don't go away.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>A funny thing about traps.</i>
They don't discriminate between
the hunter and the hunted.
[Screaming]
I'm sorry to have stolen your metaphor,
but it really is perfect.
Rat. Trap.
Rat. Trap!
Gotcha!
Let me out of here!
You really stepped into this one,
didn't you, Pavlov?
Or should I call you Doctor?
- Dr. Willard Spence?
- Let me out!
I wonder how many times
Patricia Marie said that to herself.
<i>She was one of your victims. You just</i>
<i>trapped her in a different kind of way.</i>
Look.
Pictures of human lab rats.
<i>People that you decided</i>
<i>didn't deserve to know the truth.</i>
Lab rats. Guinea pigs.
<i>Human experiments. People!</i>
I went to prison for that!
You don't know
the first thing about prison!
<i>Sometimes the worst kind of prison...</i>
is the kind that you have to
wake up to every morning...
when you think
you're out free in the world...
and you're being hunted and stalked!
That's what you did
to Neil Roberts, isn't it?
<i>Just because he told the truth.</i>
<i>You look a little pale, Doctor.</i>
It's a good thing I read your file.
Diabetes. What a shame.
And it's about time
for your insulin shot.
<i>Before you do that,</i>
<i>I should warn you-</i>
<i>only one of those syringes</i>
<i>contain insulin.</i>
<i>The other two,</i>
<i>a potentially lethal experimental drug.</i>
But whatever's good enough
for Dr. Spence's subjects...
is good enough for him.
Mmm.
Sugar.
- Yum.
- You're crazy!
You could try that
eeny-meeny-miney-mo thing.
<i>But I gotta tell you,</i>
<i>as a probability quotient...</i>
it kinda sucks.
Good luck picking.
No, wait! Wait! I'll die.
I'm giving you a better chance
than you gave Neil Roberts.
<i>Have fun playing spin the syringe.</i>
Okay! Okay!
I stalked him!
I wanted to kill him!
He ruined my life!
I swore that I would ruin his!
<i>Which one has the insulin?</i>
Actually, all three of them do.
<i>Enjoy the cheese.</i>
- [Pavlov] I stalked him!
- Neil's next show.
I wanted to kill him!
It's gonna be a real doozy.
<i>Good evening, Chicago.</i>
<i>Uncle Neil is back and in one piece,</i>
<i>I'm happy to say.</i>
Hey. It's the voice.
I know that voice.
It's him, isn't it?
And he's expecting you.
<i>[Neil]</i>
<i>But before we get to the phones...</i>
<i>I need to take care</i>
<i>of some very personal business.</i>
<i>There's something I have been</i>
<i>wanting to tell a special someone...</i>
<i>for a very long time now.</i>
<i>Patty, I only hope that</i>
<i>once you've heard the truth...</i>
you will forgive me.
Is that a "yes"?
There are things about me-
things that you need to know
before you make me...
a part of your life.
Parker, there are-
You were right.
That wasn't me talking.
I haven't been me for a long time.
Not since-
Loving you made me realize that-
that there...
are places in me-
Tommy, dark places.
<i>And you're afraid that if I see them,</i>
<i>that I'll reject you?</i>
Parker.
If something is not right,
we'll deal with it together.
I'm a fix-it man, remember?
- I guess that makes me your new project.
- <i>Yeah.</i>
And this one I'll never sell.
<i>[Neil's Voice]</i>
<i>Sooner or later we all hit a crossroads.</i>
<i>As some of you know,</i>
<i>I recently hit one. A big one.</i>
But I made it through,
thanks to a new friend.
I know you're out there listening,
Middleman.
<i>You watch your back</i>
<i>and don't ever quit...</i>
<i>because somewhere up ahead...</i>
<i>you'll find your crossroads.</i>
<i>Good night, Chicago.</i>
You look like the cat
that ate the rat.
The hunt is over.
Outstanding.
- Corner-office time, angel.
- Corner office?
- Daddy, I'm out of here.
- You're leaving the Centre?
We had a deal.
I bring backJarod,
and I walk out on my own terms.
Daddy?
This is just the beginning, angel.
<i>[Wheels Squeaking]</i>
<i>[Laughing]</i>
[Gasping]
It's okay. It's okay.
You're awake. It's over.
No, you're wrong.
It'll never be over.
<i>[Jarod] You don't owe me anything,</i>
<i>Mrs. Hartunian.</i>
- <i>Jarod, please call me Rita.</i>
- <i>Rita.</i>
Where I come from,
people show gratitude.
<i>You saved my store from that extortionist</i>
<i>who calls himself a landlord.</i>
I owe you.
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>
Okay.
- Oh, you like lottery?
- I've never actually played one before.
Ah. Here.
Take, scratch, enjoy.
Thank you.
Well, uh, according to the odds,
your chances of winning the jackpot...
are one in 13,983,816.
Well, that's the same odds
as getting hit by lightning in a submarine.
- Look, you bring me good luck.
Maybe I do same for you.
- <i>[Doorbell Jingles]</i>
Okay, I'll give it a try.
[Laughs]
- Oh, my-
- Are you all right?
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
- It's just- It fell over.
- [Rita] All over the floor.
Hey! Hey!
<i>Get back here!</i>
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>
[Gasps, Grunts]
Are you all right?
Stay right there.
It's my backpack.
And Mrs. Hartunian's cash.
- What's your name?
- None o' ya.
- None o' ya?
- Yeah. None of your business.
You planning on taking a little train ride,
None o' ya?
I don't have to tell you anything.
You're not a cop.
<i>[Siren Wailing In Distance]</i>
<i>Let me give you some advice,</i>
<i>Dylan... Hale.</i>
<i>The next time you want</i>
<i>to pickpocket your dad's wallet...</i>
you might want to make sure
there's some more cash in it.
- He looks like an okay guy.
- He's a jerk.
Most lawyers are.
<i>Clothes. Toothbrush.
I would bet my lottery tickets
you were running away from home.
- Why do you care?
- Because I was never lucky enough to have one.
- Well, that makes two of us.
- [Sighs]
Look, if you're running away from your family,
take my advice. Don't.
<i>Whatever the problem is,</i>
<i>you can work it out... together.</i>
<i>Look, I'm goin'to Atlanta to live with my friends.</i>
<i>That's all the family I need.</i>
That little thief.
Are you gonna let me go
or call the cops?
How about I take you
home instead?
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Wow.</i>
- You live on a boat?
- Yeah.
My dad moved into the harbor a few weeks ago,
after he and my mom split up.
- Where is she now?
- London.
She's, uh, setting up house,
starting a new job.
Look, I'm telling you.
This is a waste of time.
My dad's at the firm.
He's always at the firm.
There's our boat over there.
Hmm.
<i>Looks like somebody's home.</i>
- I can't believe it.
- <i>Is that your dad?</i>
<i>I can't believe he's home.</i>
<i>He's never home.</i>
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent every moment
searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
- <i>[Siren Wailing]</i>
- <i>Nothing.</i>
<i>So, you were saying</i>
<i>about the boat?</i>
Before my dad got busy
with the new firm...
we were fixin' up the boat.
There was thinners, paints...
- <i>all kinds of stuff that could have</i>
<i>blown up on board.</i>
- <i>All right.</i>
We're still trying to reach your mom overseas,
but until then...
I'll arrange for Social Services
to put you up.
Okay?
<i>[Man Sighs]</i>
- There's something you're not telling him.
- [Sighs] Yeah.
We found this tacked up
on the bulletin board.
It's Hale's writing.
A suicide note.
[Sighs]
- Do you mind if I tell him?
- All right.
Excuse me.
Thought we had an agreement, Detective.
I am always the first call.
- Look, I didn't realize this guy was from your firm.
- What have we got?
<i>The divers are in the water, but with</i>
<i>an explosion this size and these currents...</i>
it could take 48 hours
before they find Hale's body.
You make it 36, okay?
- <i>Hale has a son. Where is he?</i>
- Yeah. He was sittin' right over th-
- <i>Find that kid. His father may have</i>
<i>said something to him.</i>
- [Sighs]
Oh, no.
[Broots] And Jarod was long gone, uh,
by the time we got to his desert cabin...
but, um, uh,
this was in the desk drawer.
- <i>Subtext is rather obvious.</i>
- Yeah.
- Parker's conclusion?
- Oh, well, uh-
Miss Parker was unable
to accompany us on the trip.
- Unable?
- She's, uh, sick.
I realize that she's...
cultivated other interests.
Far be it for me to pass judgment...
on somebody consumed
by their passion.
<i>But-</i>
<i>[Sighs]</i>
There are others who won't be
as forgiving as myself...
if she's unable to focus
on her responsibilities.
[Scoffs]
You're gonna make someone
a wonderful wife.
You should see me with a vacuum.
- [Laughs]
- <i>Why aren't you dressed for work?</i>
'Cause it's a beautiful day, and I thought
we'd grab some wine and go out to the-
Parker, you have to talk
to your father.
I know.
Look, if we're ever gonna
have a future together...
you're gonna have to be
honest with him.
It's the only way
you can ever be free.
I know.
I can't live without you.
I don't even want
to think about it, okay?
<i>[Woman On P.A.]</i>
<i>All passengers for the</i> Florida Sun...
<i>the train will be departing</i>
<i>in five minutes from Track "C."</i>
You have to dial 011 first.
- You were calling your mother, weren't you?
- What do you want from me?
The police found a note.
What kind of note?
It was in your father's handwriting.
<i>They don't think that the explosion</i>
<i>on the boat was an accident.</i>
I'm really sorry.
Here's your father's wallet.
- <i>I thought you might like to have it.</i>
- Keep it.
- So you're just gonna run?
- Yeah.
Back to Atlanta
where life made more sense.
Your mother is going to be
coming for you soon.
They said she was away for the weekend.
They keep tryin' to reach her.
Look, I can meet her in Atlanta.
I can't go back to the police.
They'll put me in Social Services,
or worse, a foster home.
Dylan, l- I can't leave you
out here alone.
Where else can I go?
<i>[Rita's Voice] He robs me,</i>
<i>then begs to stay in my extra room?</i>
I don't even want to be here.
Oh, and so polite.
You did say that I brought you
good luck, didn't you?
[Laughs]
Oh, it would be good to hear footsteps...
on these tired floorboards again.
I'm sorry about your father.
Dylan, are you all right?
[Sighs]
Before I left this morning...
I told my dad that I hated him...
<i>that I wished</i>
<i>he would go away forever.</i>
We all say things that
we don't mean sometimes.
[Sighs]
That's the problem.
[Scoffs]
I'm not sure that I didn't.
[Sniffles]
My dad...
was having an affair...
<i>with some woman</i>
<i>named Ashley.</i>
I heard him and my mom
fighting about it.
He was always sneaking off and-
to the pay phone in the marina to call her.
<i>[Sighs]</i>
He didn't even try to deny it.
Then Mom left
to set up the house...
and that's when me and Dad
moved to the boat.
Dylan, who were
the two men on the dock?
They're from my dad's law firm.
The old guy's Edgar Hoyt.
The other one's name is Winston.
He's the head of Security.
He's a bad man, Jarod.
Why do you say that?
About a month ago,
I, uh, heard arguing...
<i>and it was Winston and my dad</i>
<i>on the dock.</i>
<i>He was threatening him, telling him</i>
<i>that he better not cross the firm...</i>
<i>and he had no idea</i>
<i>how powerful they were...</i>
<i>and that he should do the right thing</i>
<i>to protect his family.</i>
<i>Then he slapped my dad</i>
<i>in the face and walked away.</i>
I wish he'd never started
working at that place.
I have to get on the inside.
Now what is it a group of tax attorneys
would fear the most?
Same thing we all fear.
<i>[Woman's Voice]</i>
<i>The Internal Revenue Service.</i>
<i>We're all a little</i>
<i>surprised by your visit.</i>
Well, surprise is what we're all about.
After all, we are the I.R.S.
- Very nice building.
- We're very proud of it.
Mr. Hoyt's office.
He's expecting you.
Thank you.
<i>Mr. Tally. Welcome.</i>
Mr. Hoyt. I hope I'm not here
at an inconvenient time.
- Well, if I said you were, would you leave?
- No, I guess I wouldn't.
- We're a very busy firm.
- I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.
This is Mr. Winston.
He's head of Security.
As I told your assistant...
the service has discovered some irregularities
in your previous year's tax files.
It's nothing serious. We've just changed
the limits on some deductible items...
<i>and it's thrown off your balance sheets.</i>
- How long is this gonna take?
- Well, if I don't find any unforeseen problems...
I should be out of your hair
in, oh, 48 hours.
They've set up an office
for you down the hall.
If there's anything I can do,
you just ask.
I'll do that.
Mr. Hoyt.
Mr. Winston.
[Typing]
[Beeping]
[Beeps]
- <i>[Jarod] Was there any word from his mother?</i>
- <i>[Rita] No.</i>
<i>I thought he'd wear his finger to a nub</i>
<i>dialing it-redialing.</i>
Ah, he's keeping his chin up...
<i>but his eyes can't cover the pain.</i>
[Sighs]
His father?
I got the number off the pay phone
he used to call Ashley.
The other woman.
<i>[Jarod] Now Dylan said</i>
<i>he called her on his mother's birthday.</i>
<i>Phone company records show all the calls</i>
<i>made from that location on that day.</i>
Well, what are we looking for?
The one number that was called a lot
on the previous days.
<i>That must be Ashley's</i>
<i>phone number.</i>
By running the number
through a reverse directory...
<i>we can find out exactly</i>
<i>who this woman is.</i>
- <i>[Rita] So, who's the home-wrecker?</i>
- <i>[Jarod] There wasn't one.</i>
Ashley wasn't a woman.
He was an agent with the F.B.I.
<i>Hale wasn't having an affair.</i>
Then why'd my dad
let my mom leave?
My guess is that he was
trying to protect you.
<i>Pushing you and your mother away was</i>
<i>the only way he knew how to keep you safe.</i>
- Protect us from what?
- Let's find out.
Agent Matthew Ashley, please.
Excuse me.
When?
<i>No. Uh, thank you anyway.</i>
- <i>[Phone Beeps]</i>
- What'd they say?
Agent Ashley is dead.
<i>He was killed in a traffic accident</i>
<i>five days ago.</i>
<i>[Woman's Voice] Ashley never said anything</i>
<i>about working with the D.O.J.</i>
Ashley was investigating a local law firm
the D.O.J. Has its eye on.
Now, I propose that
we marshal our forces.
- <i>Senator Meeks's office is on line two.</i>
- Call him back.
- He's very unhappy.
- Yeah, that makes two of us.
It's quite a zoo
you're running here.
That's what happens when one
of your best people dies unexpectedly.
- Is there any word on what caused the accident?
- There was road construction.
Ashley lost control.
It was a freak thing.
A freak thing?
Ashley had an informant
inside Hoyt and Associates.
<i>This informant was collecting evidence</i>
<i>implicating the firm in the death of a key witness...</i>
set to testify against
one of their major clients.
Does this informant have a name?
He refused to identify himself.
- And the evidence?
- Ashley died before he received it.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Great. It's great.
- Well, I hope you found everything in order.
- So far so good.
Fast and sharp-
A lethal combination.
Well, a corporation in Delaware
kept me on retainer for several years.
It was a scary place,
but I learned a few things along the way.
Oh, one more thing.
I ran into a lot of references to work done
by a man named Peter Hale.
I tried to browse his expense reports,
but I was denied access.
- Well, certain files are "need to know" only.
- Well, I need to know.
- I'll arrange to have those files
delivered immediately.
- <i>Very good.</i>
- If you'll excuse us.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
<i>[Door Closes]</i>
<i>[Beeping]</i>
Hmm.
Even the boss's office.
<i>[Beeps]</i>
<i>Why doesn't that surprise me, Winston?</i>
<i>He's an I.R.S. Grunt.</i>
<i>What's to like?</i>
- I don't know. I have a bad feeling about him.
- Craig, you're paranoid.
<i>You pay me to be paranoid.</i>
<i>The last thing we need...</i>
<i>is somebody asking questions</i>
<i>about Peter Hale.</i>
Hale is dead. Besides, it wasn't me
that got us into this mess.
- <i>It was you.</i>
- <i>Hey, I did what had to be done.</i>
I never suggested murder.
If I hadn't shut those people up,
De Paz would still be sitting in jail.
- <i>How do you think the rest</i>
<i>of the clients would react-</i>
- De Paz.
<i>To the fact that Hoytand Associates</i>
<i>couldn't handle a case like De Paz.</i>
- <i>Getting him out was crucial to the firm's survival.</i>
- Gotcha.
<i>You know that. You also know that a trial</i>
<i>could have ruined us.</i>
<i>Now look, I may have innocent blood</i>
<i>on my hands...</i>
but if I go down, so do you.
Don't ever forget that.
I'll be in my office.
[Beeps]
<i>[Disk Drive Clicking]</i>
<i>Come on.</i> Come <i>on.</i> Come on.
<i>[Clicking Continues]</i>
<i>Come on. Come on. Come on.</i>
<i>Come on.
- Ah, Mr. Winston. I've been looking for you.
- Well, here I am.
I found a few questionable entries
in your expense account deductions...
and I thought maybe after lunch
we could go over them.
- No. We can't.
- I see. Well, I would hate
to bump these up to Collections.
I mean, after all,
a busy man like yourself-
The last thing you need
is an audit.
- Are you threatening me, Mr. Tally?
- I don't have to threaten, sir.
After all, I am the I.R.S.
<i>[Mr. Parker]</i>
<i>Angel. You said it was urgent.</i>
- <i>What is it?</i>
- Daddy, I'm leaving the Centre.
Wh- Leaving?
- <i>This is your home.</i>
- It's the only life you've ever known.
It's the only life
I've been allowed to know.
Ever since I was a little girl,
all I've wanted is to please you.
After Mama died,
it was my sole reason to live.
But I'm not that little girl anymore.
And I won't be needing this.
Uh, this is about
the carpenter, right?
- His name is Thomas, and this is about me.
- <i>[Wheels Squeaking]</i>
Daddy, please.
Please give me your blessing.
<i>[Brigitte]</i>
<i>That doesn't seem fair.</i>
You agreed to stay here
until you captured Jarod.
- Which hasn't yet happened.
- I'm entitled to a life.
<i>Come on. Certainly an organization</i>
<i>as powerful as the Centre...</i>
can replace one individual.
<i>This is much too important</i>
<i>to be decided on a whim.</i>
It's not a whim.
I know what I want.
<i>[Wheels Squeaking]</i>
This is unacceptable.
If you don't stop her, I will.
Don't you ever threaten my family.
Ever.
<i>[Dylan's Voice]</i>
<i>My dad was a hero?</i>
<i>[Dylan's Voice]</i>
<i>My dad was a hero?</i>
<i>He was helping the F.B.I.</i>
<i>Build a case against the firm.</i>
One of their clients was a drug dealer
named Vincent De Paz.
<i>He was facing trial for murder.</i>
Now, the state had an eyewitness-
a woman named Molly Brophy.
- <i>Three days before she was supposed to testify-</i>
- They killed her.
I found these on the Internet.
<i>Winston murdered these people</i>
<i>to protect a client?</i>
I think so.
The trick now is to prove it.
That's why my dad was so afraid.
<i>He must have found out</i>
<i>about the murders.</i>
<i>Dylan, he was trying</i>
<i>to do the right thing.</i>
I miss him, Jarod.
I miss him so much.
I know you do.
[Chattering]
All right, what do you want?
Hale?
You're still alive.
- What have you done with my son?
- Dylan is fine. He's someplace safe.
I saw you leave the waterfront with him.
You work for Hoyt and Winston. Where is Dylan?
My name is Jarod.
I am trying to help you.
- Why should I believe you?
- Because your son does.
And right now, he is scared, and he is confused
because he thinks his father is dead.
[Scoffs] You don't know
what you're gettin' yourself into.
I know about the cover-up
to protect Vincent De Paz.
I know that Molly Brophy
and her granddaughters...
and Agent Ashley
were all murdered.
Now you better talk to me, Peter,
because right now, I'm your last chance.
I stumbled on some irregularities
in an unrelated case.
When I realized what I found,
I contacted the F.B.I.
- Agent Ashley.
- <i>He had me collecting evidence</i>
<i>so the feds could build a case...</i>
<i>even bring down De Paz</i>
<i>and the firm.</i>
And now he's dead.
He had a wife and child.
The F.B.I. Thinks his death
was an accident.
I met with Ashley that morning.
I handed over the evidence on De Paz.
The next thing I know, Ashley's dead-
the files have disappeared.
It was no accident.
It was Winston.
And I was next.
So you staged
your own death.
I panicked.
Winston watches everything.
He knows everything. [Sighs]
I figured the only way out was
if he thought I was dead.
At least that would buy me the time
to get Dylan away from here.
<i>Blowing up the boat was the best idea</i>
<i>I could come up with.</i>
<i>I sealed up the cabin and started filling it</i>
<i>with propane gas.</i>
<i>I called Dylan's school- uh, I was gonna</i>
<i>have him meet me-but he wasn't there.</i>
<i>I started to worry that something</i>
<i>might have already happened to him.</i>
<i>I knew Winston was</i>
<i>having me watched.</i>
<i>Either way, we stood a better chance</i>
<i>ifhe thought I was dead...</i>
<i>so I left the note,</i>
<i>got back on board.</i>
<i>I'd rigged a flare gun</i>
<i>in the cabin.</i>
<i>I grabbed a scuba tank</i>
<i>and slipped into the water.</i>
So, by the time Winston realized
that there was no one on the boat...
you and Dylan would be safe
with your wife in England.
Then when I saw you comin' out of the firm,
I thought I'd lost my boy for good.
Dylan thinks his father is dead.
Oh, God. I've let things get so bad
between the two of us.
But I did it to protect him.
Do you think he'll ever
be able to forgive me?
Why don't we ask him?
<i>[Saw Buzzing]</i>
[Sniffs]
[Inhales, Exhales]
Nothing like the smell
of freshly cut wood.
<i>What's the, uh, spacing code</i>
<i>on those support studs?</i>
Uh, two and a half feet.
These are not more than 18 inches.
That's bad economics.
It'll double the life of the structure.
That's-That's all I care about it.
A man of integrity.
You, uh-You know something
about carpentry.
I know a little
about a lot of things.
<i>Could you, uh-</i> Could you hand me
a bonding clamp, please?
Hmm.
[Grumbles]
[Clears Throat]
I guess you're wondering
why I'm here.
She told you
she wanted to leave.
Your daughter and I don't keep secrets
from each other.
Your tools are old.
You could use some new ones.
- [Laughs]
- Eh?
<i>Can I help you with something,
Mr. Parker?
Hmm.
A blank check?
Fill in any amount you want.
We shake hands,
get on with our lives.
All of us.
I love your daughter,
Mr. Parker.
No amount of money in the world
could ever change that.
- <i>[Jarod] Dylan.</i>
- <i>[Hale] Dylan? Where is he?</i>
<i>You said he'd be here.</i>
Oh, Jarod.
Thank God you came back.
- Where's Dylan?
- <i>[Rita] I tried to stop him...</i>
but he was so angry, so upset.
He took my Otto's pistol.
- Where would he go?
- He's going after Winston.
- <i>[Trigger Clicks]</i>
- Give me that.
- You can't stop me.
- <i>What about me?</i>
Dad?
- I thought you were dead.
- Oh, so did I, when I thought
I wouldn't see you again.
I am sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.
- I saw the boat explode.
- I know.
I know none of this
makes any sense to you...
but I promise I will fix things so they can be
the way they were- the way they should be.
- With Mom too?
- Especially with Mom.
<i>Come on, you two.</i>
<i>We still have a lot of work to do.</i>
It doesn't matter what I do.
They'll never let me go.
I don't understand. You're a grown woman.
<i>Certainly you can make your own decisions.
It's not that simple.
- <i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>
- Who could that be at this hour?
I hope we're not interrupting
anything, angel.
No, we were-
What are you doing here,
Daddy?
Oh, we just stopped by
to make sure you were all right.
- All right?
- Oh, the hell with it.
I wanted to talk to you, sweetheart.
Do you mind if we come in?
Sure.
- Son of a bitch.
- What's wrong?
- Hale's still alive.
- That's impossible.
This is some kind of a scam.
<i>Look at that paper he's holding.</i>
<i>That picture was taken today.</i>
<i>[Scoffs] According to his letter,</i>
<i>it was all a setup.</i>
<i>Hale knows about Molly Brophy</i>
<i>and the F.B.I. Agent.</i>
He wants money to go away.
- What else?
- <i>He wants me to meet him in a parking lot.</i>
He says to come alone
or he tells the F.B.I. The whole story.
- [Sighs]
- What are you going to do?
I'm gonna meet him. Alone.
Then I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch,
once and for all.
[Sighs]
Are you sure I can't get anybody
anything to drink?
No, thank you, Thomas.
- Daddy?
- Hmm?
You wanted to talk to me
about something?
Ah.
I am not young anymore.
- Daddy-
- No, let me finish. I'm a creature of habit.
I don't like changes.
That's just the way I am.
But I've been, um, thinking about you
and your young friend here...
and uh- [Sighs]
Well, I've- I've been selfish.
I don't understand.
The, um, yakuza
have a saying...
that love and fear fly
to heaven on the same wing...
<i>which means the things we do</i>
<i>because we love somebody...</i>
are also the things we do
because we're afraid...
<i>like when Dad tried</i>
<i>to pay Thomas to go away.</i>
What?
Why didn't you tell me that?
Because it wasn't a big deal.
He just-
<i>He made an error in judgment.</i>
<i>That's all.</i>
<i>[Mr. Parker]</i>
<i>One of many, I'm afraid.</i>
Angel, I am terrified.
Of what?
<i>You're all I have-</i>
<i>you and your brother.</i>
If you leave,
I lose probably the best part of me.
But... if you think leaving
is the best for you...
then, uh...
go with my blessing.
- Are you serious?
- I just want you to be happy.
That's all I've ever wanted.
<i>Well, it's late, and, uh,</i>
<i>we have to get up early.</i>
So, uh, good night,
sweetheart.
- Thomas.
- Yeah.
Good night.
Well, congratulations, Parker.
- Looks like you're finally
in control of your own life.
- Yeah.
How does it feel?
- Confusing.
- I'll bet.
Listen, I'm gonna go lock
the back door.
You shut off the lights, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
- [Beeps]
- [Tires Squealing]
<i>[Tire Thumping]</i>
[Sighs]
Damn it.
Damn it!
[Beeping]
[Out-of-service Tones]
<i>Come on!
- Good evening. How may I help you?
- You got a pay phone?
It's on the side of the store,
but it's broken.
Look, I have a flat tire, and I'm late
for a very important meeting...
- so do you think I could use your phone?
- A local call?
[Sighs]
Yes.
<i>This could be some kind of trick.</i>
<i>You might say it's a local call.</i>
<i>Then when the phone bill comes, I see</i>
<i>it's long distance, and I get stuck with the bill.</i>
This is a $20 bill, okay?
So, now, do you think
I could use your phone?
- Make it snappy.
- Thank you so much.
All right, everybody freeze!
This is a robbery!
- All right, lady, out from behind the counter.
- No.
- Don't push me, lady.
Get out from behind the counter!
- You get out from my store.
- Put the gun down, lady!
- Are you crazy? Do what he says.
No more you rob my store.
I fight, or I die.
No, no. You're not gonna fight.
You're gonna lose this one.
- Put the gun down. Let these men walk away.
- <i>Do what he says!</i>
Put the gun down now.
- [Screams]
- What the hell are you doing?
- Man, I panicked. I'm sorry.
- Go check on her!
I didn't see anything.
- Oh, my God. I killed her.
- You stupid idiot!
<i>Sorry, man! Come on.</i>
<i>Let's get out ofhere.</i>
Shut up! Shut up!
Just shut up!
- Let me think for a second.
- I didn't see anything.
<i>Man, you're so stupid!</i>
- All right, get over there! Get over there!
- What are you doing?
You just killed someone, ya idiot!
We can't leave witnesses.
- Wait a minute! You don't have
to kill me. I can help you.
- What are you talkin' about?
Well, you killed somebody!
It's no big deal. It's an accident.
What do you mean it's no big deal?
He just killed an old lady. We could fry for this!
No, no! You're not gonna fry.
You do exactly what I say, and you will walk.
Listen to me. I work for one
of the top law firms in the city, okay?
- You a lawyer? I don't take to lawyers!
- No, no! I'm not a lawyer!
- I'm just like you, all right?
- You are nothin' like me!
Now get down on your knees!
- You never killed nobody!
- I did!
I killed an old lady in a store just like this,
and I walked away. Please!
Please don't kill me.
Please, you gotta believe me.
<i>Please!</i>
I believe you.
You believe him?
- Yeah, I believe him.
- What the hell is this?
- I believe you too.
- <i>[Dylan] So do I.</i>
- <i>[Winston] What is this?</i>
- You forgot one thing.
<i>You also killed</i>
<i>her two granddaughters...</i>
and you killed a federal agent.
- Who the hell are you?
- Somebody...
who's going to turn these tapes
over to the F.B.I.
Now look, I may have innocent blood
on my hands, but if I go down, so do you.
<i>Don't ever forget that.</i>
I killed an old lady in a store just like this,
and I walked away.
<i>Please! Please don't kill me.</i>
<i>Please, you gotta believe me.</i>
<i>Please!</i>
<i>You gotta believe me.</i>
<i>It's kind of a nice ring to it,</i>
<i>don't you think?</i>
- You're a son of a bitch, you know that?
- Oh, relax.
Hey, you never know.
Today... may be your lucky day.
What do you say?
Something like that...
or maybe a really big sailboat?
I don't know, Dad.
Maybe we should live on dry land for a while.
- [Chuckles]
- You know, maybe like a little house?
- Maybe you're right.
- <i>[Jarod] At least you finish what you started.</i>
[Sighs]
I couldn't have done any of it
without you.
Thank you, Jarod.
- So what's next?
- Now I try to put my family back together again.
Well, I think a missing piece
of that puzzle just pulled up.
Mom!
<i>[Rita Laughing, Shouting]</i>
<i>Rita, what's wrong?</i>
It's a miracle!
Lightning just struck
my submarine!
That's great.
<i>[Young Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Tell me about love, Mama.</i>
<i>[Mrs. Parker, Chuckling]</i>
<i>What do you want to know?</i>
<i>Will I ever find someone to love,</i>
<i>like you found Daddy?</i>
- I think you will.
- But how will I know when I'm in love?
Mmm. It's different for everybody.
I used to get light-headed
when your father looked at me.
Was Daddy very handsome?
[Laughs]
Mmm. Handsome, yes.
Beautiful. But don't ever
tell him I said so...
because I certainly
wouldn't want his head to swell.
[Both Laughing]
I hope the man I fall in love with
makes me feel light-headed.
I hope so too, baby.
But until then, you're all mine!
[Giggling]
Mama, when are we-
Mama?
[Echoing]
Mama? Mama?
[Whimpering]
Mama?
Don't leave me.
Mama, don't leave me.
Mama!
[Exhales]
- <i>Come with me.</i>
- Oh, to Oregon?
Why not?
<i>[Shower Running]</i>
Use all the hot water,
and I'll kill you.
<i>Mama, will I ever find someone to love,</i>
<i>like you found Daddy?</i>
I think you will.
I know it isn't easy
living with somebody like me.
I have more baggage
than an airport.
But I want this to work.
I'm committed...
to making you and me work.
So...
if you still want me
to come to Portland with you...
I will.
I want to.
I just poured my guts out...
all over the imported Italian tile.
The least you could give me
is a grunt.
Tommy?
Tommy?
- Thomas.
- [Kicks Bundle]
Oh, my-
Tommy.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Tommy!
<i>Tommy.</i> Can you hear me, baby? Oh, my God.
No, no, no. This isn't happening.
It's okay. I'm here.
It's okay. Oh, my God.
- What are you doin' up there?
- Please! I need help here!
- Police.
- No, wait.
- No, wait! Wait!
- There's been a murder up on Briar Road.
- You don't understand!
- 876.Just send somebody!
- <i>No, I ain't givin'my name.</i>
- Tommy.
<i>Oh, don't leave me.</i>
<i>Please don't leave me.</i>
[Crying]
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent every moment
searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
<i>[Man] How long was it between</i>
<i>the time you found Mr. Gates's body...</i>
<i>and this- this mystery trashman</i>
<i>called 911?</i>
I told you.
It was just a couple of seconds.
You say you never
saw this man before?
Never. He was white,
5'10", 170 pounds.
He had a truck
full of trash and junk.
What color was the truck?
Green. Maybe brown.
Green. Maybe brown.
I did have other things on my mind.
I can imagine.
You sure you don't want a lawyer,
Miss Parker? It is your right.
I have nothing to hide.
- Were you and the victim sleeping together?
- Excuse me?
It's a simple question. Were you
and the deceased having sexual relations?
Tommy and I were
committed to each other.
We were gonna spend
our lives together.
Mm.
Then...
how do you explain
a one-way ticket to Oregon in his jacket?
- <i>Come with me, Parker.</i>
- Oh, to Oregon?
- Why not?
- Well, first of all, I have a career.
Oh, right. Same career
that gave you an ulcer.
I learned a long time ago
the corporate ladder is a dead end.
It's not just the job.
My family?
- You buy a plane ticket. You visit.
- You don't know my family.
Look, it's just not a decision
I can make right now...
here, in my bathrobe.
What are you scared of?
Nothing.
Tommy was planning on
renovating a house...
and... I was planning
on meeting him later.
You know, it's clear
someone broke into my home.
Tommy heard them. He-
He followed them outside
and was shot.
Well, that's-That's one way
it could have happened.
- What other way?
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
Excuse me.
- Do you own a gun, Miss Parker?
- What?
We found this empty holster
in your living room.
- Do you own a firearm, ma'am?
- Yes.
- What kind?
- Smith & Wesson nine-millimeter.
That's a nice piece.
Why would a woman like yourself
need a weapon like that?
I work as a consultant
for an international corporation.
I travel.
It makes me feel safe.
You work out at that-
that complex outside of town, don't you?
- What's it called?
- The Centre.
The Centre.
Well, I've always been curious about
the kind of work you people do out there.
- It's a think tank.
- I'll be damned.
And just what kind of stuff
are you people thinkin' about?
You know, I don't see how this has
anything to do with Thomas's murder.
The preliminary coroner's report says...
<i>that Mr. Gates was killed</i>
<i>by a single gunshot to the head.</i>
<i>The wound appears to have been made</i>
<i>by a nine-millimeter handgun.</i>
<i>And as of now, your weapon</i>
<i>is missing in action.</i>
<i>You positive about that lawyer?</i>
[Broots] Miss Parker,
we're really sorry about Thomas.
He was- I mean, he seemed
like a really nice guy.
This way.
I can't believe you did this.
I meant, let the local authorities
get involved in Centre business.
Look, no disrespect intended...
but we both know the danger
of exposing the Centre to outsiders.
It wasn't my decision.
Someone else called the police.
- Who?
- A trashman.
He was outside my house-
I'm sorry you had
to go through this alone.
- <i>Did you find my father?</i>
- He was in Montreal on business.
He caught the first plane home.
He should be on the ground as we speak.
Parker, can we get you something?
I want Tommy back.
<i>[Man On TV] Our own Ken Johnson</i>
<i>will have tomorrow's weather forecast...</i>
<i>coming up later in the 10.00 hour.</i>
<i>We now switch to Kate Scofield with a report</i>
<i>on an incident from earlier today.</i>
<i>[Woman] Our News 17 was on the scene</i>
<i>of an apparent homicide...</i>
<i>in the exclusive community</i>
<i>of Blue Cove.</i>
<i>Details are sketchy, but what we know is</i>
<i>there was an apparent robbery attempt...</i>
that ended in the death
of a 36-year-old white male...
identified as Thomas Gates.
<i>The owner of the house</i>
<i>has yet to be identified.</i>
Also, police have not confirmed
any eyewitnesses to the crime...
and have told us that the investigation
will continue throughout the night.
We hope to have more details on tonight's
news at 11:00. Back to you, Matt.
[Crying]
Honey, have you seen
my red flannel shirt?
<i>I need more information.</i>
Uh, red, flannel.
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- [Laughing]
You're always wearing my shirts.
How come?
'Cause they smell like you.
- I like that.
- <i>Mmm.</i>
Well, I need something
to wear to work.
So, take it...
if you think you're man enough.
[Laughing]
I'll tell you what.
I will make you a deal.
- I'm open for negotiations.
- Yeah?
When I die,
I'll leave you all my shirts, okay?
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Don't worry.
I'm not goin' anywhere.
Okay?
Hmm?
<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
<i>[Ringing Continues]</i>
[Sighing, Sniffling]
- Hello.
- I saw the news report about Thomas.
Are you okay?
- It's too soon to tell.
- They said it was an unsolved homicide.
- Do the police have any suspects?
- One.
If you include me.
You must be close if you
saw the local report on television.
Always the hunter, Miss Parker.
I barely have enough...
energy to sleep...
let alone chase you around.
I appreciate the call, Jarod. But, if you
don't mind, I have a lot to think about.
Like finding out who did this.
You might want to take a closer look
at the people around you.
And what exactly am I looking for?
Missing pieces, Miss Parker.
Missing pieces.
[Beeps]
<i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>
[Sighs]
Angel, we came
as soon as we could.
<i>Chinese tea
with lemon and honey.
- The way you liked when you were little.
- Maybe later, Daddy.
Oh. Uh, you betcha.
You can't imagine the shock
when we heard the news.
<i>And then to find out</i>
<i>that the local police got involved.</i>
I explained that.
Right, right.
The mysterious trashman.
Lyle says it looks like
a screwed-up robbery.
- It looks that way.
- You don't believe that?
There's still some...
missing pieces to put together.
I find it hard to believe
that somebody breaks into your house...
<i>rifles through your drawers...</i>
<i>then shoots your lover point-blank</i>
<i>in the head, and you don't hear a sound.</i>
The shock took away her edge.
It happens.
To a trained professional?
You got something to say, lady?
Say it.
Emotions are making you soft.
What would you know about emotions?
At least I know how
to protect the ones I love.
At least I know how
to protect the ones I love.
- That's enough.
- That's right.
The Triumvirate says "Jump."
And you say, "On who?"
- <i>I said that's enough!</i>
- [Knocking]
Detective Miller.
- Always nice to have family in a time of need.
- What can I do for you?
Thought you might like to know
we caught a man about a mile from here.
- A man?
- He was carrying
a nine-millimeter Smith & Wesson...
and was covered in blood-
Thomas Gates's blood.
- <i>[Miller] His name's Wade Dawson.</i>
- He has a criminal record?
<i>Goin'back to his teens.</i>
<i>Dawson's a small-time drug dealer-</i>
street-corner stuff.
I've busted him half a dozen times
for B & E myself.
When we picked him up,
he had this in his backpack.
- My gun.
- <i>Dawson claims he's never seen it before.</i>
Truth is, he was so wasted when we found him,
he barely knew his own name.
- You said he had Thomas's blood on him.
- That's right.
The same as on the gun.
There's something else
you should know, Miss Parker.
When we went through Dawson's stuff,
we found these.
- He was watching us?
- <i>Dawson was probablyjust out for a thrill.</i>
Then he saw the opportunity
to rob your place, and Gates-
Thomas was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.
<i>[On Speaker]</i>
<i>Look, man, I'm tryin'to cooperate.</i>
- <i>Just tell me what you want to know.</i>
- Good.
- <i>What do you want to know?</i>
- Okay.
Tell me again
about the woman in the pictures.
I didn't draw no pictures, man.
Do you think you could, uh-
<i>You think you could</i>
<i>hook a brother up with a little...</i>
situation in a-
[Muttering]
- You know what I mean?
- When was the last time you fixed?
Um, an hour.
I mean- I mean, a year.
Listen, man, I'll tell you
whatever you need to know in here...
if you, um, just help me out
just a little bit, you know.
'Cause I can't go from
grade "A"juice, man, to nothing.
Okay? 'Cause it's not human.
- I'll tell you what.
- Hmm?
You tell me
about that guy you popped.
- Aw!
- I'll see what I can do.
Popped? I didn't pop no guy.
You got the wrong man, man.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- The murder weapon was found in your backpack.
- [Murmuring]
You had the victim's blood
all over your coat.
You listen to me.
Now you either start working with me...
or I swear to God you will spend
the rest of your life in prison.
- Can I ask you something, man?
- What?
Do you think that they have the...
Playboy Channel up there in prison?
[Laughing]
- You son of a bitch.
- Miss Parker. No!
I'll kill you myself!
Get her off me!
- Get off him!
- Tell the truth, you bastard!
- [All Shouting]
- She's crazy, man!
Help me up!
Get her away from me!
- <i>[Man] Get her outta there!</i>
- Tell the truth! Tell the truth!
- <i>[Detective] All right, all right, all right.</i>
- <i>She's crazy, man.</i>
[Sobbing]
<i>[Bell Tolling]</i>
<i>[Minister] As we grieve, we must</i>
<i>remember that death is not the end...</i>
but the beginning.
And so we commit the body
ofThomas Gates to the earth...
<i>and release his soul to heaven.</i>
May his Heavenly Father
hold him...
and love him for eternity.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Thomas didn't have any family.
His parents died
when he was in college.
So it's- It's my honor
to say a few things about him.
[Voice Breaks]
Tommy-
He was a-
He was a good man, caring man.
In the short time I knew him,
I never ceased to be amazed...
by the unselfish way
he lived his life.
He didn't have
many material possessions.
<i>He used to say</i>
<i>we don't own material things...</i>
that they own us.
<i>But he was rich</i>
<i>in so many other ways...</i>
<i>in ways that only</i>
<i>a loving human being can be.</i>
He saw the best in people,
and he embraced it.
He made people feel special, like-
like they were the most important
person in his life.
I wish I would've met you
when I was a little boy.
And why is that?
Because my whole life-
everything that I've ever done or felt
up until this moment-
was wasted...
because you weren't a part of it.
I love you, Parker.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>I will think ofhim often.</i>
And I will love him forever.
Sweet dreams, my love.
<i>[Woman Singing Ballad]</i>
<i>[Continues]</i>
- <i>[Ends]</i>
- Is there anything else I can get you?
Another round and-
and a time machine.
Actually, I was thinking
more along the lines of a cup of coffee...
and a cab.
[Laughing]
- What's so funny?
- This.
You and me.
I spend 80% of my life hunting you...
and the second I stop,
you sit down in my lap.
I guess, as much as we'd
both like to deny it...
we're both just two pieces
of the same puzzle.
And quite a grotesque little puzzle
it's turned out to be.
[Sighs]
Have a drink with me, Jarod,
while I'm still buyin'.
Another round here for me and-
<i>Oh, come on, good buddy, Jarod.</i>
Boy Genius.
[Laughing]
I realize you're in pain...
and I'm very sorry
for what has happened.
But if you're going to find out
who really killed Thomas...
you're going to have
to keep your wits about you.
See? You're not so smart after all.
'Cause they caught the guy,
so there are no more missing pieces.
They just need to get him
to spill his guts...
and then we all...
live happily ever after.
Listen to me.
Their suspect isn't going to talk.
What do you mean?
The man the police
think killed Thomas Gates...
died of a drug overdose in his cell
less than one hour ago.
Missing pieces, Miss Parker.
Missing pieces.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Look at the positive side.</i>
At least you don't have to go through
the pain of a trial.
[Clears Throat]
Don't you get it?
Dawson ended this on his terms.
I wanted to look him in the eye
when they sentenced him to death...
to have... my face be the last thing he saw
before he was sent to hell.
[Moans]
- I think you should speak
to someone about this feeling.
- You mean a shrink, don't you?
Thanks, Syd, but I'll leave
the mental masturbation to someone else.
[Chattering]
- What I need now are answers.
- What sort of answers?
Dawson's a lifelong junkie.
He takes drugs like we breathe air.
And then suddenly- Suddenly
he overdoses while in police custody?
Mm-hmm. What next?
Miller told me Dawson lived in a shed
down by the railroad tracks.
- <i>You're not gonna go snooping</i>
<i>around his place, are you?</i>
- No.
<i>We're</i> gonna go snoopin'
around his place.
<i>[Flies Buzzing]</i>
[Gasps]
Oh, man.
It smells like a toilet in here,
Miss Parker.
Oh.
There was some pretty sick stuff
going on in here.
<i>Unorthodox lifestyle.</i>
[Broots] How can a human being
live in a place like this?
Whatever lived here was no human.
Syd.
- <i>What is it?</i>
- Pharmaceutical-grade morphine.
Hundred-percent pure.
Here's some more.
Detective Miller said Dawson
was a two-bit hustler, a sidewalk dealer.
- So?
- So the kind of drugs that we're looking at...
are next to impossible
to find on the street.
Look at this place.
Dawson slept in his own filth.
There's no way he'd know
where to score this stuff.
- He had a supplier.
- One with powerful connections.
Broots, I want you to take
these vials back to the Centre.
- See if you can blow any prints off them.
- Okay.
I'm outta here.
What are you looking for,
Miss Parker?
The missing pieces.
You never talk about her.
She was my whole life.
It's a long story.
My folks died when I was 20.
Yeah, I was so... angry.
I just... walked away.
Now I don't have any photos of them.
I wish now that I did.
It's just a picture.
It does make me feel connected to her,
like she's protecting me.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, baby.
Miss Parker? Excuse me.
- I finished checking the drug vials for prints.
- And?
Other than Dawson, the only thing
I could get was a smudged partial.
- Any chance of isolating it?
- Um, no. I'm afraid not.
I'm sorry.
Hey, Broots. Thank you.
<i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>
[Sighs]
What?
<i>It feels like the big picture</i>
<i>is beginning to come into focus.</i>
Then why do I feel so blind?
- What did you find at Wade Dawson's place?
- How'd you know we went?
- What did you find?
- A zoo no animal would live in.
- Is that all?
- There were drug vials.
Pharmaceutical-grade narcotics.
- Morphine.
- That's right.
Jarod, what are you
trying to tell me?
That Wade Dawson was murdered.
The autopsy showed morphine in his blood.
He O.D.'d.
The police told me that.
There were also traces of strychnine-
fatal traces.
There were also traces of strychnine-
fatal traces.
They killed him before he could talk.
Jarod, how could you
possibly know this?
I have a close contact on the inside.
Remember, Miss Parker.
- Missing pieces.
- [Phone Beeps]
Jarod, don't hang up. Jarod.
[Sighs]
Damn it.
<i>Annoying, isn't it, Miss Parker?</i>
He has a habit of disappearing
in the middle of a conversation.
Jarod says that Dawson was murdered.
- <i>By whom?</i>
- He didn't say.
Your boy's really starting
to piss me off.
- <i>Where are you going?</i>
- L- I set up a meeting with Detective Miller.
He's gonna meet me
at my house in 20 minutes.
What makes you believe
you can trust him?

Ronald Miller- 23 years on the force,
six meritorious citations.
He's got four kids, and he's still married
to his high school sweetheart.
<i>From where I stand, he's the only</i>
<i>person in this entire situation...</i>
who doesn't have an agenda.
<i>[Machine Grinding]</i>
<i>[People Chattering]</i>
<i>[Chatter On Police Radio]</i>
- What happened?
- Some guy lost it on the curve.
<i>Pulled a kamikaze into the tree.</i>
They know who it is?
I didn't get a name, but
the tow truck driver said he was a cop.
[Gasps]
<i>[Jarod's Voice]</i>
<i>Missing pieces, Miss Parker.</i>
<i>Missing pieces.</i>
<i>The true casualties of war</i>
<i>are always the innocent.</i>
War. Is that what this is?
He had four children and a wife.
I just...
can't help but feel responsible.
We're all responsible.
But not for this.
This is the brake line
from Miller's car.
It was cut deliberately.
- Someone sabotaged it?
- Ron Miller was a good cop.
He was just trying to find the truth
behind Thomas's murder.
That's why he and Dawson
were silenced. So that-
So that no tracks could
lead back to the Centre.
That is what they do.
They kill anyone
who's remotely interested in the truth.
<i>Then they take away the people</i>
<i>that we love the most.</i>
Why?
To control us,
to use us to do their dirty work.
For me, it was my parents
and my brother.
And you-
your mother and now Thomas.
<i>You ever wonder</i>
<i>how a man in prison...</i>
<i>got his hands on</i>
<i>pharmaceutical-grade morphine?</i>
I do.
- How do I stop them?
- With the truth.
Missing pieces.
<i>[Cell Phone Beeping]</i>
- [Line Rings]
- Broots, I need you to do something for me.
Luckily, the Blue Cove Police...
use the same monitoring equipment
that we do.
I was able to hack
into the tape archives...
and copy the video footage
of the prisoner-surveillance area.
Skip the tram ride. Did Wade Dawson
have contact with anyone...
during the time he was locked up?
Just one person.
[No Audible Dialogue]
- I can't see his face.
- Other camera angles?
None. But he turns slightly
towards the lens as he gets up to leave.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>That has to be the poisoned drugs.</i>
Dawson must have used
chewing gum or glue...
to make it stick
to the bottom of his boot.
- What about the mystery man?
- Oh, he's comin' up.
<i>Wait. Go back. Go back.</i>
<i>Freeze there.</i>
<i>[Distorted]</i>
<i>There's been a murder up on Briar Road.</i>
- The trashman.
- Who?
That's the same man
that was outside my house.
Run a check on him. I wanna know
who that is and where I can find him.
Missing pieces.
Howdy, folks.
How can we help you today?
We're looking for someone.
We think he may be working here.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Look familiar?</i>
Why y'all lookin' for this fella?
Oh, we represent
a trust account, and, uh...
we have reasons to believe the man
in the picture is owed a large sum of money.
- [Laughing] Unlucky Lester hit the jackpot?
- Quite possible.
- Where can we find unlucky Lester?
- He's right in the back.
Mm.
- <i>[People Laughing]</i>
- Lester.
- Lester.
- Who wants to know?
We need to talk to you.
I'm kind of busy right now.
I just- Uh!
Give me another reason
to shoot you.
- Wh-What do you want?
- Remember me?
[Stammers]
No. No.
Sydney, step back. I wouldn't want you
to get brain matter all over your new suit.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I only did what the guy asked me to do.
I thought it was a prank.
Get up.
Get up!
- Who told you to come to my house that morning?
- I don't know.
It was just a voice on the phone.
He offered me a thousand dollars
to be in the woods that morning.
<i>He said all I had to do</i>
<i>was call the cops and take off.</i>
I swear. I swear.
L- I thought it was a stunt.
Does that include passing drugs to people
while they're in jail?
- I needed the money.
- I'll bet you did.
- What about Miller?
- Who?
The cop whose car you sabotaged.
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- [Chuckles]
You're lyin', and you're dyin'.
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Trashman's our only link to Thomas's killer.
<i>Dead, he'll be of no further help.</i>
[Exhales] Do you think you could
recognize his voice if you heard it again?
Yeah. Uh, I guess.
Uh, but, uh-
That'll-That'll cost ya.
- Go on.
- Well, whoever this guy is...
he's not real fond of leavin' loose ends,
if you know what I mean.
- What do you want?
- Uh-
Uh, four-
five... hundred thousand dollars.
That's the deal. You take it or...
shoot me right here.
Either way, I'm finished.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Dawson was framed.</i>
They planted my gun on him and pumped him
so full of pure morphine that even he...
wasn't sure if he pulled
the trigger or not.
Daddy, don't you see?
This man at the garage
is the only person...
who can identify Thomas's killer.
Half a million dollars
is a lot of money.
I'd pay 10 times that
if I thought it'd ease your pain.
If the Centre is involved,
we have to keep it internal.
- No outside <i>agencies.</i> Clear?
- Crystal.
You go find him, bring him back.
It's time we ended this mess
once and for all.
<i>[Engine Idling Quietly]</i>
- [Shakes Doorknob]
- Door's locked.
<i>Hello?</i>
Stay behind me.
Lester.
Broots, give me the flashlight.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>What's that noise?</i>
<i>[Coughs]</i>
<i>The car's running.</i>
Oh, my God.
Broots, kill the engine!
The door's locked.
The window's closed.
[Miss Parker] Out of the way.
Hold this. Back off. Give me some light.
- [Sydney] He's gone.
- Let's get out of here.
[Gasps]
Daddy. What are you doing here?
<i>It was my idea.</i>
<i>When I heard what you were up to...</i>
we were concerned for your safety,
so we followed you.
<i>It's a dangerous world, little lady.</i>
- Can't be too careful.
- She's right.
These people are nothin' but scum.
They'd kill you soon as look at you.
Daddy, this man was the last link
in proving who killed Thomas.
<i>Well, this breaks the chain for good.</i>
Get a Cleaner team in here. I don't want
any trace of Centre involvement.
Yes, sir.
- <i>[Lyle On Cell Phone, Indistinct]</i>
- That's it?
That's all you're gonna do?
Ah. I know how hard it is
to lose somebody you love.
Stop searching for fixes,
answers that may not exist.
The only way to survive
is to get on with the business of living.
Sorry, angel.
Ah, it's a hell of a thing.
<i>[Woman Vocalizing, Ethereal]</i>
<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- [Softly] What?
- You spend way too much time
in cemeteries, Miss Parker.
They killed them all,
and for what?
Power? Control?
- What will you do now?
- [Sighs]
I'm going to grieve.
I'm gonna stand here and remember
all the good things I had.
And then?
I'm gonna wait until they
think it's all... forgotten...
find out who did this
and make them pay.
Look under the tree next to you.
<i>I left you a little present.</i>
Don't stop searching
for those missing pieces, Miss Parker.
If you do, you'll never find
what you're looking for.
- [Beeps]
- <i>[Beeps]</i>
<i>[Woman Singing Ballad]</i>
Tell me about love, Mama.
What do you want to know?
Will I ever find someone to love,
like you found Daddy?
I think you will.
<i>[Continues]</i>
<i>[Ends]</i>
<i>[Thomas's Voice]</i>
<i>I love you, Parker.</i>
<i>[Train Whistle, Distant]</i>
<i>[Footsteps]</i>
[Laughs] I got you,
you self-righteous son of a-
<i>[Gunfire]</i>
[Grunts]
- Ah, ah, ah!
- [Cries Out]
- Don't mess with me, Detective,
especially with this gun.
- <i>[Gun Cocks]</i>
It's a.44 Magnum.
I saw a guy in a movie use one once.
Highly effective.
What you gonna do, Jarod?
Shoot your own partner?
Why not?
You shot yours.
Detective Santora
knew too much, didn't he?
About your kickbacks
from the Eighth Avenue dealers.
About your private stash of heroin,
courtesy of the evidence locker.
You're an addict,
Detective.
Your partner found out,
so you killed him.
Oh. Like I'm gonna do you.
[Laughs]
You fired six shots, you moron.
And, oh, by the way,
you were right about Santora.
If he wouldn't have been
such an overachiever...
I wouldn't have had
to shoot him between the eyes.
You ever seen
that in a movie?
No. But I saw that
in a cartoon.
Gotcha.
- [Beeping]
- <i>[Heavy Metal]</i>
<i>[Continues]</i>
<i>[Typing]</i>
<i>"Another game, Joshua?"</i>
<i>"You're on, Bryce.</i>
<i>How about face-to-face?"</i>
<i>I knew you'd come.</i>
- Man-to-man.
- Joshua?
- <i>You look surprised.</i>
- You said you were in the eighth grade.
I was- [Chuckles]
A long time ago.
<i>Your daddy should have taught you</i>
<i>to never trust strangers on the Internet.</i>
- I thought you were my friend.
- I'm better than that, kid.
<i>Much better.</i>
<i>I'm your brother.</i>
<i>Help! No! Let me go!</i>
<i>Let me go!</i>
<i>Let me go!</i>
[Engine Starts]
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>
[Beeping]
<i>[Man] Good work, Doyle.</i>
<i>Maybe there's some dirty cops...</i>
<i>in Minnesota you</i>
<i>can take care of.</i>
Never seen a cop transfer in and out
as fast as you did, Doyle.
I have a very short
attention span, sir.
- Minneapolis is lucky to have you.
- Thank you.
- This your family?
- <i>Uh, yes.</i>
I hope to update
those photographs soon.
- Haven't seen 'em in a while, hmm?
- No, sir.
- <i>[Woman On Radio] This is Dispatch. Over.</i>
- Go ahead, Dispatch.
Decatur Division
reported a 207.
Thirteen-year-old boy
residing at 439 Oakbrook Road.
A kidnapping?
This is Detective Doyle.
- I'm rolling to the scene.
- What about Minneapolis?
- I have to do this.
- Why?
I have a thing
about kidnappings.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent every moment
searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
[Police Radio Chatter]
<i>[Siren Blaring, Distant]</i>
I'm Detective Doyle.
What have we got?
What we got is what we don't have.
Namely, her son...
<i>Bryce Banks.</i>
Thirteen, straight-A student,
captain of the chess club.
<i>Mom goes in last night about 10.30,</i>
<i>kisses him good night.</i>
Wakes up this morning,
and he's gone.
<i>His father is</i>
<i>a strict disciplinarian.</i>
<i>Mom's just a mom.</i>
<i>She's pretty shaken up.</i>
I don't even want to imagine what these
people are goin' through right now.
<i>They took Jarod!</i>
<i>My son!</i>
Where is he? Where is he?
Detective? Detective?
Hmm?
- Are you with me, Doyle?
- I'm with you.
Daddy, I got your message.
- Everything all right?
- Angel, I need your help.
- My help?
- It's Brigitte.
- Oh.
- <i>Look...</i>
I know how hard it's been
for you since Thomas's death.
I'd really just
rather... move on.
That's what I'm tryin' to do-
move on, make my marriage work.
But Brigitte? I don't know
what the hell's going on.
I mean, this erratic behavior,
mood swings-
She changed
her hair color again.
<i>This morning I found her</i>
<i>crying in the shower, for God's sake.</i>
Daddy, I don't see
how I can be of any help.
Well, reach out to her,
woman-to-woman.
<i>I mean, relate to her,</i>
<i>find out what's bothering her.</i>
Daddy, Bridget and I
aren't exactly bosom buddies.
Angel, please.
Remember,
she's family now, hmm?
- <i>[Police Radio Chatter]</i>
- <i>[Men Chattering]</i>
<i>[Detective] The kid's a prodigy.</i>
<i>When it comes to chess...</i>
<i>Bryce Banks is the Michael Jordan</i>
<i>of the checkerboard.</i>
- <i>Can you tell me what happened?</i>
- <i>[Jarod] I don't think your son was taken.</i>
At least not from here.
There are no signs of a struggle.
And the only fingerprints
on this open window are your son's.
- Bryce would never run away.
- Are you sure?
There's something else,
isn't there?
He slammed this down
before he left.
He slammed it down
because of the tournament.
Bryce was supposed to compete
in the City Chess Final on Saturday...
<i>but he wanted to go skateboarding</i>
<i>with his friends...</i>
and Philip
wouldn't let him.
- You had an argument.
- I worked my tail off for that kid.
- He never appreciated it.
- Oh, God!
- It's true.
- Bryce is gone, and we don't know where.
- Can't that wait?
- <i>[Jarod] When you came in to say good night...</i>
<i>did you notice anything strange</i>
<i>about the way your son was acting?</i>
I could see how disappointed
he was, missing the trip with his friends.
But before I left,
he was back on the computer.
- <i>[Typing]</i>
- <i>[Jarod] He traded e-mails</i>
<i>with somebody named Joshua.</i>
<i>They arranged to meet</i>
<i>for the first time last night...</i>
face-to-face, to play chess.
<i>[Mrs. Banks]</i>
<i>Could Joshua be the kidnapper?</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>We're going to find out.</i>
<i>[Detective's Voice] There was a report</i>
<i>of a bomb exploding here around 12.05.</i>
What's with the explosives?
Looks like the kidnapper
wanted to destroy all evidence.
He used a highly flammable explosive...
like napalm.
That seems like overkill.
Why not just grab the kid
and be done with it?
That's a good question.
<i>Which leaves us right back</i>
<i>in the dark.</i>
In the e-mails, the kidnapper
asked Bryce to meet him here.
<i>How did they both know</i>
<i>this place?</i>
[Detective]
<i>Chess tournament. Statewide event.
<i>Covers players from
all over the southeast.
[Jarod]
And it's open to the public.
Yeah. Maybe the guy's some
crazed kiddie chess fan or something.
Uh-uh.
It runs deeper than that.
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>You never let me play games.</i>
Mr. Raines, I don't understand.
When you're the best
at what you do, Jarod...
people stand up and notice.
The kidnapper wants Bryce
because he's the best.
He covets the superior mind.
<i>Yes, Father. Yes, sir.</i>
He'll be ready
when the time comes.
What are you gonna do to me?
I'm going
to give you immortality.
<i>What's that for?</i>
It's for you, Joshua.
I want to see my mom and dad.
I told you, Joshua.
You have a new father now.
- My name's Bryce!
- Your name is Joshua, just like me!
Y-You can't understand.
But you're brilliant.
You'll learn.
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Because you're special.
My people have talked to everybody
involved with the chess tournament...
- and come up with zero.
- Well, they missed something.
The tournament was the only place that the
kidnapper could have watched Bryce perform.
<i>The boy's a prodigy,</i>
<i>the ultimate trophy.</i>
<i>You may be right about that,</i>
<i>Detective.</i>
<i>Uh, Jarod, this is Samantha Waters,</i>
<i>the F.B.I. 's top profiler.</i>
<i>I'm with the Violent Crimes</i>
<i>Task Force here in Atlanta.</i>
Violent Crimes?
But this is a kidnapping.
Well, it may be more than that,
Detective. A lot more.
Your kidnapper's M.O. Matches
that of a man...
who abducted eight boys in Maryland
and Virginia in the late 1980s.
We got a red flag related to
the previous unsolved case files.
The last three boys were taken
within weeks of each other in 1989.
Uh, Michael Taylor,
Theodore Reed and Harry Dunn.
"Each victim was between 11
and 13 years of age.
Each displayed
accelerated intelligence."
<i>"Trace evidence destroyed at the scene</i>
<i>with a highly flammable explosive. "
- This sounds like our guy.
- Were any of these boys found?
Yeah, we found six of the boys,
but they'd been killed.
Two of them are still missing-
Michael Taylor and Theodore Reed.
Harry Dunn
was the last boy taken.
[Sighs]
Your conclusion?
<i>Sam?</i>
These children,
they may not be trophies.
They... may be subjects.
It's almost as if the kidnapper's
putting them through...
some sort of
testing procedure...
and weeding out the weak
and rejecting them.
By dumping them in the woods.
How is it going
on locating the Banks boy?
The C.I.D. Was able to isolate
a partial shoe print...
outside the blast area-
size 12.
<i>By the indentation, I could guess he was</i>
<i>about 6 foot 2, 200 pounds.</i>
<i>By the indentation, I could guess he was</i>
<i>about 6 foot 2, 200 pounds.</i>
Well, I don't think that this guy
relies on physical size to intimidate.
I think that this is all about
emotional control.
His screen name was Joshua.
He traded e-mails with Bryce
before Bryce vanished.
All right. Well, I'll go
over everything in detail...
<i>and hopefully I'll be able to come up with</i>
<i>a more complete profile for you.</i>
- May I ask you one more thing?
- Of course you can.
The last boy that was kidnapped-
the boy in the photograph-
How long was he held
before he was killed?
Seventy-two hours.
Maybe less.
Hello? Bridget?
- <i>Brigitte?</i>
- <i>[Sobbing]</i>
<i>[Sobbing Continues]</i>
<i>[Miss Parker's Voice]</i>
<i>The woman is a junkie.</i>
- What are you gonna tell your father?
- The truth. What else?
It will be your word
against Bridget's.
- <i>I'll get proof.</i>
- How're you gonna do that?
Would you like one?
- I haven't seen one of these in a while.
- They're very good.
Thank you.
- "Invisible."
- Invisible?
That's how Bryce refers
to himself in these e-mails.
He said that his father pushed him
so hard, he felt as if he didn't exist.
The other victims had similar
relationships with their parents...
specifically their fathers.
So, they all suffered deep psychological wounds
caused by strained parental relationships.
<i>They were all emotionally</i>
<i>cut off from them.</i>
Vulnerable.
<i>Jarod?</i>
I don't think you ever get used
to seeing things like that.
<i>A lot of cops I know grow cold</i>
<i>to it out of necessity.</i>
I wish I could figure out how.
What-What is this?
Some kind of shorthand or-
Oh. It's, uh- It's nothing.
<i>It's just something I made up</i>
<i>as a child to...</i>
keep the wrong people
from reading my diary.
I think that Bryce wanted
his privacy too...
<i>but his father</i>
<i>wouldn't let him have it.</i>
I think that his father wanted him to be
something that he never was or ever could be-
a star.
<i>[Mr. Banks's Voice] This is ridiculous. You're</i>
<i>saying the kidnapper was at the tournament?</i>
- This is pathetic.
- Philip-
- <i>No!</i>
I'm not gonna stand by while
the police chase dead ends.
He hasn't even made
a ransom demand yet.
He may not.
You think this man might kill
our son no matter what we do?
The kidnapper may have been
stalking your son at the tournament.
<i>Now can you remember anyone</i>
<i>who paid particular attention to Bryce?</i>
- Uh, a teacher, a tutor, anybody?
- I taught my son chess.
There was that journalist at
the season's first tournament.
I don't remember his name,
but I remember thinking he was strange.
- Strange how?
- He said he was gonna do a feature on Bryce.
But he hadn't even made it
to the city finals yet.
You think he
could've taken my son?
We'll see what
we can track down.
Well, somebody better
start doin' something.
Detectives, wait, please.
About the way my husband
is acting-
We-We understand he's
under a lot of pressure.
[Scoffs]
That's no excuse.
My son thinks he's
invisible to his father.
We need another chance
to make this right.
Please, please, find my son.
- Hey, anything new?
- Nothing so far.
I've got George cross-referencing
the Banks kid with all the missing boys.
Friends, schools,
the whole nine yards.
Now, except for the fact they could all be
in Mensa, there's no other connection.
We're going through it, Sam,
but the process is slow.
- Yeah, I know.
- You okay?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm, uh-
I'm working with this detective.
His name is Doyle.
Jarod Doyle.
- He's good. It's just-
- But what?
I don't know. It's just-
I'm tired. It's this case- these kids.
- Be careful, Sam.
- I will. Bye-bye.
Hello?
I must be crazy.
<i>[Brigitte] Ooh, goody!</i>
<i>There's nobody home.</i>
- <i>[Man Chuckling]</i>
- <i>You are so naughty!</i>
<i>[Laughing]</i>
<i>Mmm!</i>
I know I shouldn't
do this, but...
sometimes a girl has to do
what a girl has to do.
- <i>[Laughing]</i>
- A nooner?
It's not even 11:00.
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
What?
You gotta help me. There's some
pretty freaky things going on here.
- Broots, where are you?
- I'm stuck in your father's bathroom.
And there's some things goin' on here that
shouldn't be goin' on in the workplace.
What the hell are you
talking about?
I'm talking about Brigitte.
<i>[Brigitte]</i>
<i>Oh, you'd better go clean that up...</i>
before it stains your pants,
you know.
Oh- Oh, l-I gotta go.
Broots? Broots?
<i>[Brigitte] Hurry up. It's kind ofhard</i>
<i>to finish this without you.</i>
If your husband finds us in his office,
we'll both be finished.
[Sighs]
<i>[Car Doors Closing]</i>
<i>[Jarod] The reporter Bryce's Mom</i>
<i>mentioned is named Joshua Meyers.</i>
- So what's the problem?
- The problem is...
the magazine he claims
to write for doesn't exist.
[Detective] From the looks of this place,
neither does his career.
Meyers?
Oh, my God.
<i>[Detective] Whoever he is,</i>
<i>this guy built a shrine to Bryce Banks.</i>
Our guy?
But where's the boy?
<i>[Running Footsteps]</i>
- [Rifle Cocks]
- Get down!
<i>Come out!
<i>[Yelling]</i>
I thought you said
the kidnapper was a big guy.
This guy couldn't
be more than 5'6".
- Where's the boy?
- Y-
You're too late.
He's my brother now.
You have pictures of Bryce Banks
all over your walls.
- What have you done with him?
- His name's Joshua.
He's my brother now.
[Man Screaming, Static]
<i>[Screaming, Static Stops]</i>
So, little brother,
tell me your name.
My name is Joshua.
My name is Joshua.

<i>[Sam]</i>
<i>I've been going over the case files...</i>
- <i>and I think there may be two kidnappers.</i>
- [No Audible Dialogue]
Joshua Meyers.
His real name is Theodore Reed.
<i>One of the kidnapped boys</i>
<i>that the bureau never found.</i>
<i>[Detective]</i>
<i>How could that be possible?</i>
- <i>He grew up.</i>
- My name is Joshua.
<i>My name is Joshua.</i>
<i>My name is Joshua.</i>
<i>My name is Joshua.</i>
My name is Joshua!
[Echoing]
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Well-[Clears Throat]</i>
<i>I've got good news,</i>
<i>and I've got bad news.</i>
The good news is
Brigitte is a lot happier.
And the bad news is it's Mr. Lyle
who's making her that way.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about
the horizontal bop.
- Bridget and my brother?
- Broots, are you 100% sure?
Oh, well,
more like 80, 82.
What? Drugs and Lyle?
Unbelievable.
[Sighs]
This is gonna break
my father's heart.
[Jarod]
They've been gone for a decade...
and now they kidnap
other children.
A human pyramid scheme.
So the second kidnapper may be
the other missing boy from 10 years ago.
- <i>Mike Taylor.</i>
- You said that he was a large man.
He is.
He also calls himselfJoshua.
And Bryce will also
be named Joshua.
A new name from a new parent.
- A father figure.
- And there's our connection.
They are my brothers.
They areJoshua, like me.
<i>[Jarod On Speaker]</i>
<i>Where have you taken the boy?</i>
You've told me
everything else.
Why not tell me
where he was taken?
- He can't say.
- Joshua can't say.
<i>He will takeJoshua</i>
<i>into the woods.</i>
Joshua doesn't wanna
go into the woods.
- Ask him about the woods.
- What's in the woods?
You two are scary.
- Joshua can't say.
- Why can't you say?
- Father.
- <i>[Jarod] Who is Father?</i>
Is this you?
Your name isn'tJoshua.
It's Theodore.
<i>Theodore Reed.</i>
My name is Joshua.
My name is Joshua.
My name is Joshua.
Joshua doesn't wanna
go into the woods.
- Because of Father?
- Anything for Father.
Everything for Father.
Anything for Father.

- <i>Everything for Father.</i>
- Where is the boy?
- Anything for Father.
- Where is the boy?
- Everything for Father.
Anything for Father.
Everything for Father.
Anything for Father.
<i>This isn't someone</i>
<i>who is lying.</i>
It's not that he
won't tell us. He can't.
The way he shuts down when I
ask him difficult questions-
classic signs of
psychological patterning.
- Yes. Brainwashing.
- As much as we'd like to think...
some C.I.A. Spook perfected it
during the Cold War...
these men aren't
a product of that.
Well, they weren't men
when they were kidnapped.
When a child
is taken from his home...
he eventually loses all sense
of what is real and unreal.
<i>Without that connection</i>
<i>to the people that he loves...</i>
<i>without that nurturing,</i>
<i>his mind can easily be molded.</i>
<i>And his loyalty is changed,</i>
<i>his intellect honed.</i>
His very identity so altered,
he doesn't even know who he is anymore.
How do you know all of this?
They're going to do to Bryce
what was done to them.
- Brainwash him?
- [Jarod] If the boy measures up.
And if he doesn't?
In 26 hours...
<i>Bryce Banks</i>
<i>could be gone forever.</i>
[No Audible Dialogue]
- <i>[Man] You're running out of time.</i>
- Yeah, I know.
- <i>[Man] You're running out of time.</i>
- Yeah, I know.
Look, we need to try another tack
in finding the connection...
between Bryce Banks
and the other kidnapped boys.
- Father figures.
- We're talking pastors, coaches, scout leaders.
- That kind of thing.
- Anyone they could look up to
in place of their real father.
We're on it, Sam.
So how's Detective Doyle?
That's one I haven't
figured out yet.
[Young Raines]
You did it, Jarod. You won.
[Young Jarod]
Does that mean I can see my mom and dad?
We've already explained that to you.
We're your family now.
Look how proud you've
made us here today.
I almost feel like your father.
<i>[Knocking]</i>
- Sam.
- Oh, hi. I hope I'm not disturbing you.
Uh, how did you
find out where I was?
- Uh, Logan told me.
- Oh.
- May I?
- Oh, <i>sure.</i> Come in.
- Thanks. No.
- I'm sorry.
Well, this isn't exactly where I had imagined
a talented law enforcement officer would live.
I'm, uh, sort of
in between places right now.
- Yes.
- Sorry about the mess.
No. None of
my business, really.
- It's a long story.
- Oh.
So, uh,
what can I do for you?
Well, I was just, uh,
curious about one thing.
- What's that?
- Why are you lying?
I felt there was something
bothering you about this case...
and when I looked at the video
of you questioning Joshua, I knew it.
- I don't understand.
- A child.
<i>A child trapped by his past.</i>
Lost, alone, afraid.
With all due respect, I don't think that
I'm the one that you should be profiling.
Well, I'm sorry.
It's a bad habit of mine.
- Who are you, Jarod?
- What do you mean?
[Laughs] Come on. You eat candy
out of a toy dispenser.
<i>You have your whole life</i>
<i>laid out around you.</i>
<i>Classic textbook</i>
<i>misplaced childhood, I guess.</i>
No, I don't think there's
anything textbook about you.
My life has no bearing
on this case.
Well, I think that it does.
That interrogation-
<i>That interrogation</i>
<i>went nowhere...</i>
becauseJoshua Meyers
was programmed to shut down.
End of story.
You know, my mother died
when I was a little girl.
<i>And... my father-</i>
My father just
wasn't really around.
I was sort of raised by
my best friend's family.
<i>You had foster parents,</i>
<i>didn't you?</i>
Foster parents?
I guess you
could call them that.
Why is this case
so personal to you?
Let's just say that
I'm... dedicated.
Or maybe you're more likeJoshua
than you want to admit.
<i>[Big Joshua] I've done everything</i>
<i>as you instructed.</i>
I understand.
Yes, sir.
Your new son is almost ready.
[Beeps Off]
My name is Joshua.
Father is gonna be
so proud of you.
[Laughing]
No, Joshua, no! No!
You disappoint me, Joshua! Do you know
what happens when Father rejects you?
You go out into the woods...
and you don't come out, ever!
Ever.
Ask all you want.
I won't tell you where the boy is.
Whatever you say, Joshua.
A son should be called
by his given name...
especially if that name
was given to him by Father.
<i>Gave you a new name,</i>
<i>a whole new life.</i>
<i>He loved you when</i>
<i>your own father wouldn't.</i>
But part of his love
was doing his will...
and his will was to kidnap innocent
children and take them from their homes.
No. Bryce was unhappy.
His father didn't love him.
His new father will-
my father.
Before you were ripped away
from your real family, were you unhappy?
I wasn't taken.
I was set free.
Father doesn't make us do anything.
We do things for Father.
Of course.
After all, he's Father.
<i>You have to do whatever</i>
<i>he says, obey his will.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>Even ifhe asked you to...</i>
go into the woods?
<i>Why are you so afraid</i>
<i>of the woods, Joshua?</i>
<i>Is it because your brothers</i>
<i>are out there?</i>
- Brothers?
- Eight of you were taken...
but only two of you
becameJoshua.
The rest died in the woods.
Stop- Stop talking to me.
<i>What does your father make you do</i>
<i>in the woods, Joshua?</i>
Joshua-Joshua can't say.
<i>Well, maybe these pictures</i>
<i>will help you remember.</i>
- I don't want to look.
- What happened to this Joshua?
I don't want to look.
No, I don't want- I don't want to look.
Father didn't think he cut it...
so he asked you to go out
in the woods and do this to him.
He asked you to kill this boy, didn't he?
Look at the pictures, damn it!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
- Theodore-
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- Theodore, help me.
<i>Help me save Bryce.</i>
<i>[Sobbing Continues]</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
Ah, angel.
Ah, perfect timing.
Daddy, I need to
speak with you, alone.
Well, this is your family.
We, uh-We have no secrets.
- Daddy, I've recently learned-
- Miss Parker?
Oh. Excuse me. May we have
a word with you outside?
- Later.
- It's important.
Excuse me. One minute.
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
- What?
- I checked the contents of that s-
I checked the contents of the syringe.
It was Pergonal.
- What the hell is that?
- It's a drug.
But a fertility drug.
Fertility?
Are you sure?
Bridget wasn't trying to get high.
She was trying to get pregnant.
Oh. But with whose baby?
- <i>[Laughter]</i>
- <i>[Brigitte] So, Lyle and I
<i>came in here to celebrate.</i>
<i>I know I shouldn't, but I couldn't</i>
<i>help it. I was so excited!</i>
Too excited.
She spilled champagne all over my pants.
<i>I had to go into the bathroom</i>
<i>and clean myself up.</i>
Angel, you wanted
to tell me something.
It's nothing, Daddy.
I'm gonna get going.
<i>[Mr. Parker] No, wait. Wait. Wait a minute.</i>
<i>We have something to tell you.</i>
Brigitte and I are going to have,
uh, a little Parker.
<i>Congratulations, Miss P. You're gonna</i>
<i>have a baby brother or sister.</i>
<i>[Mr. Lyle]</i>
<i>Oh, this is fantastic!</i>
<i>[Mr. Parker] It turns out the erratic</i>
<i>behavior and mood swings...</i>
<i>had to do with fertility drugs.</i>
You know,
the hormones and what.
This is a surprise.
Yeah. Well, it's a happy day
for the family.
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>Don't be a poop.</i>
Happy days, indeed.
Go, go, go! Go!
The woods. The woods!
[Bryce]
Where are we going?
We're going for a walk
in the woods.
<i>Hello, Joshua.</i>
- <i>Who are you?</i>
- I'm the Father.
I'm your father.
Don't be afraid.
I've come to set you free.
- <i>[Detective] Drop the knife!</i>
- <i>[Guns Cocking]</i>
- Drop the knife!
- No, You don't understand.
- No, <i>you</i> don't understand.
- I am the Father. He is my son. I am Abraham.
- Come on, do this.
- I'm going to set-
[Sobbing]
No!
[Yelling]
[Grunting]
- No more-
- <i>Father.</i>
- Killing!
- All right, Jarod, we got him!
- No more! No more!
<i>Calm down, all right? Jarod.
No, no.
Everything for Father.
It's okay.
[Panting]
- It's okay. It's okay.
- [Sobbing]
It's okay now.
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
[Whispering]
Detective.
We can't thank you enough for giving us
a second chance with our son.
- How's your husband?
- I don't think he realizes the way he is.
But I do know that I'm
gonna do everything I can...
<i>to show our son</i>
<i>that there's more to life...</i>
than winning chess matches.
[Murmuring]
His name is Dr. Samson Dane.
He was a child psychologist.
He treated Meyers, Taylor
and the other missing boys.
He used his influence to lure them
away from their families.
Dane's own son died
of a genetic disorder.
My guess is his name was Joshua.
All these years he was
trying to recreate a family.
They're being admitted
to a psychiatric facility.
With any luck,
they'll be deprogrammed.
- What about their parents?
- They're seeing them today.
Ten years is a long time.
A child never forgets
the people who love him.
- Well, l-
- Oh, wait. I almost forgot.
- [Chuckles]
- I got you this.
For me? Thank you. Uh...
- [Laughs]
- For the kid in you. [Chuckles]
- Good luck, Jarod.
- Thank you.
I'll see you.
- You wanted to see me?
- Angel.
Shut the door, please.
Yeah.
[Clears Throat] I thought maybe we could,
uh, have lunch together.
Is something wrong?
Why does something have to be wrong
when a father asks his daughter to lunch?
It doesn't. It's just- I'm sorry, Daddy.
I didn't mean it that way.
Oh, that's all right.
I probably deserved it.
I just thought we could sit down and-
[Clears Throat] talk... for a while.
God knows you've-
you've been through a lot, huh?
- I would love to have lunch with you.
- Good. Good.
- We need to speak with you, alone.
- Not now, Raines.
- It'll have to wait.
- It can't.
- [Chuckles]
- [Brigitte] Sweetheart.
<i>[Kissing]</i>
- Ooh!
- Ooh!
<i>That's okay, Daddy.</i>
<i>I seem to have lost my appetite anyway.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, angel.</i>
<i>We'll try another time.</i>
Hmm?
I've just received a priority-one intercept
from Ellesmere Island.
- Our research facility?
- There's been a breach in security.
<i>Someone has compromised</i>
<i>the Alpha Project.</i>
It appears to be Major Charles.
Jarod's father?
- <i>Jarod's father was at Ellesmere?</i>
- <i>[Mr. Lyle] Was and still could be.</i>
Raines, I thought you made an aching void
out of the good major a long time ago!
- So did I.
- <i>God, if the Triumvirate hears about this-</i>
<i>[Raines]</i>
<i>We must proceed with caution, but without delay.</i>
Find out everything you can about
Major Charles and this breach.
[Mr. Parker] Raines, I thought you made an
aching void out of the good major a long time ago!
- So did I.
- God, if the Triumvirate hears about this-
[Raines] We must proceed with caution,
but without delay.
Find out everything you can about
Major Charles and this breach.
No matter what it takes,
no one is to know what went on there.
[Rewinding]
- Jarod's father was at Ellesmere?
- [Mr. Lyle] Was and still could be.
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out,
I've spent every moment searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
- Repeat, 25-Bravo-Tango.
- [Man On Radio] You heard me.
I'm droppin' off another addition
to your little Arctic oasis.
<i>Check again, sport.
We're not scheduled for
any new arrivals till spring.
My orders say you're
gettin' a new scientist now.
You got a problem, you take it up
with someone who cares. I'm out of here.
<i>Two hours of daylight's about up,</i>
<i>and one hell of a front's headin'in.</i>
Waah, waah, waah.
<i>Captain, we got company.
[Groans]
[Man]
This place has quite a history.
It's built on top of
the original station from 1920.
That first team, all eight of'em?
Found 'em froze to death a year later.
Didn't even get the bodies
out until the '40s.
It's been cursed here ever since.
Let's just say I have
my reasons for being here.
See this photograph?
I realize it's old, but I have reason to believe
that this man was here recently.
- Did you bring him?
- Not me.
<i>You're the only person I've seen</i>
<i>crazy enough to come up here in months.</i>
The end of the road.
Maybe you should come in until
this blows over. It's getting worse.
I'd rather take my chances out here
in this weather than inside of that place.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Hey! Close the freakin' door!
It's 40 below out there!
It's actually 85 below with wind chill,
but who's counting?
Hi. My name is Jarod, Jarod Meade.
You must be the welcoming committee.
No, I'm Smitty. I run the comm.
What the hell are you doin' here?
I'm a climatologist with Earthwatch.
I'm here to monitor weather systems.
- Oh, uh, like that El Nińo thing?
- Something like that.
- The chopper didn't leave, did it?
- Hold on! Slow down!
Ain't nobody goin' anywhere today.
The chopper's already gone.
No! I gotta get out of here before-
[Unintelligible Shouts]
Hey, you're gonna freeze to death
if you go out there, pal.
All right, uh, get on the radio
and call the chopper back.
I'm not gonna do that, Manny.
Eh-
<i>You- You get on that radio,</i>
<i>and you call that chopper back!</i>
- Now!
- I couldn't if I wanted to, man.
<i>There's a storm comin'in.</i>
<i>There aren't gonna be no choppers for days.</i>
- You're lyin'!
- He's telling you the truth.
The chopper can't come back now.
- Who the hell are you?
- <i>My name is Jarod.</i>
I can't get you out now, but I'll do whatever
it takes to get you out as soon as possible.
You can do it?
Put the bottle down.
Yeah.
Uh, I don't want
to hurt no one, you know?
I just, uh- I just can't stay here.
L- I gotta get out of here.
- It'll be okay, Manny.
- <i>Your hand is bleeding.</i>
- Is there a doctor here?
- Yeah.
Um, l-I'm sorry, you know? I just, uh...
gotta get out of here before
the- the Qallupilluit gets me.
Yeah.
- Did he cut me?
- I think you're going to be okay.
Thanks, man.
You can hang your parka
on a- on a hook there.
- Thanks. Qallupilluit?
- Yeah.
<i>It's about a local legend</i>
<i>or somethin'up here.</i>
See, Manny's a geology tech.
He's a really nice guy...
but I think he's been blastin'
a little too much dynamite lately.
<i>I mean, he-he talks kinda crazy</i>
<i>sometimes, but, uh...</i>
I've never seen him that cranked up.
Well, when you're done here,
I'll show you the rest of the freak show.
<i>Now, what letters</i>
<i>make a cook dishonest?</i>
Yes?
[Together]
"R." Put the "R" after "C"...
and "cook" becomes "crook."
Very good. And, um...
how do you make mice...
cold?
You know, sometimes you two
really scare me.
<i>[Whispering] We're studying the effects</i>
<i>of aging on memory processing and retrieval.</i>
<i>Using identical twins as controls.</i>
Would it be possible
for the both of you...
to stop playing Mr. Wizard
long enough for me to ask a question?
- Sure.
- Absolutely.
- Something's going on with Mr. Raines.
- When isn't there?
He slithered into my father's office
with Lyle and the troll.
Practically threw me out.
Oh, that must have been because of that
priority-one intercept that Raines received.
- What intercept?
- I didn't tell you?
What? If Dr. Freud can
spare you from this sideshow...
I want you to find out
what the other one's about.
Uh...
about those mice-
<i>You know, the first thing you learn...</i>
is bein' on top of the world
is the last place you want to be.
Oh, Captain!
<i>Captain, this is, uh, Jarod Meade.</i>
<i>He's doin'. uh, hole-in-the-ozone research.</i>
Put that damn thing out, will ya?
Jarod.
- <i>[Jarod] Hi, how are you?</i>
- Did I stutter, Smitty? Put it out.
Seeing as how I'm in charge, you want to explain
how I haven't heard anything about this?
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>You receive scientists from a variety of institutes.</i>
I imagine that lines of communication
get crossed from time to time.
- As I learned in the military-
- Crossed communications get people killed.
Well, you say it all the time.
What I have here, Jarod,
is people who track glacial flow...
<i>monitor ocean temperatures</i>
<i>and take core samples.</i>
What I don't have are any orders
for some Weather Channel veejay.
My authorization papers.
<i>I'm here to evaluate the effects</i>
<i>of ozone depletions for a congressional study.</i>
- Senator Bruckmeyer himself?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
Well, I'm gonna check this out.
Smitty, for now, put him in
the, uh, guest quarters.
- <i>[Manny] Thanks, Doc.</i>
- This way, Ozone.
<i>[Doc] You might want to wait a few days</i>
<i>before you go blasting any new holes outside.</i>
Here. Keep that wrapped.
[Murmurs]
- How's your hand?
- A little sore.
Hello. My name is Jarod.
- Raymond Moore. The guys call me Doc.
- It's a pleasure, Doc.
I gotta admit. We're all a little surprised
to see you here.
By the looks on everyone's face,
you don't get too many visitors around here.
Tour of duty's 12 months.
I'm the only one here on permanent assignment.
- I'm not sure if that makes me dedicated or crazy.
- Hm!
Hey, Doc, I gotta show him
where he's <i>staying.</i> Come on.
Nice to meet you, Doc.
- You know, you gotta excuse our mess.
- <i>[Man] You know what?</i>
<i>You can just kiss my butt, all right?</i>
<i>Lady, you are so full of it!</i>
You know what? I am not a lab rat,
and I am sick and tired of you pickin' my brain.
So from now on, you know what you do?
Stay the hell away from me.
- Joe, look, it-
- It's Joe Taylor, all right?
- Can you say that? Tay-lor!
- Whatever.
- Exactly.
- What, Beth givin' you a hard time again?
[Scoffs]
Man, as long as she's breathin', all right?
- Yo, so you must be the new, uh, El Nińo guy.
- Wha- [Chuckles]
- Yeah.
- Yeah. How did you know?
Word travels fast in the igloo,
you know, with the echo and all.
<i>[Electrical Crackling, Whining]</i>
Excuse me, ladies.
I got a generator to check.
You weren't askin'Joe Taylor
about his feelings again, were ya?
The problem is
none of you guys have any.
Ah, cute. Beth's up here in the freezer
doin' her doctoral thesis in psych.
Oh. Uh, I have a, uh...
<i>friend of mine who's a psychiatrist.</i>
Lucky you. You'll need one
after you've been up here for a while.
- What's she studying?
- Us.
She's into the cabin-fever B. <i>S. -
you know, like,
why people in Minnesota, they-
they start blowin' their brains out
and killin' each other when they get snowed in.
Has something like that happened here?
Is that why she came?
Uh, l-You know, l-l-
I don't- She's got some fat grant
from some outfit in Delaware.
The Centre.
Uh, hey, you know, maybe. I don't know.
L-I'm- I'm just the radio geek.
<i>Well, here we are-</i>
<i>the guest quarters.</i>
<i>Well, uh, it ain't exactly the Westin,</i>
<i>but, uh, the toilet flushes...</i>
- most of the time.
- No wonder you don't get many visitors.
Well, make yourself at home.
I gotta get back to station.
Seems like everyone around here's
a little sensitive about that subject-
visitors, I mean.
Well, like Doc said, uh,
we don't get no new blood.
No one?
Has this man been here?
You figure out a way to get me
south of the 50th parallel...
<i>maybe I'll tell you about all the weird stuff</i>
<i>that goes on around here.</i>

No. On the contrary.

and how to proceed.
- [Cracking]
- Oh!
- [Beeps Off]
- That's it. That's the spot, Harry.
[Moaning]
<i>Raines, I thought you made an aching void</i>
<i>out of the good major a long time ago!</i>
- So did I.
- God, if the Triumvirate hears about this-

I was just checking on the weather.
Hope you don't mind.
Well, I mind if you're
using my computer!
Well, my terminal hasn't been set up yet,
so I thought we could share.
Uh, I don't "share."
You don't smile much either, do you?
- As a matter of fact,
no one smiles much around here.
- Oh, please.
Even for a psychologist,
it must be difficult to figure out...
who has cabin fever
and who doesn't.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- We all share the same cabin.
- <i>Major Charles arrived</i>
<i>at the station three weeks ago.</i>
- Is he still there?
- We're not sure.
- What about the project?
The entire file has been accessed.
We must assume he knows everything.
- There's something else.
- What?
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
- [Woman] Right this way.
<i>[Chattering]</i>
Jarod has appeared,
and he's still there.
Jarod? Well, get a Sweeper team

We've been trying.
The weather won't cooperate.
What about our inside-
What about our inside people?
Are they up to speed on this?
Totally. I've issued specific orders on how
to handle everything, including Jarod.
We're covering all of our tracks.
We're just waiting to see what
Major Charles's next move is.
- In other words, we're a day late and a dollar short.
- As usual.

Smitty's dead.
<i>Must have blacked out</i>
<i>from smoke or solvent fumes.</i>
Must've fallen, hit his head on the table corner,
knocked himself out...
- died of smoke inhalation.
- That's a hell of a head injury for a table corner.
Doc, listen, I'll feel better if you get
Smitty down to the infirmary...
<i>give his body a closer look, all right?</i>
I'm not a pathologist,
but I'll see what I can find out.
- I gotta call this in.
- Don't even bother. This thing is busted.
- That's not good.
- Oh, my God!
<i>Is he dead?</i>
We have to notify the authorities and-
and his family.
We can't.
The radio's completely shot.
We have no communication

- Yeah, so no one can hear us scream for help.
- Hey, Manny.

Why, let me guess: Jarod?
No! Jarod's father.
Major Charles?
- Where?
- Well, uh...
I don't know where, and l-
I don't- I don't know...
uh, what the project is yet.

I do, and I'm going back to work right now.
[Clears Throat]
I know you believe thatJarod's father <i>may</i>
be responsible for your mother's death-
<i>Is</i> responsible for my mother's death-
a score I intend to settle.
Don't let your desire for revenge
cloud your judgment, Parker.
- If we ever find Major Charles-
- [Beeping]
He'll be much more
valuable to us alive...
than he would dead.
- I didn't hear you come in.
- I came to offer my assistance
with Smitty's autopsy...
but I... guess I'm too late.
- I thought you were a weatherman, not a coroner.
- Let's just say I'm versatile.
Someone with more
pathology experience...
should examine the body
when we get him out of here.
- For now, I'm confident I've been
able to establish the cause of death.
- <i>[Clattering]</i>
- What'd you find out?
- <i>No surprises-</i>
mild concussion,
no other signs of injury.
- Cause of death:
Accidental, due to smoke inhalation.
- Accidental?
<i>It better be.</i>
<i>If it wasn't, then one of us did it.</i>
- Jarod, let's talk.
- In a minute.
Jarod, right now!
You mind tellin' me
what that was back there?
Smitty's death was not accidental.
Listen, pal, this place breeds
cabin fever and paranoia.
If the doc says it was an accident,
then it <i>was.</i> Case closed.
There's more going on here than cabin fever,
and Smitty knew it.
<i>There's something very wrong here.</i>
<i>I can feel it and so do you.</i>
If there's something goin' on here, that just
makes the stress on the men that much worse.
- It's my job to keep this place from fallin' apart.
- Someone will come for us.
You taken a look out there lately?
It'll be days.
<i>Not even those crazy Inuits and their dog sleds</i>
<i>go out in weather like this.</i>
<i>Until then, we are stranded. I don't need any</i>
<i>loose talk makin'things worse. You understand?</i>
<i>[Labored Breathing]</i>
[Relieved Sigh]
You scared the hell out of me.
You mind if I join you?
Is that yours?
- My son.
- He's cute.
- You must be very proud.
- I never even seen him.
<i>My wife found out she was pregnant</i>
<i>just after I shipped up here.</i>
Got two months left on my contract.
They won't let me go home.
I'm never gonna see him.
Of course you will.
You'll be going home soon.
No, I'm not.
No one's goin' home alive.
Manny.
Manny!
Manny.
- What's Qallupilluit?
- <i>An old Inuit story...</i>
about an evil creature
that lives in the ice cracks.
It kills those that get too close.
Smitty said there was a stranger here.
Did you see anybody?
The Qallupilluit is here.
It's under the station.
I hear him sometimes at night.
- Where under the station?
- I don't know!
I hear him from my bunk.
He's in the floor, in the walls, everywhere!
This man was here.
Have you seen him?
I want to see
my son and my wife!
- You promised you'd get me out of here!
- Manny, Manny! Hey, hey, hey!
<i>Come on. Manny, you all right?
You okay? Look-
<i>[Clanging]</i>
Why don't you go to the doc and have him
take a look at that, okay? Go ahead.
Manny's goin' through a lot of stress right now.
He doesn't need you makin' it worse, okay?
- What's he so stressed out about?
- It's none of your business.
You know, I really
don't know who you are.
But ever since you showed up here,
things have been going from bad to worse.
So why don't you just-
<i>Manny, what? What?</i>
- What? What? Talk to me, man!
- It got- It got- It got Doc!
- <i>The Qallupilluit! It got Doc!</i>
- Get the captain.
<i>Come on!
Doc!
Doc.
The incinerator!
- Doc's death was no accident.
- You implyin' that one of us is a killer?
I warned you the men were experiencing
disturbing levels of isolation stress...
- <i>and that they were at the breaking point!</i>
- <i>You got somethin'to say?</i>
Say it, all right? It wasn't me!
- Then why did you decide to go
to the infirmary when you did?
- I tore my stitches!
When? When you were struggling with Doc,
or when you threw him in the incinerator?
- What?
- Wait a minute! I know what you're doin'!
You put things in people's minds that don't
even belong there. Don't walk away from me!
<i>[Beth]</i>
<i>Get away from me! Back off, Joe!</i>
- Where was you when we found Doc?
- Everybody, calm down!
What did you say?
What about you?
- Maybe this is all of your doing, huh?
- Maybe it wasn't any one of us.
<i>Maybe there's someone here with us.</i>
[Scoffs]
What, like Manny's Qallupilluit?
<i>No, he's right, man. I seen someone.</i>
<i>A man, comin'and goin'with the Inuits.</i>
<i>He was with them a couple of weeks ago.</i>
<i>Joe saw him too.</i>
- No. No, I didn't.
- Joe. Joe, you saw him.
- You were with me, man.
- Joe Taylor, talk to us.
I caught a glimpse of him
when they were deliverin' the supplies.
Did anybody see him leave?
[Gasps]
Joe Taylor, check the generator,
then bolt the door to the mechanical room.
We lose power in a storm like this,
it's a death sentence for all of us.
<i>Manny, salvage whatever you can from</i>
<i>the infirmary. We may need it before this is over.</i>
When you guys are finished,
you come back in here.
- We're gonna stay together till
we get help from the outside.
- If outside help arrives.
- Shut up!
- Tell me, why are you the one
that gets to keep the gun?
'Cause I am the one with the gun.
Now do what I told ya.
<i>Come on, man.</i> Come on.
I have no idea what the hell's
goin' on around here...
but I sure in hell
am gonna find out.
<i>[Mr. Parker]</i>
<i>Find out everything you can...</i>
about Major Charles and this breach.
- Where did you get this?
- Someone from within the Centre...
e-mailed a video of your father's office
to an off-site location.
- <i>All I had to do was retrieve the original feed.</i>
- That's why they made me leave.
Good work. Broots.
- Who sent it?
- Well, it's hard to say.
- But I know who it was sent to.
- Jarod?
Yeah. From what I can tell,
Major Charles found out...
- about something called the Alpha Project.
- Never heard of it.
- Neither have we.
- [Clears Throat]
Well, whatever it is, it's being run...
from an Arctic research station
funded by the Centre.
Obviously, Major Charles <i>was</i> there-
may still be.
<i>Cinch up your long johns, boys.
We're heading north.
Gonna heat things up a little bit.
<i>[Mechanical Whining]</i>
<i>[Labored Breathing]</i>
So everything is goin'
like you planned.
Except for that guy, Jarod, man.
He's gonna be a problem.
So what do you want to do next?
Angel, about yesterday, l-
Wh-What are you doing?
Isn't that the gun that, uh-
When your mother was, uh-
- Are you here for lunch, Daddy?
- Something bothering you?
Yeah.
Major Charles.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
Well, you've been through enough.
I just didn't want to see you like this.
I'm going to Ellesmere, Daddy.
We don't even know whether
Major Charles is still there.
What are you really afraid of?
That I may find Major Charles-
[Whispers]
Or what drove him there?
- [Screams]
- It's just me. It's just me.
- What are you doing?
- All right, just calm down.
I'm not the killer,
and I don't think you are.
<i>Could we just talk?
[Crying]
No!
Wait! Wait, please don't go.
I'm sorry. I'm- Please, sit down.
I just- I think I'm losing it.
- What do you really think's going on around here?
- I can't explain it.
<i>It's like there's something</i>
<i>insidious growing here-</i>
something that's destroying us all.
Like what?
[Sniffles]
<i>Call it insanity... or whatever you want.
It's the same thing.
You can see it in the eyes of the men.
<i>It's the capacity for evil</i>
<i>that lies dormant in all of us...</i>
only something here
is bringing it to life.
The visitor-
the person who Manny saw.
- Was he this man?
- Yeah, that's the guy.
<i>It's a younger version ofhim,</i>
<i>but that's the guy.</i>
I saw him talking to the captain,
and the captain gave him a package.
Beth, do you think
he could still be here?
<i>Do you think this is the man</i>
<i>who killed Doc and Smitty?</i>
It's possible.
<i>I heard Doc tell the captain that he was</i>
<i>dangerous and capable of doing anything...</i>
which is why I came
to get the knife.
I don't trust anyone-
except maybe you.
Maybe.
<i>[Electrical Crackling]</i>
- The generator.
- Oh, my God.
[Beth]
Oh, my God! Joe!
<i>Joe!</i>
Don't touch him!
[Beth Grunts]
He's dead.
<i>No, man! No!</i>
<i>Joe, come on, get up, man!</i>
Stop playin' around, man!
Get up!
- You did this.
- Manny, come on now.
First you killed Smitty.
Then you burned up Doc.
<i>Manny, stop it right there.</i>
- Then you sentJoe Taylor in here
to check on the generator.
- Manny-
Please don't make me do this.
I'm not waitin' around to be next!
- <i>[Jarod] Captain, no!</i>
- Crazy bastard! You forced me to do that!
You didn't have to shoot him!
God, Manny, are you okay?
We're gonna take you to the infirmary.
This'll stop the bleeding.
It's just a flesh wound.
He needs medical attention.
Is that right?
- What are you doing?
- I know I'm not the killer.
Jarod was with me when the power went out.
It couldn't be either one of us.
- Then maybe the both of you did it.
- <i>[Jarod] Maybe it's none of us.</i>
If you let me take a look at Smitty's body,
maybe I can tell you who the killer is.
The only thing you're gonna take a look
at is the inside of that storage locker...
<i>where I'm gonna put you</i>
<i>till I figure out what to do.</i>
Now get him up!
- Put us in there, man, 'cause I'm gonna kill you.
- Now!
Worse than the Qallupilluit will ever get you, man.
I'm comin' after you, Captain!
- Let's go! Let's go!
- <i>Comin'after you, man!</i>
- <i>Let's go, people! Move!</i>
- It's gonna get you good!
Manny, shut up! Wait a minute.
We got a problem.
I was here right before the power went out.
I know I locked this door.
What is it?
Dynamite's missing.
So either the two of you are lying,
or we are not alone.
[Manny] Our Father,
who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
- That should do for now.
- Thanks.
Both the generators are blown.
We're gonna need these coats.
Manny?
We're gonna get out of here now.
- What'd you find?
- Your Qallupilluit.
What do you mean?
If you want to find the killer,
we have to find a dead man.
- <i>[Broots] Wow! Sydney, look at those clouds.</i>
- <i>It's an Arctic front.</i>
I've never seen anything like that.
Miss Parker, take a look.
I'll catch it in <i>National Geographic.</i>
How much longer?
[Woman] Looks like I'm gonna have to put
down for a few hours at a Canadian air base.
- Weather's still too rough to get any closer-
- Great.
If we can't get in,
they can't get out.
<i>I don't understand.</i>
<i>What dead man?</i>
There's no sign of searing
or smoke in his lungs.
- He was dead before the fire
because of the blow to his head.
- Why would Doc lie?
The scalpel that we all assumed killed Doc
is covered with 0-positive blood.
But according to his chart,
Doc's blood type was B-negative.
W-We saw the skeleton
in the incinerator.
Remember your laboratory skeleton?
It's missing.
- Doc killed Smitty?
- [Beth] And faked his own death.
- But someone had to have helped him.
- Joe Taylor.
<i>He was probably</i>
<i>helping Doc all along.</i>
When Doc faked his own death,
he had to killJoe Taylor to cover his tracks.
Doc is still here doin' all this?
Why?
Maybe we should ask the captain.
What?
You know more about what's going on
in this place than you are letting on.
- I knew you were a part of this.
- He's not.
But he knew who the visitor was...
and why he was here.
It was you that Major Charles
came to see in the first place.
What do you know
about Major Charles?
He's my father.
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
Sorry, guys.
It's still gonna be 24 hours before
we can get a chopper in there.
Thank you, Captain.
- <i>[Door Shuts]</i>
- [Exhales]
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
<i>Are you prepared for what</i>
<i>or who we may find out there?</i>
I'm not sure.
This is...
surreal.
So much of my life-
my mother's death,
the Centre, Jarod-
<i>all leading to this moment.</i>
There's a sense of something...
ominous waiting for us.
- Overwhelming sense of impending doom?
- What?
- Nothing.
- I just hope we're not too late.
Your father and I served together
in the air <i>force-</i> Circle of Fire Unit.
<i>My wife and I were very close</i>
<i>to him and to your mom.</i>
We helped him search
for you for years.
Several years after your disappearance,
I heard that the major had been murdered.
A little over a year ago,
your father contacted me.
- Why?
- To tell me what the Centre had
done to him and to his family.
You see, Jarod, he- he never
stopped searchin' for you.
<i>Then he found out what the Centre</i>
<i>was workin'on here...</i>
under cover of this research facility-
- And he asked for your help.
- <i>And I agreed.</i>
The idea was to expose the plan and then
hopefully reunite him with his family-
with you.
My guess is there is another
research facility on-site...
probably somewhere near.
It took me a little over eight months
to come to the same conclusion.
<i>It's right down here.</i>
<i>[Beth] This must be what's left</i>
<i>of the original station from the '20s.</i>
<i>[Captain] With a slight modification.</i>
<i>Its own independent power source.</i>
I finally found this place
several weeks ago.
- <i>I was able to get the evidence</i>
<i>your father was lookin'for.</i>
- <i>[Beth] Evidence of what?</i>
<i>What they were actually</i>
<i>researching here.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>This equipment-</i>
- It was used for amino-acid sequencing.
- Why would they need that here?
They were doing genetic research.
Amino acids...
are sequenced in an infinite
number of patterns...
which in turn form the basic building blocks
for all life- D.N.A.
- In this case, human D.N.A.
- Dr. Moore was working on
the Human Genome Project.
<i>More than working.</i>
<i>Dr. Moore was a brilliant geneticist.</i>
He had completed mapping
the human genome years ago.
While the rest of science attempts
what he's already achieved.
- What's a genome?
- A genetic blueprint for human life.
- You mean he figured out
God's cookbook for human beings?
- Exactly.
But why hide
such a significant discovery?
<i>Unleashing the secrets</i>
<i>could be used to benefit mankind.</i>
Or unleash a Qallupilluit. What was the Centre
planning on doing with this research?
I don't know.
Your father discovered their secret.
- They're using this research to create a-
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>
[Screaming]
[Doc] I knew when we met,
you weren't here to watch the weather.
- What have you done with my father?
- Unfortunately, nothing.
He found what he came for
and left before I was able to stop him.
- <i>If your father hadn't come,</i>
<i>none of this'd be necessary.</i>
- [Groaning]
- You mean, killing everybody,
you crazy son of a bitch?
- Yes, Manuel.
- You took the dynamite.
- No one can ever know what happened here.
There's a timer set to detonate in three minutes,
but... you needn't fear that blast.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Beth, look out!</i>
[Gunshot]
You okay?
- <i>[Manny] He's dead.</i>
- [Shuddering]
- Captain.
- [Gasping]
- I'm going to get you out of here.
- There's no time.
You have to get Beth and Manny
out of here before it blows.
Use this. My friends at the Inuit camp
monitor the same band.
- They'll help you like they helped your father.
- My father?
I sent him to my daughter's.
You'll find him there.
<i>Oh- Oh, God.</i>
Give her this.
<i>[Gasping, Shuddering]</i>
Tell my daughter I love her.
I will. I promise you.
<i>Captain, what was it
that my father found here?
It wasn't just... any human genome
they were working on.
It was yours.
[Panting]
<i>Captain.</i> Captain!
- We have to go now.
- <i>[Manny] Come on, man.</i>
<i>She's right. We gotta go.</i>
- <i>[Beth]Jarod, come on!</i>
- [Beeps]
- <i>Jarod, now!</i>
- <i>[Manny] Come on!</i>
[Dogs Yipping]
[Dogs Yipping]
<i>[Helicopter Whirring]</i>
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Miss Parker, this must be what hell looks like.</i>
<i>You know, frozen over.</i>
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>an old research lab.</i>
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>Jarod's father was looking for?</i>
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>What is it, Miss Parker?</i>
It's a brass trigger
for an incendiary device.
Whatever was going on down here,
Jarod didn't want anyone to find out about it.
Yeah, but why would he want to
cover his tracks now?
Maybe it wasn'tJarod
who set off the bomb.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Then who did and why?</i>
<i>Combo to Al Capone's vault?</i>
Ah, just some burned-out trash.
- <i>[Sam] Miss Parker!</i>
- <i>[Miss Parker] What is it, Sam?</i>
- We found another body.
- <i>[Broots] Do you think it's Jarod?</i>
No. Jarod's been a phoenix one too many times
for me to believe he's still in these ashes.
<i>Give my daughter my ring.</i>
<i>And this photo.</i>
<i>Tell her that I love her.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I will.</i>
<i>Captain, what was it
that my father found here?
Wasn't just any human D.N.A.
They were deciphering.
It was yours.
[Gasps]
Demons live in your dreams.
[Jarod]
They visit.
<i>The ones who cause</i>
<i>you and your father trouble...</i>
<i>were at the research station.</i>
What did they find?
What they search for
is no longer there.
Before your father left,
he told me he was going to find his son.
<i>He would stare for hours</i>
<i>at the constellation...</i>
<i>talk about the son that he knew</i>
<i>he would one day find.</i>
- The constellation?
- Yes, uh-
<i>Gemini.</i>
<i>He told me if I ever met you</i>
<i>to give you these.</i>
Is this him?
- <i>Is this my father?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>
Gemini. What does it mean?
He left a message for you.
<i>This is where you'll find him.</i>
<i>This is where</i>
<i>you'll find your father.</i>
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>There are Pretenders among us.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I was taken from my family.</i>
<i>Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
<i>How many people died</i>
<i>because of what I thought up?</i>
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He's a Pretender-</i>
<i>A genius who can become</i>
<i>anyone that he wants to be.</i>
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>He defends the weak and abused.</i>
Life's a gift.
- <i>You a doctor?</i>
- I am today.
- <i>[Chattering]</i>
- [Wheels Squeaking]
I received a call from the Triumvirate
this morning. Big Mutumbo himself.
He knows thatJarod and his father
were in the Arctic...
and he knows about how our project up there
has been compromised.
[Mr. Parker]
Damn. What did he say?
Except for the fact thatJarod's still out there,
he was, strangely enough, elated.
He's taking the compromising of the research as-
and I quote- "a sign from God."
Well, that's an odd comment
coming from an admitted atheist.
Mutumbo's ordered the acceleration
of Project Gemini.
- He wants delivery A.S.A.P.
- [Elevator Bell Dings]
- Is that a problem?
- No.
But Miss Parker might be.
Like mother like daughter.
You know how Catherine
felt about Gemini.
Secrecy has always been
the key to Gemini.
I'll handle my daughter.
Everything's gonna be just fine.
[Wheels Squeaking]
[Young Jarod]
I finished my building.
I'm finished!
[Young Sydney]
This one's been with us for only 36 hours...
<i>and he's already demonstrating</i>
<i>more talent than any of our others.</i>
- <i>[Young Jarod] Hey. I'm finished.</i>
- <i>Hi, Jarod. I'm Sydney.</i>
- I'll be taking care of you for a while.
- Why? Where's my mom and dad?
<i>[Clears Throat]</i>
<i>I, uh, know it's none of my business, Syd...</i>
<i>but sometimes memory lane</i>
<i>could be a dead-end street.</i>
<i>You're right, Broots.</i>
None of your business.
What is it?
Um, the bodies found in the Arctic
came up negative forJarod.
<i>Still, I can't figure out how</i>
<i>he escaped that inferno.</i>
- <i>[Phone Rings]</i>
- Jarod's always been too smart
for anyone to figure out.
- [Beeps]
- [Jarod] It's cold in the Arctic, Sydney.
Almost as frigid as the Centre.
- Thank God you got out of there alive.
- Barely.
- But I made some interesting discoveries.
- Tell me.
What? The boys in Blue Cove haven't kept you
in the D.N.A. Loop? Or should I say strand?
I wasn't even aware
that we had a facility up there.
- None of us were.
- They're stirring the genetic stew, Sydney.
Deciphering the human genome.
And not just anyone's. Mine.
My God.
Did you find your father?
No. But I know he risked his life
to find the same answers that I did.
Does the word Gemini
mean anything to you?
The zodiac sign?
- Why?
- I'll ask my father.
- I'm on my way to see him now.
- How will you know how to get there?
- He left me the stars to navigate by.
- [Beeps]
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
Syd, I've known you
all my life.
You knew my mother- how she had a psychiatric
session with you just hours before she died.
- Uh- [Clears Throat] I'm gonna go.
- Sit.
Now, I'm gonna
ask you a question...
and I need to know
the truth.
What is it you want to know?
Did my mother
ever mention a project-
a reference code, anything-
that had to do with the word Gemini?
I'm sorry.
Never heard of it.
Damn it.
<i>My father, Mr. Raines, Lyle-</i>
<i>They're shutting me out of something big.</i>
Something they called
Project Gemini.
Uh, you mean like the twins.
Since Dr. Know-Nothing
can't help...
I guess that's, uh-
<i>No. We're</i> going to find out.
<i>[Door Opens, Closes]</i>
Excuse me.
Number seven, please.
- Right there.
- Thank you.
<i>[Phone Disconnect Signal Beeping]</i>
<i>[Rattle]</i>
[Shouts]
- Where is he?
- Please don't hurt me, man.
Where is my father?
Jarod?
- Are you all right, Coop?
- Yeah, Sarah. Everything's fine.
- <i>You just go back to work.</i>
- Are you sure?
Ah, absolutely. You go on now.
Thank you very much.
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
- You'reJarod?
- <i>You're the major's son?</i>
- Yes, I am.
- <i>Where is he?</i>
- He left real fast.
- Almost like someone was hot on his trail.
- Men in Town Cars.
<i>And the scariest man</i>
<i>was a woman.</i>
A brunette?
Blonde.
Suckin' on a lollipop.
<i>Shejust left.</i>
Was my father hurt
when he left?
No. That-That's my blood.
They pushed my nose into the wall.
They-They damn near
broke my nose too.
<i>Like I said, I thought maybe</i>
<i>you was them comin'back.</i>
I'm sorry that you had to
get involved with this, Coop.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
Really, I didn't.
I'd do anything
for the major.
- <i>I'm gonna miss our talks.</i>
- Did he stay here a lot?
Well, off and on
for the past 20 years.
<i>Never was sure which direction</i>
<i>he was headed to next...</i>
<i>but I knew it was wherever</i>
<i>he thought you might be.</i>
Did he give you any idea
where he might be going?
No. He said I'd be
safer not knowin'.
- Do you have another phone book around?
- Sure.
Sarah, you got an extra
phone book on your cart?
Yeah. Here.
Take two.
<i>Thanks, darlin'.</i>
- What you lookin' for?
- What isn't here.
- I found something bizarre.
- What?
- Like hair on your head?
- No. That would be fantasy.
This is real.
This is very real.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>An inter-Centre memo?</i>
<i>[Broots] A very old one.</i>
<i>From your mother to the Triumvirate.</i>
"I vehemently disagree with
Dr. Raines's conclusions about Gemini...
<i>"and despite some humane</i>
<i>advances being made at Pakor...</i>
<i>"I cannot in good conscience</i>
<i>endorse moving forward with the project.</i>
<i>"While it represents a potentially major</i>
<i>breakthrough for mankind...</i>
<i>"one must wonder if mankind is</i>
<i>or ever will be prepared for its ramifications.</i>
<i>Catherine Parker. "
This is dated just days
before she was killed.
<i>Gemini. Isn't that the same thing you overheard</i>
<i>your father talking about?</i>
- Mom was against it.
- <i>I'm still searching Gemini...</i>
and I can't seem to find
anything about it.
Well, let's keep pushing, Broots.
And while you're at it, let's find out about Pakor.
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Okay, Miss Parker.</i>
<i>[Airplane Passing Overhead]</i>
<i>[Man On P.A.]</i>
<i>Attention. Ground school group class B-5...</i>
<i>will be held today in</i>
<i>Instruction Room 204.</i>
<i>Please make note of the change.</i>
Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm looking for someone.
Have you seen this man?
<i>The new instructor?</i>
<i>Sure.</i>
- Is he here now?
- Right behind you.
Not behind you behind you.
Behind you.
Up there.
<i>Does he have a radio with him?</i>
<i>Just wait. He's almost finished.</i>
<i>Why? You know him?</i>
He's my father.
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
No. Dad.
No.
- No!
- Gotcha.
Let's go.
We're done.
Move! Move!
Let's go!
- We need help!
- Dad!
Dad!
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Oh, my God. It's Dan Wilson.</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>It's tragic. Dan sneakin'up in your dad's plane.</i>
Major Charles's quarters
is right back here.
Your father must have left
early this morning.
Looks like he left
in a hurry too.
Thank you.
<i>[Shotgun Cocks]</i>
Give me one reason
not to shoot you.
<i>Carrie.
Your father sent me.
My father?
He wanted you to have these.
My father's dead,
isn't he?
<i>[Broots] I didn't find what I was looking for,</i>
<i>but I found some good stuff.</i>
Nothing about Gemini
or Pakor, I'm afraid.
But- But...
maybe something about
your father's secretiveness.
- And?
- I'm- I'm pretty sure it's aboutJarod's father.
They know where he is.
Well, your father and Raines have been
focusing in on one of the Arctic victims.
A Captain Russ Osborne.
Raines suspects that Osborne
was chummy with Major Charles...
and may have even helped him
get away from the research station.
- We got an address?
- Osborne's only next of kin was his daughter...
and she owns a small flight school
down in Barney Fife territory.
Uh, North Carolina.
So the assumption would be that-
Major Charles might be there.
- Syd know this?
- No.
He's been in nonstop meetings
all day in the Tower.
Get him.
He'll drop it forJarod.
We're out of here.
Floyd's holding an empty barber chair
for you, Broots. What's the problem?
Well, see-
[Clears Throat]
This is where your father's
secrets come in.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Centre travel records.</i>
<i>My father already sent Bridget.</i>
<i>[Woman On TV] The cause</i>
<i>of this bizarre crash is still undetermined.</i>
However, several eyewitnesses who I spoke to
here at the Osborne Flight School...
indicated that they heard
a small explosive sound-
Jarod's father is not dead.
[Woman]
Dead on the scene is the pilot, Dan Wilson.
[Groans]
I'd be sick to my stomach too.
Excuse me.
Here I go again.
<i>[Sighs]</i>
<i>Morning sickness.</i>
Hell of a price to pay
for an heir.
<i>No Sweeper team, no backup.</i>
No follow-through.
Heirs have disappeared around here
for a hell of a lot less.
- That's enough, angel.
- No. Not enough, Daddy.
<i>You sent a rank amateur...</i>
to do a job you knew
I wanted myself.
<i>We're talking about</i>
<i>the man who killed Mom...</i>
and you didn't trust me.
Shame on you.
<i>[Carrie's Voice]</i>
<i>To fathers.</i>
To fathers.
You know, the last time
I talked to my dad...
he mentioned seeing an old friend
who had recently arrived in the Arctic.
- My dad.
- Mm-hmm.
He admired your dad
a lot, Jarod.
<i>His courage and tenacity.</i>
They were workin' together toward
exposing the research being done up there.
<i>God, I just wish he could have</i>
<i>finished what he started.</i>
<i>Carrie...
<i>your father's death</i>
<i>won't be in vain.</i>
I promise you.
<i>But in order to stop</i>
<i>what's going on...</i>
<i>I have to find my father</i>
<i>and help him.</i>
Did he say anything while he was here
that could help me?
He spent most of his time reading files
and working on his laptop.
Most of all
he loved to fly though.
<i>He said it was</i>
<i>his one release.</i>
Sure left here in a hurry.
Mm-hmm. He rushed back from town,
said some strangers were askin' about him.
<i>He said hejust had this gut feeling</i>
<i>that it was time to go.</i>
<i>And then he made me promise</i>
<i>to ditch his car.</i>
You have his car?
- <i>Find something?</i>
- Yes. The one with nothing.
<i>And a phone number.</i>
[Sighs]
[Beeping]
[Line Rings]
[Woman]
Pakor Frozen Foods is closed.
Our office hours
are 8:00 a.m. To 5:00-
- [Beeps]
- What'd you find?
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Hopefully...</i>
my father.
<i>[Miss Parker] Sydney, what do you mean</i>
<i>you're not going to North Carolina?</i>
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>New duties beckon.</i>
Since when isn'tJarod
a priority one for you?
I'd love to wax philosophical...
but right now I'm busy.
And you have a trip to take.
[Chuckles]
I'll call you
from North Carolina.
Good luck with
your new duties, Syd.
<i>[Mr. Parker's Voice]</i>
<i>I do have an office, you know.</i>
<i>Gemini.</i>
Gemini is not something two people
chat about at a urinal on SL 10.
Gemini?
There are very few secrets,
Mr. Parker.
Unfortunately,
that's a fact.
[Clears Throat]
What do you want, Sydney?
I want Gemini.
<i>If it is the reality</i>
<i>I know it to be...</i>
I want to be
project coordinator.
Raines might give you
an argument about that.
Not even Raines can deny
that I am the most qualified.
- There are younger people.
- And how many haveJarod on their résumé?
Very good point.
I'll think on it.
<i>Sydney, let me ask you something.</i>
<i>LfJarod were still at the Centre...</i>
would you be making
this pitch to run Gemini?
LfJarod were still
at the Centre...
there'd be no need
for Gemini.
Don't look so scared, sweetie.
I'm only twice as mean as I look.
Well, it takes a hell of a lot more
than high heels to scare me, Miss-
And you're sure
Jarod's already left town?
Look, like I said, I kicked his butt
when I saw him sleeping in there.
All right? All he said was
somethin' about headin' down to Florida.
Thank you for your time.
- <i>So, south, Miss Parker?</i>
- She's lying. We're heading north.
<i>[Man On Speaker]</i>
<i>This is Mark in Sector 7.</i>
<i>All clear here. Over.</i>
<i>[Man #2]</i>
<i>Roger that. Checking hallway.</i>
- <i>Security breach in East Wing.</i>
- <i>[Alarm Blaring]</i>
[Grunts]
Oh, my... God in heaven.
It's you!
Dad!
Let me look at you.
Look at you.
It's been so long.
- It's you!
- Dad!
Ah. They found each other.
The question is
what else did they find?
Jarod's father
hit the jackpot.
He got into the data bank
and made off with several disks.
- The embryo disks.
- [Groans]
<i>[Mr. Parker] Then it won't be long</i>
<i>till they find out about Donoterase.</i>
- I'm gonna have to tell Big Mutumbo something.
- <i>[Raines] If I were you...</i>
I'd come clean about
the Centre mistakes...
and hope for benevolence
from Mutumbo.
Tell him everything's
moving along swimmingly...
and we look forward
to his visit.
When in doubt, lie.
Sweetheart.
You go find Jarod
and his father, hmm?
Raines, call Donoterase.
<i>We transfer Gemini</i>
<i>in 24 hours.</i>
<i>[Major Charles]</i>
<i>Doesn't look like much, but we should be safe here.</i>
Looks like all the places
that I've hid out in over the years.
Like father like son.
For years I would
lie awake at night...
wondering what
you would be like...
what you would look like.
<i>But all those sleepless nights wouldn't</i>
<i>prepare me for how nervous I feel right now.</i>
I've missed you so much.
<i>The first few weeks</i>
<i>after you were kidnapped...</i>
we got by on hope
and prayers alone.
<i>Then it wasn't long</i>
<i>before I realized...</i>
that if we were gonna find you,
we'd have to find you ourselves.
And all that time
running for your lives.
Yeah. It seemed that...
everywhere we turned was just
another place to run from Sweepers.
<i>I know the feeling.</i>
But bein' here with you now
makes all that pain go away.
- <i>[Chuckles]</i>
- I really want to see Mom and Emily.
So do I.
<i>I've been searching</i>
<i>for your mother and sister...</i>
almost as long as
I've been lookin' for you.
In an attempt to rescue you, l-
I was separated from them.
What happened?
A woman named Catherine Parker
tried to help...
<i>but things went wrong.</i>
<i>The Centre came after me.</i>
<i>And when it was safe, I went back.</i>
But your mother and Emily
were gone.
I don't even know
if they're still alive.
But they are.
I saw them...
two years ago.
Thank God.
We'll find them together.
There's something else.
Kyle.
- He's, uh-
- Yeah. I know, Son. I heard.
I came upon that little town about two days
after your brother was gunned down.
But I'm proud of you, Son.
It's amazing after all
you've been through...
that you still have
the compassion to help others.
I wish I could take
some credit...
for your upbringing-
that I could have
been there with you.
There's some-
something I have to ask you.
Something I was told
and I don't want to believe.
What is it?
Did you kill
<i>Catherine Parker?
What do you think?
<i>[Broots] Donoterase.</i>
<i>Does that name mean anything to you?</i>
Sounds like
an Italian mime troupe.
I was down in
the communications room last night...
and I intercepted a call from Raines
to a place called Donoterase.
Now he said your dad ordered that Gemini
be transferred from there in 24 hours.
- Any clue where Donoterase is?
- Well, I'm working on it.
Now this is their surveillance footage
from Jarod and his Dad.
<i>Besides finding Jarod,</i>
<i>Major Charles also stole some data disks.</i>
And he didn't seem to mind
who saw him do it either.
Any man who'd walk into the Centre and shoot
my mother has the brass ones to do that.
Any way to find out what was
on those disks he lifted?
Well, I'm running an anonymous
sequencing search right now.
- This is a Centre facility?
- <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>And the footage comes from a well-buried</i>
<i>Centre location in Baltimore.</i>
Uh- [Clears Throat]
Bearded...
- <i>by the name of Pakor Frozen Foods.</i>
- Pakor.
<i>My mother referred to that name in the memo</i>
<i>that she wrote about Project Gemini.</i>
<i>Exactly. But why would Jarod's father</i>
<i>be interested in Gemini?</i>
- And what does this have to do with your mother?
- I wish I knew.
- <i>[Computer Beeps]</i>
- What?
Data from the disks he stole.
Broots.
Succotash isn't the only thing
frozen in there.
What kind of nightmare
is this?
[Muttering]
Hey. Wake up. Hey.
It's okay.
You're just havin' a bad dream.
I'm sorry. L-
<i>I've never been much of</i>
<i>a sound sleeper.</i>
Well, what I found
probably won't help.
I broke the code on
one of the disks I stole.
The Centre's
outdoing themselves.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Pakor Frozen Foods is a biological storage facility.</i>
<i>[Major Charles]</i>
<i>Body parts, fetal tissue.</i>
<i>Cows, sheep, horses.</i>
<i>You name it.</i>
<i>It's Old MacDonald's farm from hell.</i>
<i>And Old MacDonald.</i>
<i>There's human embryos.</i>
- Oh, God.
- What is it?
Ayear ago...
I went searching for my past,
and it led me to...
the fertility clinic that
you and Mom went to to get pregnant.
<i>I found out that it was</i>
<i>owned by the Centre.</i>
My God.
The doctors took
your mother's eggs.
My guess is the Centre has them on ice
somewhere at Pakor Frozen Foods.
Gemini.
I don't know what it all means,
but it's all happening at a place called Donoterase.
<i>[Miss Parker's Voice]</i>
<i>You found Donoterase?</i>
Yeah. And one thing's for sure.
The Centre didn't want anybody to know about it.
It's only about 15 miles from here. That's where
they're gonna transfer the Gemini from.
And if we figured it out,
so haveJarod and his old man.
<i>[Major Charles]</i>
<i>The Centre database was specific on this location...</i>
- <i>but there's nothing here.</i>
- <i>[Jarod] That's what they want people to believe.</i>
<i>[Cow Moos]</i>
- [Jarod] This is Donoterase?
- I don't get it.
- <i>What is it?</i>
- Tire tracks.
- Dual rear wheels.
- <i>Transportation vehicles.</i>
The question is
what are they transporting...
and where is it going?
<i>Hey. What are you</i>
<i>doing here?</i>
[Groans]
I'm not as old as you think.
<i>[Monkey Chitters]</i>
<i>[Chicken Clucking]</i>
<i>[Sheep Bleats]</i>
- <i>[Chicken Squawking]</i>
- <i>[Coos]</i>
<i>[Sheep Bleats]</i>
<i>[Major Charles]</i>
<i>What do you think Old MacDonald's up to?</i>
[Wheels Squeaking]
Time to transport him.
What are you doing here?
Did you really think you could
keep me from finding out about Gemini?
<i>Let me tell you</i>
<i>a little secret about myself.</i>
I love to be underestimated.
So, are you gonna tell me what's goin' on here,
or are we gonna do this dance?
<i>[Footsteps Approaching]</i>
<i>[Sheep Bleats]</i>
<i>[Monkey Chittering]</i>
<i>What are they?</i>
Designer livestock.
Hey! What are you guys
doin' in here?
- Hey!
- <i>[Alarm Blaring]</i>
[Gasps]
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Get 'em!
[Groans]
Move! Move!
[Groaning]
<i>[Alarm Continues]</i>
You all right? Who was that boy?
You looked like you saw a ghost.
Not a ghost.
That boy is me.
They cloned me!
Let me help you. I'm just gonna put
a field dressing on it.
Then when we get somewhere safe,
I'm gonna clean and re-dress it.
- Where we headed?
- <i>As far from the Centre as possible.</i>
- We have to go back.
- No, Jarod. You're hurt.
I'm fine.
We have to go back.
No. I've been searching all my life
for the family the Centre took from me.
And after all these years,
I'm reunited with my son.
I'm not about to risk
losing you again.
This isn't about me.
It's about him.
I don't know who
or what he is.
He's a boy.
And he's part of us.
I've known the Centre to do
some unspeakable things...
but to create a child-
How were they even
able to do it?
Years ago, they asked me to perform
a cloning simulation.
A cell containing the D.N.A. Blueprint
of the desired organism...
is fused into a host ovum.
The newly fertilized egg
develops into an embryo...
and then it's implanted
inside a surrogate mother.
That's why they had
your mother's frozen egg cells.
They implanted my D.N.A. Into her egg,
knowing that it wouldn't reject it.
- It should never have happened.
- But it did.
Regardless of how that boy
came into this world...
he is here,
and he is our family.
We can't let the Centre possess him
like they possessed me.
We need help from the inside.
Do you know anyone
in the Centre you can trust?
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>
This is Sydney.
Please tell me that you had
nothing to do with this.
- With what?
- They took my genetic material...
and like I was some kind of farm animal,
they cloned me.
There were rumors,
of course, but...
- <i>I didn't want to believe them.</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Well, believe it.</i>
I saw him.
I saw me.
It was like looking into a mirror,
only the reflection was 20 years younger.
My God.
This is beyond words.
Sydney, you're the only person
at the Centre we can trust.
Please help me.
- I'll do what I can.
- [Beeps]
[Dial Tone, Beeps]
- <i>[Mr. Lyle] He's magnificent.</i>
- <i>[Mr. Parker] Well, he's a little nervous.</i>
<i>He's never been</i>
<i>outside of Donoterase.</i>
<i>No wonder secrecy has always</i>
<i>been the key to Gemini.</i>
And no wonder Mother
was against it.
- Angel.
- Don't angel me.
- They all knew about this, and I didn't.
- It was a Triumvirate directive.
Eyes only. Hell, I've only known about it
a little while myself.
He is an amazing specimen
though, isn't he?
Is there no depth
to which we won't sink?
- What's bothering you?
- You let Raines play God.
<i>Your father doesn't</i>
let me <i>do anything.</i>
<i>Gemini has always been mine.</i>
- <i>[Wheels Squeaking]</i>
- Gene manipulation, cloning-
It's the cutting edge
of technology.
<i>Welcome to the new millennium,</i>
<i>Miss Parker.</i>
We're 20 years ahead of the sheep cloners
we hear about on the news.
<i>[Mr. Parker] We're producing</i>
<i>the finest beef at our place in Argentina.</i>
Each one designed to be exactly the same.
Now that is progress.
Daddy, Raines didn't design
a better Big Mac.
<i>He designed a human being.</i>
Oh, my God.
He is young Jarod.
<i>Sydney, don't tell me</i>
<i>you knew about this too.</i>
Only four of us
knew about this.
And Mutumbo's people
at the Triumvirate.
Sydney, I've been thinking
about your request...
<i>and, uh,</i>
<i>we're gonna do it.</i>
- I'm overwhelmed, sir. Thank you.
- <i>[Wheels Squeaking]</i>
What request?
<i>I'm making Sydney project</i>
<i>coordinator on Gemini.</i>
<i>And I want him to find out</i>
<i>how he compares to the original Jarod.</i>
There's no way he's going to
test <i>my</i> Pretender.
The boy doesn't belong to you, Raines.
He belongs to the Triumvirate.
<i>And before we deliver him,</i>
<i>I want a performance comparison...</i>
done by the man who knows
more aboutJarod than anybody else!
[Whispers]
Sydney, you're not really gonna participate in this.
Parker, please.
My name is Sydney.
I'll be taking care of you
for a while.
<i>[Jarod's Voice]</i>
<i>What is this place?</i>
<i>[Major Charles]</i>
<i>An old hunting shack.</i>
<i>You, me and your mom were</i>
<i>campin'near here when you were a boy.</i>
A big storm came up
and washed out the road.
We had to take shelter here
till it blew over.
That's funny.
- I don't remember.
- I didn't see it before, but it's still here.
- What?
- The scar.
You were entertaining
your mom.
You climbed up on that ladder, tryin' to
take her mind off the storm, and fell.
You cut your back.
It was just the three of us
for two days.
It was like we were
the only people in the world.
It was only about a week
before the-
The Centre took me.
Jarod.
<i>Catherine Parker told me
some things.
Some awful things happened
to you at the Centre.
- Doesn't matter now.
- It matters to me.
What did they do to you?
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>I can't do it, Sydney! I can't figure it out!</i>
- You have to.
- How much oxygen is left?
- Less than 48 hours.
- What caused the explosion?
We don't know.
- Fuel?
- You've shut down your gauges.
Data is sketchy,
but little.
- Oxygen?
- You've asked that already.
- Now focus!
- There's nothing that can save us.
It is your job.
It is your duty to save your crew!
- No. I can't do it.
- Of course you can!
Shut down now,
and we all die.
- You too!
- Wait a minute.
<i>I can use the gravitational pull</i>
<i>of the moon to help get us back.</i>
- Pretty good.
- I knew you'd save us all if you wanted to.
- He did well.
- <i>[Raines] Eighty-five seconds quicker...</i>
than Jarod's record
doing the same sim.
<i>[Sydney] But factoring in the technological</i>
<i>awareness available to the boy...</i>
his accomplishment
only just matches Jarod's.
<i>Either way,</i>
<i>it certainly proves his capabilities.</i>
I can't wait to
show him to Mutumbo.
You sound like horse trainers talking about
your prized three-year-old.
<i>[Brigitte]</i>
<i>Another one of your morality issues?</i>
- Like you'd know anything about morality.
- Oh, Miss Parker.
No. Sydney, don't you
even talk to me.
I can't believe you'd even
participate in this.
What is it? A chance to relive
the twisted experiments of your youth?
<i>You know what they must have done</i>
<i>to create that boy.</i>
<i>Do you want your experiment back so badly</i>
<i>that you'd take his replicant instead?</i>
[Whispers]
Miss Parker, you don't understand.
You're right.
I hope I never do.
<i>[Raines]</i>
<i>His inception was flawless.</i>
I even think your mother would have
agreed that the entire Project Gemini...
<i>has been run</i>
<i>completely aboveboard.</i>
<i>[Miss Parker's Voice]</i>
<i>Aboveboard, my cute little ass.</i>
- I don't really feel comfortable
discussing that subject.
- Cloning?
No. Your cute little-
<i>Yes.</i> Cloning.
And I can't believe Sydney
would be involved in this mess.
- Yeah, well, nothing around this
nuthouse surprises me anymore.
- You could say that twice.
Well, they didn't keep Gemini from me
because there was nothing to hide.
I'm gonna find out the truth-
what really happened.
And I guess I'm gonna
help you. Hmm?
You bet your cute little ass.
<i>[Sheep Bleating]</i>
<i>[Broots] I rerouted the sensors,</i>
<i>so we should have a halfhour...</i>
before anyone finds out
we're down here.
[Miss Parker]
Since we don't have much time...
- why don't you keep your eyes
open and your mouth shut?
- That's fine with me.
'Cause I don't want to
be down here anyhow.
<i>Check it out.
<i>This must be</i>
<i>where they kept him.</i>
Wow.
<i>Not much of a place to spend</i>
<i>the first 14 years of your life, is it?</i>
Nice view.
<i>Miss Parker.</i>
<i>Over here.</i>
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>"Specimen Anomalies Dissection Storage."</i>
<i>What does that</i>
<i>sound like to you?</i>
Oh, a freak show
I don't want any part of.
What's that smell?
Formaldehyde.
Oh, that's never a good sign.
Oh, God.
What are they?
Oh, l- I think
they're the "befores."
- Before what?
- <i>Before they figured out what they were doing.</i>
The same thing happened with
the early cloning of sheep and other mammals.
They didn't just re-create
Dolly the Sheep after the first try.
She was, like, the 375th.
What happened to
the first 374?
They ended up like this.
Mutations.
Only they weren't human.
Oh, look at this.
It's got the body of a boy
and a face <i>like...</i> Colonel Sanders.
It's called progeria. It's a genetic defect
that causes accelerated aging in children.
They can be seven years old,
but their bodies are a hundred.
- Oh, no.
- [Clangs]
- [Gasps]
- Broots!
I'm sorry. Ew!
Look at this place.
Raines was playing God.
And he unleashed the devil.
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>No. No.</i>
No.
No. Please.
<i>No. Please. No.</i>
What did they do to you?
I can't open the hatch!
I can't open the hatch!
It's too hot! L- I can't think!
I'm burning!
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>I can save him!</i>
- No!
- This is your last chance.
I did tell the truth.
I'm at peace.
I feel tired.
My legs hurt.
I set myself on fire because
I'm convinced it'll send a message, Sydney.
<i>[Young Sydney] It's been three days, Jarod,</i>
<i>with temperatures over a hundred degrees.</i>
- <i>All you have to do is submit.</i>
- It's not for me.
- I'll never give up.
- <i>[Jarod] It's not your fault.</i>
<i>[Sighs]</i>
- But-
- We're together now.
That's all that matters.
<i>That...</i>
and saving the boy.
<i>[Computer Twitters]</i>
<i>[Major Charles]</i>
<i>I'm into the Centre's mainframe.</i>
<i>Damn! They're onto me.</i>
But I'm into Gemini.
They're transferring the boy
to the Triumvirate.
- When are they going to transfer him?
- <i>I don't know.</i>
Damn it! They've shut me out. There's gotta be
some other way we can find out.
Someone who can tell us.
[Beeps]
[Ringing]
[Ringing Continues]
- [Line Ringing]
- Come on, Sydney. Answer the phone.
- Are you going to answer it, or shall I?
- [Ringing Continues]
- It's not important.
- [Beeps]
<i>What we have to say is.</i>
The timetable on the transfer
of our young Pretender has been moved up.
He goes at dawn.
My work won't be completed.
It can't be avoided.
The mainframe's been compromised...
and we suspect
Jarod and Major Charles.
My father says you can continue your work
with the boy once he's been transferred.
We expect
your full cooperation.
You have that.
<i>[Miss Parker's Voice]</i>
<i>"I vehemently disagree...</i>
<i>"with Dr. Raines's conclusions</i>
<i>about Gemini...</i>
<i>"and despite some humane</i>
<i>advances being made at Pakor...</i>
<i>"I cannot in good conscience endorse</i>

<i>"While it represents a potentially major</i>

<i>"one must wonder if mankind is</i>

<i>Catherine Parker. "
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
[Exhales Sharply]
You got anything to drink?
Preferably something that burns.
Need to cleanse
your palate?
No. My soul.
I backtracked the cloning records
from Donoterase.
<i>Over the years, they fertilized 289 ova</i>
<i>before they were successful with the boy.</i>
The results of which
we saw at the specimen lab.
Well-
[Clears Throat]
Some of them.
[Coughs]
And if you can believe it...
that sideshow wasn't
the weirdest part of the circus.
<i>They couldn'tjust grow those ova</i>
<i>in an incubator.</i>
- They needed donor wombs.
- Surrogate mothers.
Seems Raines found
the women himself.
<i>Mostly disenfranchised,</i>
<i>homeless, loners or coma victims.</i>
Women who wouldn't be missed
if there were complications.
And-And believe me,
there were plenty of them.
Most fetuses
never reached term.
And-And...
the ones that did-
Well, they didn't even
make it through-
- Childbirth.
- <i>[Scoffs] Well, if you-</i>
<i>if you could call it that.</i>
<i>All of the surrogates who made it that far,</i>
<i>though, they- theyjust-</i>
- Disappeared.
- Without a trace.
That's what my mother was talking-
talking about in this Gemini memo.
What she feared
could happen at Donoterase.
What should I do?
Well, whatever it is, you better decide pretty
quickly, because they're moving the boy at dawn.
Where?
Triumvirate station, Africa.
Your mom's first priority was the children.
What would she do?
The same thing
she was trying to do when...
she was killed:
Rescue the children.
I'm over here.
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear you come in.
<i>Do you want me</i>
<i>to do something for you?</i>
No.
I just came to talk.
Talk? You don't want anything?
Just to see you.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.
Ready to work.
- You were crying.
- No, I wasn't.
L- I just-
Don't tell Mr. Raines.
He gets angry if I show any emotion.
It won't happen again. I promise.
It's okay to cry.
No, it's not.
Not for me.
I'm here to serve-
to do what I'm told.
Is that what
Raines taught you?
Yes.
That I have been gifted with the intelligence
designed to help others.
<i>Mr. Raines says emotions</i>
<i>get in the way.</i>
If you don't want me to work,
then why are you here?
When I was your age,
I knew a boy just like you.
Exactly like you.
<i>I felt for him...</i>
but I never let him know.
I saw...
pain... in his eyes...
but I looked the other way.
<i>I see the same pain</i>
<i>in your eyes.</i>
But I can't look away anymore.
I don't understand.
Do you want to be here,
or do you want to do what other kids do?
What do other kids do?
Play. Have fun.
<i>Experience life.</i>
- Is this a simulation?
- No. No. This is real.
I'm doing what I want to do:
Sims to help others.
Then why were you crying?
L- I wasn't.
I just-
It's okay.
It's okay.
If Mr. Raines finds out,
he'll get angry.
And when he gets
angry, he-
He-
- He-
- I won't let him hurt you anymore. I promise.
Now we gotta
get you out of here.
<i>He's not going anywhere</i>
<i>with you.</i>
<i>[Miss Parker's Voice]</i>
<i>I can't believe this, Sydney.</i>
You're going with them.
- Yes.
- Sydney, why?
- You too, Broots?
- You certainly fooled me for the last three years...
bumbling around the globe
like a benevolent Dr. Spock...
when you're really
a, uh, psycho Dr. Mengele.
You don't know
what you're saying.
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>
It's your original lab rat.
- What are you gonna tell him?
- <i>[Ringing Continues]</i>
- [Beeps]
- Sydney.
They're going to move the boy.
I need to know when.
I can't help you anymore.
Sydney, I need
your help. Please.
<i>[Wheels Squeaking]</i>
<i>And another excursion into</i>
<i>the mainframe would be useless.</i>
There is no refuge
for you anymore.
[Beeps]
He hung up.
[Beeps]
He's helping them.
What did he say?
He said that another excursion
into the mainframe would be useless.
Why would he tell us
where not to look?
Because someone else
was there.
It was his way of telling us
where to look.
He said the mainframe
was useless.
There would be
no..."refuge."
I knew I could
trust you, Sydney.
- Straight to the airstrip. No stops.
- <i>[Engine Starts]</i>
<i>The transfer plane is meeting us</i>
<i>just after first light.</i>
<i>[Car Engine Starts]</i>
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What the hell is goin' on?
Let's go, junior.
We got places to be.
[Coughing]
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Miss Parker, what's goin'on?</i>
Jarod.
<i>[Car Approaching]</i>
- Miss Parker.
- Get him in the truck!
- Where are you going?
- Just get him out of here now!
Get in.
- <i>[Engine Cranking]</i>
- Get out!
Dad.
- <i>[Coughing]</i>
- Oh! Damn!
Who are you?
I'm you.
[Angry Chattering]
- You were the problem.
- You need to get off my back.
[Chattering Continues]
<i>[Clanging]</i>
<i>Carelessness...
leads to chaos...
<i>chaos to anarchy...</i>
anarchy to ruin.
This is the Centre.
<i>Ruin... is not an option!</i>
- Mutumbo, if I may-
- Excuses are only yesterday's failures.
<i>Only solutions matter now.</i>
Mutumbo, we all-we all want
the same thing here: The boy and Jarod back.
I am listening.
So we fumbled the kid.
We intercepted Jarod's father.
He's our trump card.
- <i>Let's play him.</i>
- <i>[Miss Parker] And I guarantee you, sir.</i>
You give me 10 minutes
with Major Charles...
and I'll have every answer you want
about whereJarod and the boy are.
Brigitte will handle
Major Charles.
Thank you.
If I may, sir-
<i>You will honor my wishes.</i>
Good answer.
In the meantime,
we haveJarod and the boy to track down.
Mr. Lyle will lead that effort.
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Sir, with the possible exception of Sydney...</i>
<i>I knowJarod</i>
<i>better than anyone here...</i>
and he will not allow
that boy to be captured.
Yes. But what you are
forgetting is the boy himself.
He wasn't raised to cooperate.
Especially with Jarod.
I'm just saying it's a waste of manpower
and money to go afterJarod...
when the key to it all is the man
sitting down in Renewal Wing.
- Daddy.
- Well, uh, Mutumbo has a good
plan here. We need to follow it.
<i>[Mutumbo]</i>
<i>Then it is settled. Two points of attack.</i>
Two generals, one plan.
[Wheels Squeaking]
<i>[Chattering]</i>
Now I know what
dirty laundry feels like.
- Not here, angel.
- Yes, here.
How could you just stand there
while Mutumbo shut me out?
For God's sake,
we're talkin' the Triumvirate here.
Every action, every thought,
every word I utter could be a death sentence.
We both know I'm the one who should be
down there with Major Charles.
And we both know sometimes
I have to play things the way I play things...
whether you like it or not.
"Play." Oh, my God.
We're talking about
the man who killed Mom.
We're talking about our family.
I'm talking about survival.
The things I do,
choices I make...
you probably never will
understand.
Tell me, Daddy. Are you
really afraid of Mutumbo...
or what I may find out
from Major Charles?
[Elevator Bell Dings]
I thought I was off
your Christmas card list.
You were.
Until our nosy little bald friend Broots
confirmed my suspicions with this.
<i>You left e-mail forJarod</i>
<i>in a box called "refuge."</i>
You let him know when
and where to find the boy.
I had you pegged for
the wrong witch in Oz, Sydney.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
I'm sorry I wasn't able to confide in you.
Or in Broots either.
Human cloning- I... don't think
I probably would have believed you anyway.
When I went down to talk
with the boy, it was, um-
It was so surreal
being with him.
It was like I was suddenly
11 years old again.
And yet-
And yet?
And yet the boy is Jarod...
in every way except
the most important one.
He doesn't have
Jarod's soul.
And he didn't have you.
Miss Parker.
When I found out
they had made anotherJarod...
I knew that if I didn't
take control...
something important
would be lost.
If facing Major Charles
is important enough to you...
then go.
Take it.
And everyone else be damned.
<i>[Thunderclap]</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Must be some matches around here somewhere.</i>
Aha. Yes.
Little light in here.
There we go.
<i>[Thunder Rumbling]</i>
You cold?
It's probably too damp out there
to hunt for firewood...
but maybe I can break up
some of these old chairs.
I don't understand.
Why are you so afraid of me?
- Is this a bad man?
- [Raines] Very bad.
- What did he do?
- [Wheels Squeaking]
This is the man
who killed your parents.
<i>How can one feed</i>
<i>such a terrible lie to a child?</i>
Raines could feed candy
to a diabetic and sleep like a baby.
He doesn't seem
like a killer.
<i>He seems sad,</i>
<i>Mr. Raines.</i>
Like there's this void in his life
that's depriving him of any true happiness.
<i>Perhaps loss of a loved one.</i>
Or the loss of family.
<i>Maybe he feels</i>
<i>the same way I do...</i>
not knowing who he is
or where he came from.
You're not concentrating.
He's no different
from any of the others.
I don't know.
I just-
I feel I have
a connection with him.
- This boy's good.
- Mmm. Almost as good as the real thing.
Wait a minute.
What am I saying?
He is the real thing.
<i>[Raines]</i>
<i>If you can't find him...</i>
he'll go out and kill
another little boy's parents...
just like he killed yours.
<i>Do you understand me?</i>
<i>Good.</i>
<i>[Jarod] I swear to you I had nothing</i>
<i>to do with the death of your-</i>
<i>[Thunder Rumbles]</i>
Of your parents.
- Then what happened to them?
- It's complicated.
You're a gifted young man.
You have the ability to grasp
difficult concepts.
When I was a boy I used to look
in the mirror and think about my past...
try to picture my future.
- Do you ever do that?
- Yes.
But I can't see a past.
When I was a boy...
I was stolen
from my parents...
and I was held prisoner
at the Centre.
<i>[Thunderclap]</i>
They exploited my mind.
They made me do things.
Things I never
should have done.
The same kind of things
that they made you do.
When I got older, I realized that
they were using these things to hurt people.
Even to kill them.
So I ran away.
You escaped.
<i>Yes. But not all of me.</i>
They kept part of me behind.
Some of my-
Some of my D.N.A.
<i>I guess they had a plan.</i>
A way to always
keep me prisoner.
I don't understand.
I think you do.
<i>If you could look into that</i>
<i>mirror and see your future...</i>
it would look
exactly like...
me.
But my parents.
They don't exist.
<i>They never did.</i>
<i>At least not in the way</i>
<i>you were taught.</i>
No. You're lying.
<i>Mr. Raines said you were clever.</i>
<i>You're lying.</i>
I wish to God I was.
<i>But I'm not lying.</i>
I'm sorry.
I want to
show you something.
<i>That's me</i>
<i>when I was your age.</i>
[Young Jarod]
No. I can't do it!
- [Young Sydney] You shut down now, you all die!
- I'm you?
- I come from nowhere?
- <i>You come from here.</i>
And I come from two people
who love me very much.
<i>[Thunder Rumbling]</i>
It's okay to cry.
I can't.
Mr. Raines won't let me.
<i>[Thunderclap]</i>
- <i>[Young Miss Parker Screams]</i>
- <i>[Young Sydney] No! Keep her back!</i>
- Keep her back.
- [Young Jarod] Leave me alone!
<i>[Young Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Mama! [Sobbing]</i>
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
<i>[Door Closes]</i>
<i>[Water Dripping]</i>
You can beat me
all you want.
I'd rather die
than give up my son.
You're going to die,
but it's not about your son.
It's about my mother.
You look just like her.
You should know.
You killed her.
That's my gun.
The one you used
to shoot her.
No.
It's the one a man named Raines stole
from me the day your mother was killed.
She knew trouble was coming.
[Chuckles]
Why should I believe that?
Because it's true.
It was the day I was supposed to help her
rescueJarod and two other children.
Raines shot me,
left me for dead...
took my gun.
I still carry the bullet
in my back.
You bought yourself another second.
Talk fast.
Your mother located me.
She knew I was
searching forJarod.
She was afraid of something
called the Triumvirate.
She said we'd have to
move fast-
that this Triumvirate
threatened her husband...
because of her action
to rescue the children...
and her opposition to
something she called Gemini.
- They threatened Daddy?
- They threatened his wife and his daughter.
You were the other child
we were trying to rescue.
Your mother was gonna take you
to Europe the next day.
Don't you remember?
My father knew about these rescues?
<i>My</i> rescue?
That was how I saw it.
But I can't be certain.
<i>But I do know for sure...</i>
your mother was scared
for your safety and his.
<i>Afraid ofhow</i>
<i>the Triumvirate controlled him.</i>
Raines was the Triumvirate
watchdog then.
He's still howling.
<i>I didn't understand why he took my gun</i>
<i>all those years ago, but I do now.</i>
All your mother and father
ever wanted was what I wanted:
To love
and be with our children.
- <i>[Birds Chirping]</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Good morning.</i>
- <i>[Birds Chirping]</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Good morning.</i>
Breakfast.
That isn't wheat grass
and tomato juice.
No. That's what they feed you.
It's called ice cream.
You'll never forget the first bite.
Go ahead. Try it.
Go ahead.
- [Chuckles]
- Mmm.
It's very good.
There are so many incredible
things in the world to try.
Hope they're all
as good as ice cream.
So, what are we
gonna do now?
Right now I have to
figure out a way to get my-
<i>our</i> father out of the Centre.
Maybe we should trade them
for something just as important.
I can't believe I doubted him.
All these years.
All these years I've- I've wondered
why Daddy hid things from me...
lied to me, dissuaded me
from digging into her past...
but it was all for my own good.
We all want to believe that our parents
have our best interests in mind. But-
I finally find some peace of mind,
and you want to lobotomize it?
Isn't there an apparent conflict
between your newfound joy...
and your loading
of this weapon?
It's very simple.
Raines dead...
me happy.
Not an easy man to kill.
<i>Can't help it
if you're a lousy aim.
I don't plan to miss.
Miss Parker.
Y-You both.
- You gotta come quick- to the lobby.
- Later, Broots.
Oh, no, no, no. Trust me.
You're not gonna believe this.
- [Elevator Bell Dings]
- He's right here.
Move.
Remember me?
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Where'd you find him?</i>
[Sam]
We didn't.
He came in on his own.
Three years on the run, and it's finally
homesickness that brings you back.
Well, actually,
I came to cut a deal.
<i>Broots, go get my father.</i>
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Oh, he's not in his office.</i>
What kind of game is this?
It's a simple one. You'll get
your father back...
when I get mine.
So you're proposing
an equal trade.
Your father for my husband.
I wouldn't say that it was
equal, but it will do. Yes.
And how do we know
you're not bluffing?
<i>[Gun Cocks]</i>
Seeing is believing.
<i>I'll call you in two hours</i>
<i>to arrange the exchange.</i>
<i>One of you will bring me</i>
<i>my father.</i>
- Only one.
- That'd be me.
That'd be Sydney.
<i>Sydney? This is my father</i>
<i>we're talking about.</i>
<i>Our</i> father.
All the more reason
to keep cool heads.
Sydney's the only person I can trust
to play by the rules.
- Where will the exchange take place, Jarod?
- Like I said, I'll call you.
I wouldn't want anybody showing up early
and complicating things.
I really have to go now.
Do you want to see
your father again?
Alive?
- <i>[Wheels Squeaking]</i>
- <i>And you letJarod walk right out?</i>
He has my father!
And we had him!
I made the only move there was,
you son of a bitch!
It was your last one,
Miss Parker.
The Centre's
chain of command is clear.
As long as
Mr. Parker is absent...
Mr. Raines is in charge.
<i>And your plan is,</i>
<i>Mr. Raines?</i>
We organize two Sweeper teams.
<i>Once we know the location,</i>
<i>one will scout and secure-</i>
[Wheezing]
And the other will execute.
No. No. No.
You're gambling
with my father's life.
We do this just as Jarod said.
<i>Well, Raines's experience</i>
<i>with Jarod is just administrative.</i>
Look...
- I know how this guy's mind works.
- This is not a democracy.
My decision stands.
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- Jarod.
- <i>[Jarod] Interstate Road 40.</i>
Iversonville,
North Carolina. At 3:00.
<i>Not 2.59. Not 3.01.</i>
3:00.
- That barely gives enough time for Sydney to-
- Then he'd better get moving.
Jarod, I want to
talk to my father.
- Daddy, are you there?
- [Beeps]
Sydney, go.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
- Get Major Charles.
Let's move.
[Wheels Squeaking]
Like I said, two teams.
[Wheezing]
And I'll need our best sharpshooter.
I'm your man.
Jarod will not walk away from this.
No. I wantJarod alive.
And the boy too.
It's Mr. Parker who's outlived
his usefulness.
That waste of skin Raines
is gonna get my father killed.
Well, I don't thinkJarod would hurt your father.
I don't think.
Jarod's been searching for his father
his entire life...
and he's gonna do
whatever it takes to get him back.
I could see it
in his eyes.
- Well, then what do you think we should do?
- Same thing. Whatever it takes.
Miss Parker.
Jarod isn't
the only enemy this time.
Don't worry, Bridget.
I wouldn't forget about you.
I know what you think of me...
but believe me, we both want
the same thing this time.
Mr. Raines is planning
to kill your father.
Why should I believe you?
Because if you don't, somebody we both love
very much is going to die.
With or without you,
I'm going.
Let's do this together.
Please.
[Major Charles]
I'd like to thank you, Sydney.
- What for?
- For raising my son.
What he's become
is a reflection of you.
What was he like as a child?
Someone a father would feel
very proud to call his son.
<i>I'm sorry you never</i>
<i>had that chance, Major.</i>
In fact, I can't imagine
anything worse...
than what
you've had to endure.
I can.
- Not ever finding him at all.
- <i>[Jarod On Walkie-talkie] Sydney, are you there?</i>
Yes, Jarod.
You'll see a road a quarter of a mile up.
Turn right.
My father will know
where to go from there.
<i>[Sydney On Walkie-talkie]</i>
<i>All right, Jarod. I'll follow his instructions.</i>
Well, he- he didn't say where.
Only that his father knew.
Great. We're in the middle
of nowhere with no Sydney...
and no idea
where he's going.
- I know exactly where he's going.
- Yeah?
Well, where might that be?
To the beginning
of this little odyssey.
[Sighs]
Well, I gotta
hand it to you.
<i>Capturing the king
is inspired.
Walking into the Centre
to cut your deal.
- Real bold.
- Not bold.
Prudent. Necessity.
Exhibition of resolve.
You people only understand
one thing: Power.
Whatever it was,
it was brilliant.
No wonder my people have
such a hard time catching up to you.
Of course, that's why we want you back.
'Cause you're brilliant.
I'm not going back.
Neither is he.
I do have one question.
It's your nickel.
Why? Why do you do it?
Why the Centre?
Give and take.
For a cause bigger than
both of us.
<i>Oh, hell. I don't expect</i>
<i>you to understand it...</i>
but in the end,
it does all add up.
You steal children.
You create them.
How does that add up?
Rape, incest, murder.
Survival.
Given enough incentive,
man is capable of almost anything.
<i>[Car Approaching]</i>
It's time to go.
Dad.
<i>Now take care of your father.</i>
<i>And of yourself.</i>
Thank you, Sydney.
<i>Come on, Dad.
Jarod.
<i>I'm glad you found</i>
<i>your family.</i>
<i>[Car Rapidly Approaching]</i>
- I told you. Sydney comes alone!
- Jarod, I had no choice.
They're planning to kill my father.
- Who?
- <i>[Helicopter Approaching]</i>
Daddy, get back!
- I've got him.
- Shoot him!
[Gunshot]
<i>[Gunshots]</i>
- God, no!
- <i>[Jarod] She's losing a lot ofblood.</i>
Keep this compressed
against the wound.
[Raines]
Forget Parker. Stop the plane!
Jarod, let's go!
- You go ahead without me!
- Jarod.
That boy needs a father.
Now go! We'll catch up later!
I love you, Son!
I love you too, Dad.
Go! Go! Go!
<i>[Jarod's Voice]</i>
<i>I've got to get her to the hospital.</i>
You're not going anywhere.
Looks like you're out of luck.
Now, you want to do this the easy way,
or do you want to end up like her?
Stop him!
Welcome back
to the Centre, Jarod.
Angel, don't leave me.
Don't leave me, angel.
J'ai fini ma construction.
J'ai fini !

C'est à notre zigoto ?
Oui, on n'a touché à rien.
La société y a veillé.
Vous me faites marcher

pouviez créer assez de désordre
pour me faire revenir.
Moi aussi, je suis ravi
de travailler avec vous.
Pas pour longtemps.
On a bloqué son compte
à Anchorage.
S'il retire de l'argent,
on le tient.
Ne le sous-estimez pas.
ll faudra de la patience.
Dans votre laboratoire,
vous pouvez vous contenter
d'explorer des cerveaux
pour résoudre des problèmes.
Mais mon plan de carrière
n'inclut pas de crapahuter
à la poursuite du petit prodige.
Vous étiez une fillette heureuse.
Que vous est-il arrivé ?
J'ai grandi, Sydney.
Vous devriez en faire autant.
C'est une perte de temps !
J'ai fouillé mille fois
la chambre de Jarod.
Pas moi.
Qu'espérez-vous trouver ?
ll a laissé un caillou
sur le pétrolier.
Je parie
qu'il en a laissé un ici.
Envoyez la simu.
C'est le dernier projet de Jarod.
La boîte noire
n'ayant pas été retrouvée,
il a simulé
les derniers instants du crash.
Grâce à ses talents innés
de Caméléon,
Jarod est devenu chaque membre
de l'équipage
et a mis le doigt
sur la cause du crash.
Sacré environnement pour lui !
Dans ces conditions,
on le retrouvera
déguisé en employé des postes.
ll ne se déguise pas.
C'est un Caméléon,
il devient ce qu'il veut.
Le Centre devrait s'en tenir
aux ordinateurs.
- lls ne s'enfuient pas.
- lls ne sont pas humains.
lls ne peuvent pas savoir
ce qu'a éprouvé l'équipage,
en quoi ses émotions
ont façonné son sort.
- Jarod, lui, peut.
- Très très astucieux.
Vous savez ce que c'est ?
Un ange. Je n'ai pas encore
trouvé de lien affectif.
Ce n'est pas ange. Ses ailes
sont pliées. C'est Onisios,
un dieu grec
qui défend les opprimés.
Comment connaissez-vous
autant la mythologie ?
J'ai eu plein
de petits amis étudiants.
Voilà votre caillou.
Votre détraqué se prend
pour un justicier
défendant les faibles.
Collège de St Andrews,
dans le Queens.
Un enfant perd ses parents
Ca va fondre.
Bien sûr.
C'est bon.
Vraiment très bon.
La crème est fouettée ?
Je la fais pas, je la vends.
Fascinant ! On gagne de l'argent
en devinant des mots ?
C'est La Roue de la fortune !
D'où vous sortez ?
J'ai été très occupé.
''La cour de Miles Standish''.
ll y a un petit problème.
D'après le distributeur
de billets,
votre compte en Alaska
a été gelé.
Sans faire de jeu de mots.
Mes efforts méritent
une récompense.
Vous avez fait comme j'ai dit ?
Ca méritait
un prix d'interprétation !
Vous me payez
alors que vous êtes fauché ?
On a passé un accord.
Comme vous voudrez.
Vous me savez où me trouver.
Un instant !
Entrez.
Bonjour, Dr Russell.
Pourriez-vous aller voir
la dame grecque ?
On ne peut pas l'approcher.
Personne ne la comprend.
J'arrive.
Nicole, rendez-moi un service.
Que le labo fasse
des examens complets là-dessus.
Et vite !
Merci.
Vous êtes médecin ?
Aujourd'hui, oui.
Vous parlez anglais ?
Quand j'en ai envie.
Et je refuse d'être opérée !
Ca fait mal ?
Je ne fais plus depuis un mois.
Détendez-vous.
Comment faire,
avec tous ces examens ?
lls veulent m'ouvrir le ventre.
Je vais annuler l'opération.
Pas d'opération ?
Je vais essayer autre chose.
Vous êtes pas médecin.
Vous êtes humain.
Sandy, je vous écoute.
On a réussi notre coup
avec le compte de Jarod.
Tu parles d'un génie !
On va bientôt avoir
l'image satellite.
ll est à Santa Fe.
- Préparez le jet.
- Attendez !
ll est à Rome !
Au Luxembourg...
Ce salaud a brouillé le système.
Salut, tout le monde !
Salut, Jarod.
Vous avez annulé
l'opération de Mme Nikkos ?
En effet.
C'est vous, le médecin.
Tant que ça me retombe pas dessus.
Je vais essayer
une infusion à base de séné.
C'est un hôpital.
On ne fait pas ça ici !
Maintenant, si. ll me faut
la clé du service de radiologie.
Andy est parti déjeuner...
Je sais.
Tenez.
Ca va, mon poussin ?
Tu as apporté à manger
pour maman ?
Devine quoi.
Donnez-moi un coup de main,
si vous en avez une de libre.
Le Dr Russell !
- Qui ça ?
- Je suis nouveau.
Et moi... je suis gêné.
Mais je suis toujours ravi
de rendre service.
Je pensais que le Dr Trader
suivait Kevin Bailey.
- Que faites-vous ?
- Je vous retourne la question !
Je peux tout oublier,
si vous faites pareil.
Très bien.
Le problème se situe au niveau
de la 8e vertèbre qui a sectionné
la moelle épinière.
- ll n'avait aucune chance.
- Je vois.
Mais cette radio date d'avant
l'opération, et celle-ci d'après.
Comment peuvent-elles être
identiques ?
C'est impossible.
Quelqu'un a fait une copie
du cliché postopératoire.
Vous voyez le voile
dans le coin ?
La vieille machine du sous-sol
fait ça.
J'ai renversé de la limonade
dessus à mon arrivée ici.
La nouvelle machine
ne fait pas ça.
Pourquoi photocopier
une radio
et changer l'étiquette ?
On se le demande !
Je gravis les dernières marches,
terrifié
par ce que je vais faire.
J'ai le coeur qui bat,
les mains moites...
J'ai du mal à tenir
mes soi-disant
tringles à rideaux.
Un enfant
peut oublier ses parents ?
Concentre-toi
sur la simulation, Jarod.
En approchant de la fenêtre,
j'entends
les bruits de la foule, en bas.
Je les vois arriver.
A quelle vitesse ?
60 km/h, tu le sais.
J'ai la gorge sèche
et les mains qui tremblent.
J'épaule la carabine.
Je ne peuxpas tirer
assez de coups avant le pont.
Je ne peux faire ça tout seul.
ll n'était pas seul.
ll lui fallait un complice.
Trader n'était pas seul non plus.
Bravo !
Belle partie !
Rassurez-vous,
il gagne toujours.
Jarod est compétitif.
ll est jeune.
Et vous, paresseux.
ll y a de ça !
Calsix... Vous avez
un problème cardiaque ?
Miles
est une bombe à retardement.
Deux infarctus. Encore un
et c'est le pontage.
Voilà pourquoi je joue au squash.
Je suis à sec.
Moi aussi.
C'est mon jour de congé.
Chacun fait de l'exercice
à sa façon !
- Notre hôpital vous séduit ?
- Absolument.
Les fautes professionnelles
ont assez peu de retombées.
Hélas, tout a un prix.
On a eu des difficultés,
mais on vaut tous les hôpitaux.
Le terrain n'est pas miné ?
Même pour Kevin Bailey ?
C'était une tragédie,
mais avouons-le,
un orphelin handicapé,
ça fait sensation.
C'était la chasse aux sorcières.
Une fois l'exaltation retombée,
la vérité a repris le pas.
Tout ça, c'est du passé.
- Vous plaisantez ?
- C'est bon.
Vous ne savez pas
qu'il ne faut pas parler
aux inconnus ?
Je m'appelle Jarod.
C'est meilleur
avant que ça fonde.
Tu as toujours des crampes
dans les mains ?
Comment vous le savez ?
J'ai de l'imagination.
Ca va s'arranger.
Je te le promets.
Vous avez un certain
Shreve Harmon sur la 7.
Shreve et Harmon ont construit
l'Empire State Building !
Passez-le-moi
et localisez l'appel.
Très astucieux, Jarod.
Comment ça va ?
Je suis fauché.
Mon compte est bloqué.
Je t'ai raté de peu
à Cincinnati.
Les fleurs étaient fraîches.
Mes parents sont morts depuis 30 ans.
Ils était tant que je leur dise adieu.
C'est une façon intéressante
de parler !
- Pourquoi es-tu parti ?
- C'est vous, le psy.
Vous voulez la vérité ?
C'est à cause des mensonges.
De vos mensonges.
Quels mensonges ?
J'ai découvert la véritable
application de mes simulations.
Simulation de la flotte
du Pacifique Sud.
Avec mes résultats,
vous avez fait sauter un bateau !
ll y avait 133 personnes à bord.
Ma simulation d'épidémie,
vous l'avez utilisée
sur le terrain.
46 personnes sont mortes
du virus Ebola.
Simulation 27, simulation 16,
simulation 42...
ll s'agissait
de contrats militaires.
J'ignorais leurs applications
finales !
Combien de gens
sont morts à cause de moi ?
Rentre à la maison.
Je m'inquiète pour toi.
J'arpente ta chambre
et elle paraît... vide.
Elle ne me manque pas.
Au fait,
c'est bon, la glace.
Ca devient sérieux.
Mlle Parker est sur le coup.
Restez sur vos gardes, Sydney.
- Que fais-tu ?
- Je mets à profit
ce que vous m'avez appris.
Je suis complètement bloqué !
On est bloqués.
Notre client voulait savoir
si on peut manipuler la bourse.
Jarod a passé 4 mois
sur la simulation.
Où est le problème ?
On a 5 millions pour tester
les données de Jarod.
Jarod connaissait
la date du test.
Quelqu'un
a manipulé le marché et volé
nos 5 millions.
Qui ça peut bien être ?
Au moins, on sait où il est.
Voilà une drôle de médecine !
Je risque de mourir de rire
avant de faire caca !
Le rire
est une excellente thérapie,
tout comme la réflexologie.
Nicole, vous pouvez masser
ces points ?
Vous allez me dire la vérité ?
Quelle vérité ?
Un homme qui m'offre le soleil,
me masse les pieds,
me prépare
une affreuse infusion...
Qui êtes-vous ?
Tant de tristesse...
et tant de joie.
C'est bon de savoir
qu'il n'y a que 137 hôpitaux
dans l'agglomération de New York.
Vos chambres ont été payées.
Pardon ?
En espèces.
Et le monsieur a laissé ça.
Pas un mot.
Une autre limonade, Denise.
La même chose.
On vous a agressé
ou la journée a été dure ?
Quatre blessures par balle,
une lobectomie et c'est pas fini.
Je crois que j'ai fait
une grosse connerie.
Comment ça va ?
La boîte vocale de Trader ?
J'ai un message pour lui.
Quel est le problème ?
La lobectomie.
J'ai laissé des pinces
et j'ai recousu.
C'est rien.
- Ca risque de se savoir !
- Regardez le diagramme.
Vous localiserez vos pinces.
Et après ?
Retirez-les.
Prétextez une hémorragie interne.
C'est vous, le médecin.
Ca tombe toujours
pendant le déjeuner !
Où est le cliché préopératoire
de Bailey ?
Je dois y aller.
Merci du conseil, Alan.
Vous êtes là, tant mieux !
Le bilan sanguin
que vous vouliez.
Au bout de 36 h
il semble déjà
plus doué que les autres.
J'ai fini !
Je m'appelle Sydney.
Je vais m'occuper de toi.
Pourquoi ?
Où sont mes parents ?
Avancez. Restez calmes.
Sydney, on se retrouve en bas !
Un instant !
Désolé de vous réveiller,
mais il fallait que je vous voie.
Tu as l'air en forme.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Des instructions
pour récupérer vos 5 millions.
Moins ma commission.
Ne prenez pas l'air surpris.
Je ne veux pas d'argent,
mais la vérité.
Qu'est-ce que tu dis ?
Qui suis-je ?
Le Centre m'a adopté ?
J'ai été acheté ou volé ?
Et où sont mes parents ?
Tu sais que tes parents sont
morts dans un accident d'avion.
Oui, je connais la chanson.
On me l'a serinée
pendant 30 ans.
Mais j'ai vérifié.
J'ai une anomalie génétique
dans le sang.
Mes soi-disant parents devraient
l'avoir aussi, mais ne l'ont pas.
ll est donc impossible
que je sois leur fils.
Alors, la vérité, pour une fois !
Et zut !
Pas de fumée.
Poussez-vous !
Je suis désolé, Jarod.
Je ne savais pas.
ll faut que tu me croies.
- Mais ça n'est pas important.
- Pour moi, si.
ll n'est plus question
que je sois votre cobaye.
Vous m'avez appris
à être qui je voulais.
Je peux être médecin,
ingénieur, astronaute !
Et bien plus !
Mais je ne sais pas qui je suis !
- Dites-le-moi.
- Je l'ignore aussi.
A l'époque, je n'avais aucune
raison de me méfier du Centre.
- Juré.
- Prouvez-le.
Donnez-moi le code d'accès
au Centre de demain.
La vérité sur moi
doit se trouver là-bas.
Je ne peux pas.
Vous m'avez volé ma vie !
Rendez-la-moi.
Tirez !
Pas d'armes !
Décidez-vous, Sydney.
Soyez un scientifique
ou une maman.
Les deux, c'est impossible.
Excusez-moi.
Je peux vous parler ?
Quelque chose ne va pas ?
Vous n'êtes pas censé avoir ça.
Je savais
que Trader était dans le coup,
mais j'ignorais
pourquoi quelqu'un le couvrait.
- Je ne comprends pas.
- J'étais dans ce cas
avant de découvrir ça.
Une copie de votre casier.
A part Trader, qui sait que
vous avez fait de la prison ?
Vous êtes qui ?
Quelqu'un qui trouve
le cas Bailey injuste.
Vous croyez que j'en doute ?
Ca a été très dur
de me ressaisir.
J'ai un travail,
j'ai un bon mari
et un superbe petit garçon.
Je ne veux pas les perdre.
Je ne veux pas que ça arrive.
Dites seulement la vérité.
Que feriez-vous si votre femme
vous disait qu'elle avait pris
du crack et fait de la prison ?
Je dirais qu'elle a payé sa dette
et qu'elle aurait dû me faire
confiance et tout me dire.
Je pense
que c'est ce que je ferais.
Si vous saviez
comme j'ai peur...
Je crois le savoir.
Ce soir-là, j'ai dû appeler
le Dr Trader au Silver Rail.
On savait tous qu'il buvait,
mais personne ne l'avouait.
Je lui ai montré les radios.
Je savais qu'il fallait
stabiliser le petit.
Mais il a insisté,
j'avais tort et...
C'était lui, le médecin.
ll a sectionné la moelle épinière
du petit en le bougeant.
Mais c'est le Dr Hendricks
qui a menacé de révéler mon passé
si je m'en mêlais.
Quand Trader s'est rendu compte
de ce qu'il avait fait,
il m'a dit de brûler
le cliché préopératoire.
Mais je n'ai pas pu.
Je suis allée voir le Dr Hendricks.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi,
vu qu'il couvre Trader
depuis des années.
ll a pris les radios
et m'a fait jurer de ne dire
à personne qu'il les avait.
Selon lui, ça servirait
pour l'assurance.
Merci.
Le Dr Hendricks
ne vous donnera pas le cliché.
ll tient trop
au rachat de l'hôpital.
Alan, c'est Jarod.
ll faut qu'on parle.
- De quoi ?
- Pas au téléphone.
On peut se retrouver
au Silver Rail ? A midi ?
- J'y serai.
- Merci, Alan.
Miles ? C'est Jarod Russell.
Que puis-je pour vous ?
Si on rejouait au squash ?
Pourquoi ? Je vous ai écrasé !
Pour vous renvoyer l'ascenseur.
Pourquoi pas aujourd'hui
à midi ?
Tant pis pour vous...
Parfois, on n'a pas le choix !
Point, jeu et match !
Passez-moi ma bouteille d'eau !
Pourquoi vous torturer, Jarod ?
Je pensais
qu'en vous laissant gagner,
vous auriez pitié
et me donneriez plus d'actions.
Ma pitié n'est pas bradée.
Sachez une chose :
vous m'avez épuisé,
vous progressez.
Je m'entraîne.
Mais j'ai gagné !
Ca va ?
Appelez une ambulance !
Le Dr Russell a un peu de retard.
Comme tous les médecins !
Je vais en reprendre un autre.
Au boulot !
Le Dr Hendricks fait un infarctus.
Pouls à 112, tension en baisse.
Mettez-le sous perfusion
et préparez-le
pour une intervention !
Vous m'avez menti.
Vous m'avez dit
que Jarod était venu
rapporter les 5 millions.
- ll voulait le code d'accès.
- C'est la moindre des choses.
On lui a menti pour ses parents.
A moi aussi.
Ne boudez pas.
C'était top secret,
vous n'aviez pas à savoir.
Vous nous avez rendu service.
Son dossier
est sous surveillance.
ll s'est connecté.
- Où est-il ?
- Au Queen of Angels.
La voiture arrive, allons-y.
Le Centre le veut vivant.
De préférence.
On n'a pas trouvé
de cardiologue,
mais rassurez-vous,
j'ai appelé le Dr Trader.
ll s'occupera de vous,
comme de Kevin Bailey.
Non, je vous en prie.
Opérez-moi.
Pas de problème.
Mais d'abord, dites-moi
où est la radio de Kevin Bailey.
Le cliché
est dans mon bureau.
Opérez-moi, Jarod.
J'aimerais bien, Miles.
Mais ce serait contre l'éthique.
Voyez-vous...
je ne suis pas vraiment médecin.
Et vous n'avez pas vraiment
d'infarctus.
Trader, il est à vous.
Allons-y.
On commencera
par le premier étage.
Pas question
que Jarod nous échappe !
Appelez le service de sécurité
pour empêcher Trader d'opérer.
ll est soûl.
Mon Dieu !
Devinez
ce que j'ai fait !
Formidable !
ll est forcément
dans une chambre.
Allons-y !
ll a pris l'issue de secours !
ll se dirige vers le toit !
Embarquez
ou vous allez rater l'avion.
Ne vous inquiétez pas.
lls ne partiront pas sans moi.
Vous l'avez raté.
ll est parti
il y a quelques jours.
Je vais voir dans la commode.
ll était comment ?
Environ 1,85 m et 75 kg...
Ce n'est pas
ce que je veux dire.
ll avait l'air
en bonne santé ?
Vous plaisantez ?
C'est un véritable athlčte !
Si M. Spitz n'était pas vraiment
ingénieur atomique,
comment il a empęché la centrale
de nous faire griller ?
- M. Spitz est...
- Un homme fascinant.
Encore un coup de poignard dans
la tragédie oedipienne de Jarod ?
Jarod ! C'était
son prénom...
C'est bizarre.
Qui croirait
qu'un adulte comme M. Spitz
ne sait pas nager ?
ll prenait
des leçons de natation ?
Ca fait partie de notre boulot.
ll apprenait vite.
ll a franchi tous les niveaux
en un mois.
Tous les jours,
il ne faisait que nager.
Sauf la derničre semaine.
ll était dans la piscine,
mais ne nageait pas.
Comment ça ?
De l'ouverture ŕ la fermeture,
il était lŕ oů on a pas pied
et faisait du surplace,
sans arręt.
ll faisait du surplace.
Que manigance encore
votre cobaye ?
On vire et on descend !
Plus prčs !
ll y a pas mal de fumée.
J'appelle du renfort.
Elle saute par-dessus bord !
On n'a pas le temps !
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Ne vous en faites pas.
Mlle Parker, un fax pour vous.
Désolé de vous avoir ratés.
Les apparences sont trompeuses.
1 324.
Trčs bien, les filles,
et tout ŕ fait exact.
Sydney, tout de suite !
Votre comédie
perturbe les enfants.
Epargnez-moi ce couplet !
Broots nous aidera
ŕ localiser Jarod.
Je trouve ça plus important
que Numéro 1 et Numéro 2.
Broots ne peut pas nous aider
ŕ localiser un Caméléon.
Jarod change de couleur,
se fond dans le paysage.
On doit attendre.
ll faut de la patience, Parker.
Ce mot est peut-ętre rassurant
et passe-partout pour les psys,
mais pour mon pčre et sa bande,
patience égale échec.
Jarod est un Caméléon.
ll peut devenir qui il veut.
Les écoutes téléphoniques
de Broots sont inutiles.
Vous aviez dit ça
pour le bombardier.
Comment on a attrapé
le détraqué ?
Une lettre ŕ sa maman.
Les petits génies
font toujours des bętises.
Prenons l'escalier.
ll n'y a que trois étages.
Ne m'infantilisez pas.
Ca fait 20 ans.
Je peux prendre cet ascenseur.
Vous devez aussi pouvoir.
Votre mčre était exceptionnelle.
Ma mčre était faible.
Point final.
Elle ne pouvait pas
assumer les pressions.
Je n'ai pas ce problčme.
La seule chose
qui me travaille, c'est :
pourquoi dans un ascenseur ?
lls montent, ils descendent,
mais n'arrivent nulle part.
C'est fou, comme une balle
peut changer la vie.
Si vous voulez en parler...
La séance que ma mčre
a eue avec vous
n'est-elle pas la derničre chose
qu'elle ait faite ?
Non, merci.
J'assume les risques.
Bonjour.
Vous avez l'air bien reposé
pour un garde-côte !
Je ne vis pas ŕ la base.
ll m'a fallu trois ans et un mari
pour y arriver. Et vous ?
J'ai falsifié des documents.
Martha ? Ca va ?
Un mauvais sushi.
lls le sont tous !
Lt Campbell ? Bonjour !
Ravi de vous voir.
Voici le capitaine Paul Bilson.
Enchanté.
Vous avez fait
du bon boulot hier.
Vous avez sauvé la victime.
Heureusement
que j'ai appris ŕ nager !
Si toute l'équipe
avait votre modestie,
sans parler du talent...
Je voulais
parler de ma révision de grade.
Voyez le capitaine.
Je suis au courant.
Je m'en occupe.
Je vous laisse
entre de bonnes mains.
Avez-vous le pied marin ?
Voler, c'est facile, non ?
Pour un cerf-volant, peut-ętre.
Bonjour.
Le Christi ronronne comme un chat.
Je m'en méfie.
Je prends le 45.
Vous ętes d'attaque
pour partir en mer ?
Toujours pręt !
Javi, on attend !
J'appelle la base.
lnternet, vous connaissez ?
Je suis un puriste.
Vous venez ?
- Jarod Campbell.
- Javi Padilla.
Enchanté.
Bilson est toujours pressé ?
Quand l'océan appelle, oui.
Alors, vous avez conduit
un brise-glace ŕ Katima Bay ?
Les Grands Lacs ?
C'est un marin d'eau douce !
Je vous en prie !
En tout cas, j'ai été
transféré dans une bonne unité.
Exact. Rien que l'an dernier,
on a effectué 178 sauvetages.
Ca m'a l'air d'un 42-80.
ll gîte de 3l. Abandonné ?
Je crois.
Javi, appelez-le !
Allez voir, Jarod.
C'est le garde-côte !
ll y a quelqu'un ?
Personne ne vous veut de mal.
Bon sang !
Roy Abbott,
voici le lieutenant Campbell.
Jarod.
Allez-vous-en !
On ne traite pas un nouveau
comme ça !
Vous manquez de provisions
et vous prenez l'eau.
On peut vous remorquer jusqu'ŕ
la côte pour vous ravitailler.
J'ai besoin de rien.
Je suis trčs bien ici.
Le capitaine n'est pas d'accord.
On vous laisse une semaine,
sinon on vous ramčne.
C'est pour votre bien,
M. Abbott.
Vous devriez faire des rondes
dans le couloir 15 !
Męme les psychiatres
se reposent parfois.
Votre intéręt pour moi
n'est donc pas paternel ?
Apprendre ŕ nager, c'est bien,
mais tu es trop vieux
pour jouer dans ta baignoire !
C'est mieux que les jeux
que vous m'avez imposés.
C'est drôle,
je ne vois pas leur visage.
Mais leurs yeux...
me regardent fixement.
Les yeux de qui ?
Je ne sais pas. Des yeux morts.
Les yeux de ceux qui sont morts
ŕ cause de mes simulations.
Et maintenant,
tu veux réparer tout ça
en utilisant ton don
pour devenir un ange vengeur ?
Si on veut.
Pourquoi appeler ?
Je voulais savoir
si Jarod était mon vrai nom.
Je crois.
Du moins, c'est ce qu'on m'a dit.
Ne raccroche pas.
Je suis inquiet ŕ ton sujet.
Dans ce cas,
alertez les autorités !
Tu sais que c'est impossible.
Pourquoi ?
Par amour pour moi
ou par peur de ce que je sais ?
Si jamais on découvre
ce que tu as,
je ne pourrai pas te protéger.
Si on découvre ce que j'ai,
c'est vous
que vous ne pourrez pas protéger.
Ces disques
contiennent mon travail.
lls contiennent ma vie.
On tient votre petit génie !
C'est trčs intéressant.
ll existe quelqu'un
qui fabrique des imitations
de matičres fécales canines ?
Ca rentre pas sur l'étiquette.
On met 'fausse crotte de chien''.
Et pourquoi quelqu'un achčterait
une fausse crotte de chien ?
Parce que c'est marrant.
Je voudrais les blanches.
C'est marrant.
J'ai pris les blanches, maman.
C'étaient ses préférées.
Un homme disparaît en mer
La noyade est jugée accidentelle
Son épouse conteste
les recherches des garde-côtes
L'appel provenait
de cette auberge de jeunesse.
Attrapez-le !
J'ai rien fait !
Que faites-vous
dans cette chambre ?
Ce type m'a donné sa chambre.
- C'est lui ?
- C'est bien lui.
ll est chef d'orchestre.
ll paie le loyer
si je transfčre ses appels.
ll a dit qu'il adorait voyager.
Taisez-vous, Sydney.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je passais par lŕ.
Permission de monter ŕ bord ?
Accordée.
Magdeline est jolie.
Comment vous la connaissez ?
Je parlais de votre bateau.
C'est votre femme ?
Ca aurait pu.
Elle aurait sűrement voulu.
Je le lui ai jamais demandé.
Vous croyez que le Hollandais
a trouvé son amour perdu ?
Comment ?
L'opéra que vous écoutiez.
Le Hollandais de wagner.
C'est ça, l'histoire.
Je me demande
s'il trouve son amour
ou flotte ŕ jamais
autour du vaisseau fantôme.
J'y ai jamais trop pensé.
C'est dur d'ignorer
si un ętre cher vit encore...
Je déplacerai pas mon bateau.
Je ne vous le demande pas.
Cet uniforme
vous force pas ŕ le faire ?
J'ai seulement emprunté
cet uniforme.
Je vous ai apporté
des provisions.
Je vous les échange...
contre ce coffret.
La prochaine fois,
ajoutez des bougies.
Marché conclu.
Parfait.
ll vous arrive d'écouter Mozart ?
La Flűte enchantée ?
Celui-lŕ me plaît, Ca me suffit.
Une fois, j'ai pu l'écouter
quand j'étais enfant.
Je fermais les yeux
et dans mon imagination,
je devenais un aigle.
Je pouvais aller n'importe oů,
faire n'importe quoi.
Rien ne pouvait m'arręter.
Mozart en savait peut-ętre
plus que wagner.
Je déplacerai pas mon bateau.
Lieutenant,
męme en patrouille de routine,
je compte sur vous.
Ca n'est pas une bibliothčque.
J'essaie de m'y retrouver
dans certaines recherches.
Je vous invite ŕ déjeuner
si je peux faire appel
ŕ vos lumičres.
Tant que ça n'est pas du sushi.
Je ne jouerai pas les marins
d'eau douce ŕ ma révision de grade.
Attendez un peu.
Vous venez d'arriver
et on révise votre grade ?
Génial !
Tout ce qu'il me manquait,
c'est un rival de plus !
C'est pour quand ?
J'aurais déjŕ dű
passer capitaine.
Mais Powell repousse sans cesse.
Pas votre promotion, votre bébé.
D'aprčs vos nausées
et votre mal de dos, vous devez
en ętre ŕ 9 semaines.
Mon mari n'est męme pas
au courant.
Vous ętes aussi obstétricien ?
Non, mais j'ai été sage-femme.
Powell n'est pas au courant ?
Sűrement pas !
Si quelqu'un l'apprend,
adieu ma promotion !
Votre secret sera bien gardé.
- Que s'est-il passé, Broots ?
- J'essaie de localiser l'appel.
Mais il s'avčre que ce sont
des lignes internationales.
Combien de temps
pour le localiser ?
C'est dur ŕ dire. La méthode
de Jarod est tellement simple...
20... 24 heures.
Je vous en donne 12.
Je peux le faire en 8 heures.
Le dossier King ?
Une affaire délicate.
Ca a compliqué les choses.
Voyez Bilson, c'était son bébé.
C'est arrivé
pendant sa patrouille de nuit.
Bilson était de service.
Ca n'a pas été évident.
On n'a jamais retrouvé
le bateau de King.
C'est une affaire
particuličrement triste.
King aurait fait un jour et demi
de surplace avant de se noyer.
La patrouille
est rentrée bredouille,
la nouvelle a été trčs rude.
Selon ce rapport, les recherches
ont été basées sur les données
de courant des balises.
C'est moi qui m'en suis chargée.
Pilcher's Point.
C'est lŕ que Tom King pęchait.
Bilson a lancé les recherches
au sud-est de ce point ?
C'est la procédure standard.
Quel est le problčme ?
Selon les données par satellite,
les bouées indiquaient un courant
vers le sud-ouest.
Vous vous y prenez mal.
Enfant,
vous ne mangiez pas de biscuits ?
ll n'y en avait pas
lŕ oů j'ai grandi.
Vous avez grandi sur Mars ?
Presque.
D'abord,
on tord le biscuit
pour que le haut se défasse...
comme un petit couvercle.
Tout le blanc se défait.
Je le prends avec les dents,
mais on peut aussi le lécher.
Que fait-on du marron ?
Les grands le mangent.
Autant vendre juste le blanc !
Ca serait pas marrant.
Ta mčre travaille dur.
Depuis la mort de mon pčre,
elle ne fait plus que ça.
ll est avec St Andrew,
le patron de pęcheurs.
J'ai trouvé une statue
pour mon pčre ŕ l'église.
ll en avait une sur son bateau,
mais on l'a jamais retrouvé.
C'est dur de perdre
un de ses parents.
Je sais de quoi je parle.
Qu'est-ce qui te manque le plus ?
Le sourire de maman.
- Je n'y arrive pas !
- ll le faut.
ll reste combien d'oxygčne ?
Moins de 48 h.
La cause de l'explosion ?
On l'ignore.
Le carburant.
L'oxygčne.
Rien ne peut nous sauver !
Tu dois sauver l'équipage !
Non, c'est impossible !
Si tu renonces, vous mourez !
Allez, Jarod !
Attendez, j'ai trouvé !
Je peux utiliser
la gravitation de la lune.
Trčs bien, Jarod.
Je savais que tu pouvais,
si tu voulais.
lls ne voulaient pas
sauver Tom King.
lls voulaient qu'il meure...
Quoi ?
Je te réveille en pleine nuit
et je n'obtiens
qu'un ''quoi''mou ?
Si tu veux de l'esprit,
lis Noel Coward.
ll est quelle heure chez toi ?
C'est mignon.
Pas drôle, mais mignon.
Tu appelles ŕ la maison,
maintenant.
J'en suis flattée.
Je culpabilise
ŕ cause de mon jeu téléphonique.
Je devrais enregistrer ça
et le repasser ŕ Noël.
Tu seras lŕ, rassure-toi.
J'ai bien besoin d'ętre rassuré.
Tu me brises le coeur.
Pourquoi
l'auberge de jeunesse YMCA ?
Je regardais une soirée rétro
ŕ la télé sur les années 70.
Comme tu le sais,
je les ai ratées.
ll y avait un groupe qui chantait
les louanges du YMCA.
Et voilŕ...
C'est mignon.
Pas drôle, mais mignon.
Tu savais qu'on fabriquait
de fausses crottes de chien ?
C'est fou.
Ca semble ętre une chose
et en fait,
c'est complčtement autre chose.
En quoi ça me concerne ?
Ca pourrait ętre
une mine d'or pour le Centre.
N'est-ce pas la métaphore parfaite
de la façon
dont le Centre
déforme la vérité ?
Et de quelle vérité s'agit-il ?
C'est dans le mot
que je t'ai écrit.
La vérité
sur ce qui te rend triste.
A Katima Bay, on doit pas ętre
ŕ la plage en cette saison !
lls doivent se geler les fesses
sur une mission futile !
A part l'évidence,
pourquoi avoir mis les bouts ?
Je me sentais enfermé
lŕ oů je vivais.
J'ai décidé d'aller ŕ l'ouest.
J'ai d'abord pensé
aux îles anglo-normandes,
mais j'ai opté pour cet endroit.
Bien vu. Les îles anglo-normandes,
c'est pour le rebut.
C'est marrant. Lŕ-bas,
on traite votre unité
de bande de renégats.
N'importe quoi !
On vous dit incapables de sauver
un pęcheur dans la baie
et indignes de porter l'uniforme.
lls parlaient
du sauvetage de King ?
Je crois
qu'ils ont employé ce nom.
ll y a eu un problčme ?
On joue notre vie pour des gens
qui nous démolissent
pour une affaire qui fait la une.
La femme du type
nous en a voulu.
Je comprends sa douleur.
ll lui fallait des coupables
pour affronter ça.
Je vous assure
qu'on a tout fait
pour sauver cet homme.
On a fait notre boulot.
C'est lŕ que Tom King pęchait.
Le courant allait au sud-ouest.
On ne sait pas comment
son bateau a coulé.
On ne l'a jamais retrouvé.
Quoi ?
J'arrive.
Ca n'a pas été facile,
mais j'avoue
que travailler sur Jarod
est un plaisir.
C'est un phénomčne.
Montrez-moi ce que vous avez.
On est partis de l'appel censé
provenir de l'auberge de jeunesse,
chambre 334.
Jarod a connecté entre eux
173 appels internationaux.
Les localiser était impossible
parce qu'au lieu
d'ętre déclenchés
par un seul appel,
les 173 appels
ont été effectués
individuellement.
lngénieux !
J'ai fait un sacré boulot
pour Jarod, et plutôt cher.
Peu importe le prix.
Tant mieux, parce que Jarod
a tout débité sur votre carte.
Oů est-il ?
Dans le dernier endroit
oů on penserait ŕ le chercher.
- Chambre 335...
- La męme auberge de jeunesse ?
Oui, dans la chambre d'ŕ côté.
Je vous ai eu !
J'ai trouvé ça
dans une boutique.
Trčs drôle.
On croit que c'est son jour
de chance et on se trompe !
Que faites-vous ici ?
Comme vous,
je cherche la paix de l'esprit.
Et la raison pour laquelle
elle ne reverra jamais son pčre.
Vous ętes qui ?
Je ne sais pas vraiment.
Mais hier soir,
je suis devenu vous.
J'ai compris pourquoi
vous veniez souvent ici,
pourquoi vous culpabilisez
et pourquoi vous n'avez pas
sauvé son pčre.
On l'a cherché pendant 2 jours.
Mais dans une zone oů vous étiez
sűrs de ne pas le trouver.
Le laisser vivre
était trop risqué !
Quoi ?
Chaque mardi,
vous patrouillez avec Bilson
et chaque mercredi,
vous faites un gros versement
sur votre compte personnel.
De quel genre de contrebande
s'agit-il ?
Vous ętes fou !
Vraiment ?
La peinture de la coque
est la męme que celle
du bateau oů vous étiez
avec Bilson, ce soir-lŕ.
Vous pouvez chercher
le salut partout,
vous ne le trouverez que
dans la vérité que vous fuyez.
On retrouve
un transporteur mexicain
sur le Santa Marca
tous les mardis.
ll apporte une cargaison.
C'est peut-ętre des diams.
On se charge de la livraison.
Je ne sais pas comment
on a heurté son bateau.
ll y avait du brouillard.
Je ne l'ai pas vu.
On l'a coupé en deux.
J'ai fait demi-tour
et je l'ai vu dans l'eau.
ll était toujours vivant.
ll a levé les yeux vers moi
et je me suis dit :
''Le monde est petit...''
Je le voyais souvent ŕ la messe
avec sa fille et sa femme.
Je crois qu'il m'a reconnu.
ll m'a tendu la main
et j'ai essayé
de le faire monter ŕ bord.
Mais Bilson m'en a empęché.
ll a braqué une arme sur moi
en disant...
- Que si vous le sauviez...
- On irait en prison.
J'irai volontiers en prison,
si je sors de cet enfer !
RESERVE AUX BATEAUX
DES GARDE-COTES
J'ai besoin d'un service.
Ca, c'est drôle.
Désolé d'ętre en retard.
- Pour quoi ?
- Pour la patrouille.
On m'a prévenu ce matin.
- Je dois partir avec Javi !
- ll est malade.
Je ne me sens pas bien non plus.
Un mauvais sushi.
Je vous rejoins plus tard.
Bien sűr.
- ll y a un problčme ?
- Non, tout va bien.
A tout de suite.
- Oů est le 45 ?
- En patrouille.
- Le Christi...
- Ronronne, je sais.
Santa Marca ŕ Robin 247.
Répondez, 247.
Vous ne deviez pas
nous contacter avant ce soir.
On a bien reçu votre message
pour le rendez-vous de ce matin.
Vous y serez ? Javi ?
Aujourd'hui ? J'y serai.
Vous voilŕ !
Quand vous voudrez.
C'est une patrouille de routine.
- Je la fais seul.
- C'est sűr ?
Allez vous soigner.
Merci.
Vous pouviez pas dire
qu'il vivait ŕ côté ?
Fallait demander.
De la peinture.
Vous avez vu cet homme ?
C'est le bouquet !
Tu parles que ça ronronne !
Robin 247 ŕ Santa Marca.
Répondez.
45, répondez. Javi ?
Vous arrivez droit sur moi.
Virez de bord !
Vous vous dirigez droit sur moi !
Virez de bord !
Mon Dieu !
Vous ętes fou ou quoi ?
Vous ętes aveugle ?
Lancez-moi une corde !
Je ne peux pas.
Comment ?
Je ne peux pas vous sauver.
Vous passerez en cour martiale.
C'est sérieux,
mais la cour martiale
ne m'affectera pas vraiment.
Je ne suis pas vraiment
lieutenant.
Je ne suis pas vraiment
garde-côte.
Tirez-moi de lŕ !
Ne vous en faites pas, ça ira.
On peut faire du surplace
dans l'eau pendant des jours.
C'est pas drôle.
Vous avez raison,
c'est terrifiant.
On est tout seul,
on ne voit que de l'eau
et on pense
ŕ ce qu'il y au-dessous,
ŕ ce qu'on peut heurter
sous la surface.
Mais au bout d'un moment,
les nerfs se calment.
Malheureusement, c'est lŕ que
le corps commence ŕ faire mal.
La seule façon
de faire cesser la douleur,
c'est d'arręter
de faire du surplace.
Mais alors, on commence ŕ couler.
En cet instant
entre la vie et la mort,
on pense aux gens et aux choses
qu'on laisse derričre,
on lutte
pour remonter ŕ la surface.
On lutte pour survivre.
- Vous pouvez pas me laisser !
- Bien sűr que si.
Tout comme
vous avez laissé Tom King.
J'ai quelque chose
ŕ vous montrer.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
La vérité.
lci l'unité de sauvetage 45,
il y a quelque chose ŕ ramasser
prčs de la balise 29.
Mais prenez votre temps.
Ce n'est qu'un petit débris
qui flotte.
Le voilŕ.
Passez-moi ça !
Cette fois,
tu n'as pas d'issue !
Sydney m'a appris que mon esprit
pouvait m'emmener n'importe oů !
ll est en panne de carburant.
Je vous l'ai dit,
les petits génies
font toujours des bętises.
Allez-y !
ll n'est pas lŕ.
Comment ça ?
Je ne sais pas,
mais il vous a laissé ça.
Salut, Roy !
Belle journée pour nager !
La noyade était un meurtre
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Je ne sais pas.
lls lui font mal !
- Reste lŕ.
- Sortez-la de l'ascenseur !
- Emmenez-le !
- Arrętez !
Eloignez-la !
Maman !
C'est moi.
Je veux savoir
ce qui est arrivé ŕ ma mčre.
- Merci, Roy.
- Pas de quoi.
Magdeline est quelque part.
Qu'allez-vous faire ?
Je vais faire un tour ŕ pied.
Merci.
Et vous ?
Je vais faire un tour de voiture.
Messieurs, attention au départ !
Qu'est-ce qu'il disait ?
Un vortex de chaleur naturelle.
ll appelait ça comme ça.
ll avait raison.
Regardez là-bas.
L'air frais de l'océan
se mêle à l'air brûlant
du désert
et ça donne
une grosse collision de vents.
Et ça fait tourner
les éoliennes.
Vous avez trouvé ça tout seul ?
Pas moi. Jarod.
En les regardant.
Sans bouger un muscle,
ils peuvent entrer
dans le vortex.
ll passait ses journées ici ?
A manger des bonbons
et observer les faucons.
Je m'étonne que votre Dr Dolittle
n'ait pas tenté de leur parler.
ll ne s'intéressait pas
qu'aux oiseaux.
ll craquait vraiment là-dessus.
ll lançait de la poussière
toute la journée.
ll disait qu'il calculait
les courants d'air,
les vents et tout ça.
Pas mal, non ?
Charmant.
Qu'est-ce que tu manigances ?
C'était super !
Bravo, vous avez battu le record.
C'est génial !
L'entretien est terminé.
Si vous voulez ce poste,
- il est à vous.
- Je passerais ma vie en l'air !
Pour un ancien pilote de chasse,
vous vous en sortez bien.
Yeager vend des batteries
et moi, j'ai Skyvionics.
ll faut bien gagner sa vie !
La fin de la guerre froide
a tué la plupart des fournisseurs
et vos actions ont augmenté
de 17% !
- 18.
- Je devrais en acheter un peu.
Avec le système Scimitar
bientôt homologué,
vous devriez en acheter beaucoup.
C'était un Dracon ?
L'Oncle Sam n'est pas seul
à faire des économies.
On teste le Scimitar
sur des avions de la RAF.
Même les Français
ont envoyé un Mirage.
- Vous avez vu Dixon ?
- Le voilà !
C'est un bon pilote,
mais pas très ponctuel.
ll ratera son enterrement.
Tu es en retard.
Mais quelle entrée !
Comment il s'en est tiré ?
En une semaine, il a effectué
autant de tests qu'en 3 semaines.
- Un record !
- Tu plaisantes ?
- ll a obtenu 34%.
- C'était facile.
Sauf que Dixon
n'a fait que 33%.
Chaperonnez ce champion.
ll vous expliquera
le nouveau système.
Vous le stimulerez.
A la fin de la semaine, je verrai
qui passera le test du Pentagone.
Aucune pression.
ll paraît que tu as piloté
pour la ClA ?
Qui était ton contact ?
Andrew Sterling.
Un véritable agent secret !
J'ai fait des missions pour lui
à Singapour dans les années 80.
Corée du Nord.
J'arrive pas à croire
que je travaille pour Matthews !
Un seul pilote le surpasse.
Qui est-ce ?
ll est devant toi.
Comment il était, là-haut ?
J'ai hâte de m'envoler
à nouveau avec lui.
Le corps, c'est F-16
et le cerveau, votre serviteur.
Avec Scimitar,
un ordinateur de bord
travaille dix fois plus vite.
Dans ce métier,
la vitesse, c'est la vie.
Tom a enfin trouvé des as
- pour relever le niveau.
- Problèmes de qualité ?
- M. Lawson !
- Tout dépend à qui on demande.
Je voudrais
le dossier sur l'hydraulique.
Votre disque est rayé.
Réparez-le vite.
A vos ordres.
Les stéréogrammes. Je n'ai jamais
réussi à discerner une image.
Un pingouin et un sphinx.
Un pingouin sur un chameau.
Un pingouin sur une péniche
descendant le Nil. Plutôt rare !
Je pourrais regarder ça
une semaine... Rien.
Question de muscles oculaires.
On se concentre sur l'affiche
et on se déplace de 8° à gauche.
- C'est une de vos inventions ?
- Officiellement, non.
- Jarod wright.
- Le remplaçant de Collins.
- Lieutenant Janice Gant.
- Enchanté.
Un pingouin ?
Tu as rencontré
Miss Sympathie !
C'est l'officier le plus coriace.
Elle s'occupe
des missions spéciales !
Elle nous a à l'oeil.
Ca me rappelle Clearview Ridge.
Un vortex de chaleur naturelle.
Tu te prends un de ces vents !
Accélère dans ce secteur,
l'avion est fichu !
Clearview Ridge ?
Merci du tuyau.
Un crash
dû à une erreur du pilote ?
Ne me dis pas ce que tu vois.
Dis-moi ce que tu éprouves.
Je suis fatigué,
j'ai mal aux jambes.
Dépasse la douleur. Concentre-toi.
ll nous faut des détails.
Ce casque est trop serré.
ll fait chaud.
Je n'aime pas ça.
Pourquoi je n'ai pas un vélo
qui va quelque part ?
Sydney !
Un instant.
Bonjour, M. Hollis. Ca va ?
Très bien, à merveille.
- Je peux vous aider ?
- Pourquoi une 2e ligne ?
Pour mon modem.
Je charge quelque chose.
Vous êtes un des leurs !
Les moutons, ceux qui acceptent
d'abandonner leur intimité.
Pardon ?
Trop tard. lls sont au courant.
Les hélicoptères noirs,
les hommes gris.
Comme ceux de chez Skyvionics.
Je connais cet endroit
depuis la 2e Guerre mondiale,
il s'en passe de belles.
Que contient cette valise ?
- Des souvenirs.
- Des photos ?
En quelque sorte.
A quoi bon un ordinateur
quand on a la télé ?
Avec télécommande universelle.
Ca commande tout,
sauf votre vie.
On peut être observés
à travers la télé.
Pas de dispositif d'inversion
d'image. J'ai vérifié.
J'ai aussi pris la liberté
de programmer ça pour sauter
les chaînes à contrôle subliminal.
Vous êtes très prévenant,
M. Hollis.
Vous ne chargez pas
des images dégoûtantes, dites ?
Ca dépend de ce que vous appelez
dégoûtant.
Ca vient d'arriver
il y a quelques minutes.
J'espère que ça vaut la peine.
M. Raines. Comment a-t-il su ?
Ce doit être sur les disques
d'archives numériques
de simulation.
ll sait ce que ça signifie ?
ll s'agit de Jarod.
S'il l'ignore encore,
il comprendra vite.
C'est un génie.
On peut tirer dessus,
la malaxer,
prendre l'empreinte
d'une page de journal
et c'est vendu
dans un oeuf en plastique.
L'oeuf symbolise
la naissance de la matière.
C'est l'existence.
Ca n'est pas que de la pâte
à modeler, c'est ce qu'on veut.
Pourquoi appeler ça
''pâte à modeler universelle'' ?
Comment vous appelleriez ça ?
Je ne sais pas,
mais j'en veux.
J'en prends cent.
Super !
La famille Collins se bat seule
Bonjour, vous devez être Jarod.
Nous serions ravis de vous aider.
On voit mieux de l'intérieur.
J'ai cru sentir de la fumée.
Apparemment, tout va bien.
Tant mieux.
J'aurais jamais cru
que vous étiez pilote.
Je ne suis pas vraiment pilote.
Moi, je suis Jimmy Hoffa !
ll fallait le dire.
On aime bien savoir si on va
se faire trancher la gorge.
Ca ne semblait pas important.
Et ça, ça semble important ?
Ces hordes de singes volants
ont terrorisé
- tout le pays !
- Terrorisé ?
Du gaz hilarant.
Créé par la ClA en 1971 .
- 1969.
- Je le savais !
Vous êtes des leurs !
Vous allez arrêter ?
C'est un hallucinogène.
- C'est assez puissant.
- Plus maintenant.
Je l'ai coupé à l'oxygène.
Même votre dentiste
a des trucs plus forts.
J'en ai respiré une fois
par accident
et je me suis pris
pour Eleanor Roosevelt.
Où voulez-vous en venir ?
Vous vous rappelez
les drosophiles ?
Rien de tel.
Ferme tes portes
et tes fenêtres, amigo.
L'exterminateur arrive
et son nom est Skyvionics.
Des marchands de mort.
Croyez-moi.
J'ai été clown dans ce cirque
et c'est tout
sauf du grand spectacle !
Sacrée collection !
Nos seuls clients, c'est vous,
les gars de Skyvionics,
depuis qu'on n'a plus de base.
C'est quoi, votre poison ?
Vous buvez quoi ?
J'ai été élevé
aux nutriments optimisés :
coeurs de palmier et germe
de blé mélangés à de la tomate.
- Un Virgin Mary au céleri.
- Mettez-en deux.
J'attends quelqu'un.
Lt Ronald ''Hammer'' Collins
disparu à Clearview Ridge
Vous vous preniez pour qui,
là-haut ?
Je m'entraînais.
Vous savez de quoi je parle.
Clearview Ridge.
Je refaisais le dernier vol
de Collins.
Deux Virgin Mary.
J'espère que c'est votre poison.
Vous m'attendiez !
L'officier le plus coriace !
C'est ce qu'on m'a dit.
Alors, lieutenant Gant,
pourquoi l'armée de l'air
s'intéresse à un pilote civil ?
Vous testez un système destiné
aux pilotes militaires.
Je dois m'assurer
de sa sécurité.
Et moi, j'ai un test vendredi.
Je ne pilote
que des avions que je connais.
Je dois m'assurer
de ce que je fais.
Exact.
Apparemment, Collins avait
largement le temps de sauter.
Le temps, oui.
La capacité, non.
Son dossier prétend le contraire.
Entre vous et moi,
Collins n'a pas sauté
parce qu'il s'est évanoui.
Comment ?
Disons que le Virgin Mary
n'était pas sa boisson préférée.
C'est vrai ?
Croyez-moi sur parole
ou volez mon rapport à washington.
Ce serait impossible.
Même sa femme n'a pas protesté
et Ca lui a coûté sa pension.
Les employés de Skyvionics
ont vu Collins
- dans ce bar le soir du crash.
- Qui ?
Lawson, par exemple.
Qui d'autre ?
Tom Matthews.
Joli vol, Jarod,
revenez à la base.
Vous apprenez vraiment vite !
La chance des débutants !
On fera une grande annonce
après le test.
Scimitar va être commercialisé.
En l'an 2000, ce système sera
sur tous les avions du pays.
Je me sens déjà plus en sécurité.
Sachez que j'ai parlé de vous
aux responsables.
Vous êtes notre meilleur pilote,
et de loin.
Mais ?
Je dois opter pour Dixon.
Je comprends.
Vous ne voulez pas
reprendre un risque.
Cette fois, le pilote
ne me laissera pas tomber.
Ron Collins
vous valait tous les deux.
Mais il buvait. Je m'étonne
que ça vous ait échappé.
Je l'ai appelé
le matin du test.
ll a dit que ça allait.
Pas de défaillance mécanique ?
ll s'est évanoui car il avait
de l'alcool dans le sang.
L'avion de Collins
était au point.
J'en suis certain.
Ta maman est là ?
Vous étiez
avec Ron en Arabie Saoudite ?
Votre mari m'a sauvé la vie
à Bagdad.
Quand j'ai appris l'accident...
je suis venu
le plus vite possible.
Sachez que je suis désolé.
Avec quelques collègues,
on a fait une pétition
pour qu'on lui rende
un hommage posthume.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Rien.
C'est formidable,
vraiment formidable.
Vous avez dîné ?
Jarod aurait laissé ça pour nous ?
Quand j'ai voulu enregistrer
la photo de M. Raines,
ça a créé ce programme.
Et je pourrai communiquer
avec lui et le voir ?
Par son système de code, oui.
Je ne veux pas
que Mlle Parker l'apprenne.
Attendez un peu !
Si vous voulez jouer
à ce petit jeu
avec la reine des neiges...
allez-y. Mais pas question
que je sois de la partie.
Vous avez peur
d'y laisser votre boulot.
J'ai peur d'y laisser ma peau.
Tu manges des hot-dogs
et des macaronis tous les soirs ?
J'aimerais bien.
La vue est belle, hein ?
Voilà Orion, le chasseur
et là, c'est Pégase.
Le cheval ailé.
C'était la préférée de papa.
Je connais plein d'étoiles.
Je les observais avec papa.
On est allés les voir dans
le désert la veille de sa mort.
C'est vrai ? Rien que toi
et ton papa ?
Maman aimait pas qu'on sorte
le soir en douce. Elle savait pas.
N'oubliez pas que demain
vous pilotez un Dracon.
Où est-il ?
On le prépare au numéro 27.
A deux hangars d'ici.
Vous avez fait
combien d'heures là-dessus ?
En fait, ça sera
une première pour moi.
Jarod n'a pas perdu de temps.
Cette photo a été prise hier
par un de nos satellites.
C'est La Grange.
Une des pistes
d'atterrissage privées du Centre.
C'est tout près de washington.
Ce cliché a été pris
juste avant 2 h.
Et le numéro n'est pas fini !
- Un Draycon.
- Dracon.
ll est resté là 3 h et...
hop !
ll a atterri là en pleine nuit ?
Sans être détecté ?
3 h, ça lui laisse le temps
de visiter washington.
Pourquoi ?
Lieutenant Janice Gant
au rapport. Mission spéciale.
Simulation de combat
Collins-Matthews.
Scimitar 2, répondez.
Hammer, tu me reçois ?
5 sur 5. Le système
fonctionne à merveille.
Essayons encore une fois
à Mach 1,8.
Attrape-moi !
Je vais porter le coup fatal.
Dis tes prières, Hammer.
Arrête de voler en tonneau !
Tu as la tête en bas.
Saute, Collins.
Collins, saute !
Tu vas t'écraser !
Sors de là, Collins. Saute !
Tu ne pouvais pas sauter,
vu que Matthews t'avait donné
un avion défectueux.
Si vous ne comprenez pas,
on recommence. D'accord ?
Très bien.
Ecoutez-moi, docteur.
Si le gosse
reparle de son père,
dites-lui que son papa
l'aimait beaucoup
et qu'il est mort
dans un accident d'avion.
Ca n'est pas tout à fait faux.
C'est clair ?
Ne vous en faites pas.
C'est Jarod.
Ca va ?
Un cauchemar.
Vous ne deviez pas
charger quelque chose ?
Hiroshima ?
C'est vous.
Du grand spectacle.
J'ai participé à quelque chose
qui n'aurait pas dû se passer.
J'ai contribué à ça.
Vous ne pouviez pas savoir.
L'ignorance
est une piètre excuse
pour un meurtre.
Sur 140 chaînes, rien.
Ma femme dit que je mourrai
avec ça dans la main.
Cassée ?
Défectueuse.
Vous êtes un as
de la mécanique.
ll paraît que le taux de panne
est de 0,4%.
Et alors ?
J'ai fait mes propres calculs
et je trouve un taux de panne
de 3,1 %.
Sûrement une mauvaise puce.
C'est vous, l'expert.
C'est une puce Scimitar.
Et quand elle est défectueuse,
tout l'avion est affecté.
Contrôle de l'altitude,
rayons infrarouges,
système d'éjection.
Ronald Collins n'a pas sauté
parce qu'il ne pouvait pas.
3,1 %,
c'est le prix d'une vie humaine
chez Skyvionics ?
ll n'était pas
au bar la veille du crash,
il était dans le désert
et observait les étoiles
avec son fils.
Pourquoi avoir menti ?
J'ai averti Matthews, mais
il a trouvé le taux acceptable.
3,1 %, ça n'est rien
par rapport à l'enjeu final.
Vous avez donc trafiqué
l'enregistrement ?
Matthews voulait laisser
Gant à l'écart.
ll disait qu'il ramasserait
plein de fric avec les contrats.
Mettez-vous à ma place.
C'est déjà fait.
Qui est cet homme ?
Personne, Jarod.
Personne.
Répondez à ma question, Sydney.
Qui est-ce ?
Et que sait-il sur mon père ?
Je ne suis pas là.
Je suis content
qu'on puisse enfin parler.
L'accident d'avion n'est pas
tout à fait faux. Comment ça ?
Je sais seulement
qu'il s'appelle M. Raines.
Ecoute, j'ai fait
des recherches ici
et j'ai découvert une chose.
Ton père était aviateur.
Un aviateur
qui pilotait...
On a été coupés de l'intérieur.
C'est exact.
Suivez-moi.
Lieutenant Gant ?
lci Jarod wright.
Je veux vous montrer
quelque chose.
''Le Royaume des uniformes'' ?
J'ai une urgence.
Plier ici
Je pensais
qu'on était d'accord.
Et maintenant... ça.
ll m'a convaincu, il m'a forcé.
ll n'est pas si fort que ça.
Je peux me rattraper.
Que proposez-vous ?
Jarod a utilisé une connexion Arpa
datant des débuts d'lnternet,
quand ça relevait
du ministère de la Défense.
J'ai réussi à le localiser.
C'est un début.
On devrait commencer
dans 30 minutes.
Voilà 6 ans que j'attends d'être
impressionné par le Scimitar.
Je suis impatient.
D'après ce que j'ai vu hier,
ce sera une vraie révélation.
Vous ne trouvez pas Dixon ?
Ca ne répond pas chez lui.
ll est sûrement en route.
Que la tour de contrôle confirme
que chaque système fonctionne.
Et rappelez chez Dixon !
Rien.
Les autochtones
doivent s'impatienter.
Vous êtes prêt à vous battre ?
Moi ? Je suis né
pour ce moment-là.
- Vous connaissez la manoeuvre.
- Comme à l'entraînement.
Ne pas dépasser Mach 1
et pas de fantaisies.
On est à micro ouvert
avec la tour,
tout est diffusé.
J'y compte bien !
C'est parti.
Scimitar 2,
si vous jouiez le bandit ?
Bien reçu, Chasseur d'hommes.
Commençons
par la réflexion radar.
Le système avionique Scimitar
permettra un verrouillage
2 fois plus rapide
que les autres systèmes.
Tandis que l'avion s'éloigne,
Scimitar
prédit sa trajectoire.
Dans le ciel,
la vitesse, c'est la vie
et Scimitar, c'est la vitesse.
- Eagle, vous êtes mort.
- Je me disais bien !
Essayons encore
à Mach 1,8.
Testons vraiment ce système.
Bien reçu.
J'ai coupé les micros.
Ca va pas ?
Vous voulez
faire bonne impression ?
Suivez-moi.
lmpossible.
ll y a un taux d'échec de 3,1 %
sur chacune de mes promesses.
Ronald Collins
n'a pas eu de chance.
Attrapez-moi, Chasseur d'hommes.
Prenez-en de la graine.
Bon sang,
qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
La vérité.
J'ai perdu le contrôle.
Eagle ! Je répète.
J'ai perdu le contrôle.
Votre puce Scimitar
est défectueuse, comme celle
de l'avion de Ronald Collins.
Effrayant, pas vrai, Tom ?
Je peux pas sauter !
- Je peux pas !
- Je vous dirai comment faire,
si vous me dites la vérité.
Qu'est-ce que vous racontez ?
Alors, vous subirez
le sort de Ronald Collins.
Vous me recevez,
Chasseur d'hommes ?
ll fallait
que je fasse bonne impression.
Vous avez tué un innocent
et vous l'avez accusé.
Je ne voulais pas,
je suis désolé.
C'était un ami.
Aidez-moi.
Activez le système infrarouge.
- C'est fait.
- Désactivez le récepteur radar.
- Fait.
- Tirez le levier d'éjection.
Ca marche toujours pas !
J'ai failli oublier.
Mesdames et messieurs,
notre émission
sur Radio Skyvionics s'achève.
lci Eagle, je rends l'antenne.
C'est génial !
Le gouvernement
veut être remboursé !
Caisse d'assurance de l'Arizona
C'est dur de vivre
auprès d'un dingue.
Vous n'êtes pas fou, M. Hollis.
Je crois
tout ce que vous m'avez dit.
J'ai encore des doutes
au sujet d'Eleanor Roosevelt.
ll y a une autre information
que vous devriez étudier.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
C'est dans le Delaware.
A Blue Cove.
Un endroit appelé ''Le Centre''.
C'est la seule carte
où vous le trouverez.
C'est un endroit dangereux.
Les gens devraient le savoir,
vous voyez ce que je veux dire.
Ca alors ! Je ferai circuler.
J'y compte bien.
- Bonne chance.
- A vous aussi.
J'ignore ce que vous cherchez,
mais je vous souhaite de trouver.
Vous êtes Mlle Parker ?
Exact.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- De la pâte à modeler.
Vous avez un miroir ?
''Le pilote décédé
a été innocenté''.
Rien.
Je commence à craindre
que la combativité des Parker
ne soit pas héréditaire.
Je le trouverai.
Que ce soit parfaitement clair.
Jarod n'est pas
un inconvénient mineur
destiné à justifier vos frais
auprès du Centre.
Je comprends, M. Raines.
On vous attend, monsieur.
Servez-vous.
On reste pas un mois
dans une décharge.
M. woods en avait assez
de voyager.
ll voulait être au calme, lire.
Comme si ça rapportait...
ll lisait nuit et jour.
ll lisait quoi, exactement ?
Des livres, par centaines.
Regardez-moi ça.
- M. woods est venu avec ?
- On lui a livré
de la bibliothèque.
Des livres de mathématiques
et de sciences.
lci aussi.
Un fou de science.
Un jour, il a passé 14 h
dans son fauteuil
à lancer une pièce de 50 cents.
14 heures ?
Bizarre, hein ?
Selon lui, face tombe plus souvent
à cause de la surface
et de l'aérodynamique.
Sauf pour les pièces
de 10 cents.
ll a pas dit pourquoi.
Statistiques,
physique et probabilités.
Je vais attendre
qu'on en fasse un film.
A Chances égales.
Je peux ?
Jarod a laissé un message.
On n'est pas loin.
On est là où il veut
qu'on soit.
Pourquoi tant vouloir apprendre ?
Sacrée bonne question !
Le gars de la 9 nous tue.
J'y vais.
ll doit tricher.
ll peut pas compter 8 paquets.
Encore gagné !
ll est à combien ?
Plus de 100 000 $.
Morgan a visé son crédit.
Qui est ce type ?
lvy, venez là.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il boit ?
- Du Dr Pepper.
Offrez du Cristal,
de la Stoli...
J'ai essayé.
ll veut du Dr Pepper.
Face.
Dix de suite.
Vous me portez chance ?
Je perds toujours.
Même avec l'os du poulet.
Moi, c'est lvy.
M. Felson ?
Cinquante.
La banque reste à 17.
22. La banque gagne.
Vous voyez ? J'ai la poisse.
On a la poisse
quand on croit à la chance.
Vous croyez à la chance ?
Moi non plus.
- Je préviens M. Morgan.
- Fais-le taire.
Autant pour la poisse !
Je rejoue tout.
S'il compte les cartes,
je vois rien.
Ce n'est pas un jeu.
A Las Vegas, tout est un jeu !
C'est lui, M. Morgan.
On aime compter les cartes ?
ll s'appelle Jarod Felson.
J'ai vérifié.
Croisières à Monte-Carlo.
ll est fiché nulle part.
Je suis honoré.
M. Felson a choisi le Marquis
pour sa 1re arnaque.
Ce qui fait de M. Felson
un bel idiot.
Votre chef de la sécurité
n'a pas assez creusé.
Essayez le fichier du FBl,
à ''mafia''.
Vous faites du racket ?
Coucou, M. Morgan !
Vous saviez qu'on aurait
cette discussion.
Pas mal, pour un idiot.
Où sont vos gains ?
Je les ai fait livrer à M. Morgan
par la charmante lvy.
Vous me rendez l'argent ?
Ca ne m'intéresse pas.
Qu'est-ce qui vous intéresse ?
Je ne viens pas vous humilier
ni vous dépouiller.
Que voulez-vous ?
Vous avez un sacré système
de sécurité.
Dommage que personne
sache s'en servir.
La mise était de $1 000.
Qu'a payé le donneur ?
Une fiche blanche.
$1 000.
Voici Martin Rawlings.
Donneur ici depuis 10 ans.
- Le meilleur.
- Dommage, il va perdre sa place.
ll était prestidigitateur
dans le Kentucky.
Sa spécialité :
agilité de la main.
Une fiche de plus
au porteur.
A la serveuse.
Elle va où ?
Oubliez le porteur.
Concentrez-vous sur la fiche
qui va vers le holster
du chef de sécurité.
- M. Morgan.
- Enlevez-le.
Je bosse ici depuis 10 ans...
ll y a plus de 10 000 dollars.
Et c'est pas fini.
Un casino,
c'est toujours une cible.
Alors, M. Felson...
Que voulez-vous ?
Cinq pour cent
de ce que je vous ferai gagner.
N'oubliez pas, mesdames.
Venez me voir ce soir.
Pas de chiqué,
pas de ''hors-d'oeuvre'' gratuit.
A tout à l'heure.
Alors, Nounours,
on vient fricoter avec le King ?
J'essaie de comprendre.
Vous vous faites passer
pour un chanteur mort ?
Un chanteur !
Vous savez pas qui je suis ?
Je suis un monument.
Le Mont Rushmore en paillettes.
Personne sur cette planète
n'a jamais manqué de respect
à l'homme que vous regardez.
Un type te donne 5 $
pour peloter sa femme.
J'arrive.
Mes fans commandent.
Je dois y aller.
Merci beaucoup.
Ce sont les derniers.
Je les ai tous passés par l'unité
centrale, sans trouver de lien.
Mais Jarod a une bonne théorie
sur l'aérodynamique
de la pièce de 50 cents.
Face.
Jarod essaie
de me dire quelque chose
et ce livre est un indice.
Sacré indice !
Jarod l'a entièrement surligné !
Regardez cette page
de statistiques.
ll a repassé
tous les chiffres 8.
Le huit
est le chiffre préféré de Jarod.
ll l'appelle l'infini debout,
à cause des boucles
qui mènent l'une à l'autre,
sans fin.
ll se prend peut-être
pour Brian Boitano.
Jarod cherche un but.
ll joue à des jeux.
Des jeux ?
Avec des chiffres ?
Des jeux d'argent,
le poker...
Le baccara.
ll n'y a que quelques milliers
de casinos sur Terre.
Vous savez par où commencer ?
Je sais à qui m'adresser.
Tu as lu ça ?
C'est bien.
C'est l'histoire
d'un singe indiscret
qui s'appelle George.
ll était curieux.
Je l'ai déjà lu mille fois.
Alors, tu peux m'aider.
Qui est l'homme
au chapeau jaune ?
J'en sais rien.
Merci quand même.
Enfin...
Hanlon demande à vous voir.
A me voir ?
Vous lui avez fait économiser
plus que n'importe quel comptable.
Steve Hanlon, Jarod Felson.
Enchanté, monsieur.
Merci de votre aide.
Au Marquis, on se considère
comme une grande famille.
ll n'y a pas pire trahison
que celle de ses proches.
Très impressionnant,
votre nettoyage.
J'ai une seule question :
pourquoi ?
Pourquoi un parfait étranger
vient se mêler de mes affaires
sans prévenir ?
Je suis un admirateur.
Vous avez fait un empire
à partir de rien.
Vous écoutez les gens.
Ca me plaît.
Et vous étudiez les gens.
''Maîtrisez l'espace.''
Le titre de ma conférence.
- ll y a 12 ans.
- Onze.
C'est de là que date votre slogan
''la famille d'abord''.
- Vous y étiez ?
- Non.
Mais j'ai acheté la cassette.
Attention, Peter.
Je vais vous le voler.
Je veux m'assurer que la corruption
ne revienne pas au Marquis.
Faites-le,
à n'importe quel prix.
Ma femme, Kitty.
Jarod Felson,
le nouveau chef de la sécurité.
J'ai vu votre photo.
Kitty était danseuse.
Je dois voler M. Hanlon
un instant.
Enchantée, M. Felson.
Moi de même.
Vous voilà embauché.
J'approuve la théorie de M. Hanlon
sur la famille.
Ce qui lui plaît, dans la famille,
c'est la procréation.
ll a dépensé des millions ici
pour que les gens
passent leurs vacances
en famille.
Vous n'êtes pas d'accord ?
Dans un casino ?
Maintenant, les gens pensent
que les jeux d'argent sont bénis.
Ajoutez des jeux vidéo,
même les enfants se ruinent.
Méfiez-vous de Hanlon.
Sous ses airs de nouveau patron,
il est resté très vieille école.
Danseuse battue
Maggie Blaire dans un état critique
Danseuse dans le coma
Seule et entre la vie et la mort
Désolé d'avoir été si long, Maggie.
Les visites finissent à 20h.
Je croyais qu'elle était seule.
Plus maintenant.
Je veux pas vous blesser,
mais elle se réveillera pas.
Je sais.
Ca l'empêche pas de m'entendre.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Moi, c'est Buddy.
Enchanté.
S'il lui arrive quoi que ce soit,
appelez-moi.
Je ne voulais pas être si dur,
tout à l'heure,
mais j'ai appris
à ne pas m'attacher.
C'est bien de savoir
que quelqu'un pense à elle.
Mlle Parker, que fait-on ici ?
On vient saluer un vieil ami.
T'es content de me voir,
mais rengaine, Vito.
Sydney, dites bonjour à Johnny.
Johnny a piraté l'ordinateur
d'une de nos filiales.
ll purge 10 ans à Joliet.
Que voulez-vous ?
ll arnaque un casino.
Pas une arnaque.
ll a pas le profil.
ll a tous les profils.
Trouvez-le-moi.
- Sans moi.
- Vous n'avez pas le choix.
Je sais qu'à 15h demain,
vous expédiez
des voitures volées
au Venezuela.
Je peux appeler la douane...
Vous oseriez pas.
On parie ?
50 000 $ pour l'information.
Sans poser de question.
Bienvenue à l'hôtel des pleurs.
Vous devriez être en scène.
La scène, c'est fini pour le King.
Le casino m'a viré.
A cause de cette histoire de fil ?
Quel fil ?
La pelote.
ll paraît que la revue
ne plaisait plus.
J'ai pris 15 kg.
Vous croyez que c'est facile ?
- Je dirais que non.
- Bonne réponse !
J'ai tout sacrifié.
Par amour.
Pour faire plaisir au public.
Si les patrons du casino
se mettaient à ma place
rien qu'une heure,
ils chanteraient un autre refrain,
je vous jure !
Vous ne pouvez pas
travailler ailleurs ?
Non, mon coco.
Après 24 ans
à faire sourire les gens,
à chanter
et à faire passer
les bonnes vibrations,
c'est la fin du King.
Mais on s'est bien marré !
J'en suis sûr.
Excusez-moi. Je me déballe
et je sais même pas votre nom.
Jarod.
Felson.
Bernie Baxley.
Enchanté, Bernie Baxley.
J'ai peur.
De quoi ?
De lui.
Content de t'entendre.
Ca fait un bail.
D'où tu m'appelles ?
Vous le saurez tôt ou tard.
J'y compte.
Tu y comptes, ou tu mises ?
Quelle culture !
C'est bien de pouvoir lire
ce que je veux.
Pourquoi les jeux ?
C'est dans le courrier.
J'ai du mal à comprendre
les comptes de juillet.
ll bosse même le dimanche !
Je suis payé pour.
ll y a un gros écart
avec l'an dernier.
Surtout en juillet.
Laissez tomber.
C'est normal qu'il y ait un écart.
Une de nos danseuses
s'est fait agresser.
Nos gains ont chuté de 30%
pendant 3 jours.
C'est une anomalie.
Et une mauvaise publicité.
Heureusement, le jackpot
a sauté 2 jours après
et tout le monde est revenu.
Parfois, la chance sourit
même à la banque !
Merci de m'accompagner.
On ne marche plus seules,
depuis que Maggie...
- Celle qu'on a agressée ?
- Oui.
- Vous la connaissiez ?
- De vue.
On se croisait en coulisses.
J'ai lu qu'il n'y avait pas
de preuve de vol.
Ce soir-là, le casino était bondé.
C'était le 4 juillet.
Maggie était aux anges.
Elle avait décroché un show
à Atlantic City.
Elle allait partir ?
Apparemment.
C'est fou...
C'est arrivé juste ici.
Les gardénias...
Maggie avait toujours
un gardénia à l'oreille.
C'est bizarre,
mais chaque fois que je passe ici,
je sens le gardénia.
Soyez prudente.
C'est étrange, Sydney.
Ce n'est pas logique.
J'ai réussi à entrer.
Elle ne m'entend pas.
Le couloir est sombre.
Ca sent...
les fleurs.
Je tourne.
Vers où ?
La cuisine.
Je m'approche.
On lui a fait faire des choses
contre son gré.
- Elle a fait du mal ?
- Continue, Jarod.
Concentre-toi sur le meurtrier,
pas sur la victime.
C'est la nouvelle ou l'ancienne,
sur le lit ?
C'est la même personne.
Elle ne le pense pas.
Tu peux terminer la simulation.
Je ne sais pas
ce qu'il fait là.
ll veut tuer Norma Jean
ou Marilyn ?
Je ne sais plus.
Finis la simulation.
C'est injuste.
On ne devrait pas
mourir tout seul.
ll y a un truc qui cloche
sur cette photo.
Y a un truc qui cloche
sur cette photo aussi.
On dirait que la chance tourne.
- Merci de m'accompagner.
- C'était un plaisir.
Vous ne savez vraiment pas
qui est l'homme au chapeau jaune ?
Désolée, ma voiture est là.
- Bonne soirée.
- Merci.
On vient de livrer ça.
Allons, Sydney.
On a un avion à prendre.
On déménage ?
ll faut rester mobile.
Je pensais retourner
vers l'Est.
Du côté de Branson.
Vegas a changé.
Y a plus de place
pour un vieux roublard comme moi.
Ca...
c'est un souvenir authentique
de Graceland.
C'est très joli.
Vous devriez voir
la maison en vrai.
Le King lui a donné le nom
de sa mère.
On dit toujours
qu'Elvis s'est laissé aller,
sur la fin,
qu'il s'est désintéressé de tout.
Pour moi, c'est le contraire.
Le contraire ?
ll s'est trop investi.
ll est allé trop vite.
Tellement vite
qu'il avait pas de quoi
finir la course.
J'aurais aimé la finir
à sa place.
On ne sait jamais, Bernie.
Parfois, c'est bon
de changer de décor.
Peut-être.
Tout va bien, Maggie.
Vous n'êtes pas seule.
Où est-il ?
100 000 dollars.
- On n'avait pas dit ça.
- En fait, si.
Votre gars
est au Marquis,
un casino à Las Vegas.
J'aime envoyer les cols blancs
au pressing.
Je comprends.
J'avais pris 200 000 dollars.
Vous êtes pas cher.
Direction Las Vegas,
où chacun a sa chance, même vous.
lci l'hôpital. Restez en ligne.
Je reste en ligne.
Je voudrais payer la facture
de Maggie Blaire.
Ah bon ?
Vous savez par qui ?
Je savais que vous viendriez.
Je venais lui rendre hommage.
Et vous avez payé l'hôpital,
l'enterrement.
Vous avez trouvé la vidéo,
n'est-ce pas ?
Quoi ?
La vidéo du soir de l'agression,
celle que Peter a cachée
à la police.
Elle montre Maggie
avec votre mari.
lls avaient une liaison.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Quelqu'un qui pense
que Maggie ne méritait pas ça.
De quoi vous parlez ?
lnutile de faire
comme si de rien n'était.
Vous ne comprenez pas.
ll ne veut pas me faire mal.
Mais si.
Son casier judiciaire.
Vous n'êtes pas la première
et si on ne l'arrête pas, Maggie
ne sera pas sa dernière victime.
Je suis ici pour vous aider.
Je peux l'arrêter,
si vous m'aidez.
Je ne peux pas faire ça.
Quand je lui ai dit
que je savais qu'il l'avait tuée,
il est devenu fou.
ll m'a dit qu'il me tuerait
si j'en parlais.
Et il m'a frappée,
encore et encore...
Pourquoi s'est-il arrêté ?
Le téléphone a sonné.
Un jour,
le téléphone ne sonnera pas.
M. Hanlon ? Jarod Felson.
J'ai découvert un problème
dont j'aimerais vous parler.
Demain matin, vers 10h ?
lvy ? lci M. Felson.
J'ai un service à vous demander.
Peter ? Jarod Felson.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
J'ai découvert un problème
encore plus grave.
Encore Davis ?
Non, mais c'est grave.
Vous voudrez vous en occuper
personnellement.
On peut se voir demain matin
vers 10h ?
Absolument.
A demain.
Vous faites quoi, du 46 ?
- Quoi ?
- De tour de taille.
Du 44.
Cinq nuits sans dormir !
Trop à faire.
Les jours sont trop courts.
Jorge !
J'ai un service à vous demander.
Peter, dépêchez-vous.
ll y a 100 000 dollars
qui sortent d'ici sous votre nez.
De la part de Jarod Felson.
ll vous attend
au poste de sécurité.
Quelqu'un triche avec les fonds.
Plus de 100 000 dollars
disparaissent tous les mardis.
- Davis serait dans le coup ?
- Pas sûr.
C'est pas un boulot en solo.
Le convoyeur de fonds
est dans le coup.
Pour chaque 300 000 $
déposés officiellement,
il en dépose 100 000
dans un autre local.
Si on maintient l'arnaque,
on découvre le local
et on démasque les fraudeurs.
Pourquoi pas appeler les flics ?
Réfléchissez.
Si vous réussissez,
vous devenez
le héros de Steve Hanlon.
Au Marquis, en vitesse.
Pourquoi moi ?
Je suis nouveau, ici.
Si le convoyeur
est accueilli par le directeur,
il tombera dans le panneau.
En piste !
Où est M. Davis ?
M. Davis était mon employé.
Peter Morgan,
directeur du Marquis.
Les affaires continuent, entendu ?
Très bien.
Les affaires continuent.
Une partie au local,
le reste à la banque.
A mardi prochain.
Merci beaucoup.
C'était super.
ll est tombé dans le panneau.
ll doit être idiot.
Trouvez-le.
Vous êtes ici ?
Surprise !
Devinez ce que j'ai fait.
J'imagine.
Je faisais semblant...
ll y a beaucoup d'argent
qui sort d'ici...
Et qui va
sur votre compte en Suisse.
J'ai pas de compte en Suisse.
Transferts électroniques
de 4,6 millions de dollars.
C'est votre signature ?
Je le savais.
Dites-lui la vérité.
Je regrette, M. Hanlon.
On s'y prend un peu tard.
On en est à 4,8 millions.
Je vous ai jamais senti.
J'ai rien fait de mal.
J'ai rien fait.
J'ai rien fait de mal.
Maggie Blaire non plus.
lnspecteur Hanson.
Je cherche Peter Morgan.
ll est en réunion.
ll demande une augmentation.
Sortez par derrière !
Ne cours pas.
Tu es coincé.
Mon jour de chance.
Un problème, M. Felson ?
Deux arnaqueurs à la roulette.
Appelez la police.
Qu'on les embarque.
Lâchez-moi !
Fouillez-la.
Elle cache des fiches.
Salaud !
Je fais mon travail.
Chef de la sécurité.
Je t'aurai !
On parie ?
Pile.
L'assassin de Maggie démasqué
Un convoyeur détourne 400 000 $
Pas un bout de papier,
pas de poubelle...
Rien que ça.
Et la routine.
''A l'homme au chapeau jaune,
''de la part du singe
qui s'est enfui.''
Vous allez le libérer ?
C'est prévu.
Les êtres vivants ne sont pas faits
pour la captivité.
Maman ?
Qu'est-ce que tu dis ?
Je ne t'entends pas.
Maman ?
ll appelle toutes les 2 mn.
ll ne veut parler qu'à vous.
Prenez ce téléphone.
Quelle ligne ?
On n'attend pas Mlle Parker ?
On se passera d'elle.
Elle va me tuer.
Quelle ligne ?
La 2.
Faites durer le plus possible.
J'ai déjà un début de piste.
Allô, Jarod ?
J'ai encore fait ce rêve.
Tu vas bien ?
Continuez. On l'a presque.
Dites à Broots que
je suis un as de la radio.
C'est bizarre,
de se sentir pas à sa place
quand on sait pas
où est sa place.
Ta place est ici, Jarod.
Tu n'es pas fait
pour le monde du dehors.
Epargnez-moi votre couplet.
Le Centre sait qui je suis.
Je veux la vérité.
Nous pourrons aborder
ces questions si tu reviens
continuer ton travail.
J'aimerais vous croire.
Ce que tu crois,
ce n'est pas le problème.
- C'est quoi ?
- Les simulations que tu as volées
contiennent la seule trace
de plus de 25 ans de recherches.
Le Centre...
Je veux les récupérer.
Alors, ils... vous pourriez
envisager un échange.
Mon passé contre le vôtre.
Faites vite.
Je suis en retard.
En retard pour quoi ?
Pour la justice.
M. Holmes ?
lsaac.
Monsieur Dexter ?
Un problème ?
- Vous êtes un homme.
- Aux dernières nouvelles.
Vous vous habillez
comme une femme.
On ne vous a rien dit ?
Vous ne me connaissez pas,
je suis spécial,
mais si vous ne m'aidez pas,
ils vont me coffrer.
Je n'ai rien fait de mal.
lls voulaient me tuer.
Je me suis défendu, c'est tout.
Si vous me laissez tomber,
je suis mort.
Ne vous en faites pas, M. Dexter.
Je vous défendrai.
Je savais que vous étiez bon.
Tenez.
Votre mascara coule.
- Avocat depuis longtemps ?
- Environ 7 mn.
Entrez donc.
On voulait te féliciter
pour ta victoire.
La chance des débutants...
Ton client était canon.
C'était bien ?
Ne vous laissez pas intimider.
Les nouveaux
se font toujours chahuter.
C'est honorable
de défendre de pauvres innocents.
Même s'ils sont en robe.
Michael Metzger vous attend.
Merci, Annie.
Heureusement,
un client ni pauvre ni innocent.
A propos d'innocents,
où en est l'appel de whittaker ?
Je passe 70 h par semaine sur
la fusion Metzger. Je suis débordé.
Dumont est féroce,
mais il oublie parfois
qui signe sa feuille de paie.
Je m'en occupe.
Au cas où ça t'intéresse,
on solde la lingerie,
dans les grands magasins.
Continuez comme ça.
Je ferai de mon mieux.
Faites une chose pour moi.
- Tu as une minute ?
- Je blaguais.
Je sais. Ca concerne
le procès whittaker.
Sloane a perdu un procès
pour meurtre
et ça me retombe sur le dos.
Pourquoi occuper
son meilleur avocat
pour un appel à la portée
d'un étudiant ?
Sloane tient à ce dossier.
ll déteste perdre.
Je peux rédiger l'appel.
Tu es débordé.
Et Ca m'entraînerait.
ll me tuera s'il apprend
que j'ai refilé ça à un nouveau.
Je garderai le secret.
Parlons-en.
Trouvez-moi Dumont
ou j'y vais moi-même !
Base-toi
sur mes précédents appels.
C'est toi le chef.
Pas encore.
J'y travaille.
M. Metzger...
J'étais en ligne avec le juge.
Tout ira bien.
Parfait.
Vous avez minci ?
Madame la directrice,
Jarod ne demande
qu'un petit bout de son passé.
Si nous acceptions
son offre d'échange,
cela rétablirait la confiance
dont j'ai besoin
pour le ramener.
Et les services secrets ?
Mlle Parker pense
qu'avec les armes, on a tout.
Je connais Jarod.
Plus on le chassera,
plus il fuira.
J'en discuterai avec la Tour,
mais je ne promets rien.
ll faut une seule couleur
par côté ?
Où étiez-vous en 1980 ?
Je menais une vie recluse.
Depuis quand
vous ne fumez plus ?
Comment savez-vous ?
Les mains qui tremblent,
la nicotine sur les ongles,
l'irritabilité.
Essayez un bain salé.
Le sel fait sortir
le goudron et la nicotine.
Du sel !
Vous êtes médecin et avocat ?
Et bientôt chef indien.
Vous pourriez transcrire ça
et me les livrer
sur mon bateau ce soir ?
Ce soir ? Non, M. Sloane.
lmpossible. Ma fille...
Est charmante et sait que sa mère
est indispensable ici.
Annie est la meilleure.
Annie, faites ceci,
faites cela...
Je suis comme sa femme,
déduction faite
des bénéfices.
C'est plus dur d'arrêter la paie
que le tabac.
Vous vouliez quelque chose ?
Bradley Dumont m'a demandé
de revoir un dossier.
Marcus whittaker.
M. Sloane a fait ranger
ces dossiers au sous-sol.
lmpossible d'y trouver
quoi que ce soit.
Rien n'est impossible.
Que faites-vous ici ?
Je me disais
que vous étiez gentil.
Je voulais vous remercier.
Me remercier ?
Mon carrosse.
ll est magnifique.
ll le sera
après mes 37 traites.
Alors, je l'échangerai
contre une limousine.
J'offre un service inestimable.
Les taxis prennent rarement
des hommes en robe.
Pourquoi ?
En fait,
je vous offre mes services
de chauffeur personnel.
Sans blague ?
C'est génial.
Vous avez le permis ?
Vous êtes
entre de bonnes mains.
Je promets de me comporter
en dame.
- Eh, poupée !
- Je t'emmerde, ducon !
Très bien.
Sydney... un mot.
Vous pouvez m'expliquer ?
C'est rien du tout.
Une expérience
sur les ondes cérébrales alpha,
très prometteuse.
Je ne parle pas de ça.
Vous avez vu la directrice ?
Répondez à ma question.
Jarod veut négocier.
Négocier ?
ll veut une partie de la vérité.
Ce serait humain.
Vous n'avez pas à donner
de leçons d'humanité,
après avoir enfermé Jarod
Je romps votre marché.
Ensuite, je trouverai Jarod.
Et j'en finirai
une fois pour toutes.
Tout le monde est critique.
Cette musique
vous donne pas des frissons ?
Elle est très... triste.
C'est le blues, chéri.
Le blues ? Ca me plaît.
Ca parle de la vie,
de la douleur, de la vérité.
- La vérité, c'est bien.
- Oui. Regardez-moi.
Je sors tous les jours
comme une cible.
Je dis au monde :
''Je suis comme ça.
C'est à prendre ou à laisser.''
- Une question...
- Pourquoi je m'habille comme ça ?
Ca attire l'attention.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi,
mais c'est bien pour moi.
J'ai grandi normalement.
Je jouais au foot,
j'avais des nanas.
Mais je ne me suis trouvé
que comme ça.
Ca n'a pas été facile.
- Alors, pourquoi le faire ?
- C'est moi.
On ne peut pas
faire semblant éternellement.
Un jour, on ne sait plus
qui on est.
Pas vrai ?
Concierge handicapé mental
arrêté pour meurtre
Marcus Whittaker condamné
pour le meurtre d'Audrey Price
On cherche qui ?
Un certain Marcus whittaker.
Un ami à vous ?
Pas vraiment.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a fait ?
Rien.
Rien du tout.
Après réflexion,
la Tour accepte le marché.
Vous n'êtes pas sérieuse ?
Vous savez que si.
Le président le saura.
Votre père a voté pour.
L'information demandée
sera sur votre bureau
dans l'heure.
Usez-en à bon escient.
- Ne rate pas les terroristes.
- J'ai encore fait ce rêve.
Ce n'est qu'un rêve.
Oublie-le et concentre-toi.
C'est possible d'oublier
qui on est et d'où on vient ?
Dans ce rêve,
je ne vois pas
le visage de ma mère.
Elle étend le linge.
Attention.
Le temps presse.
Les otages comptent sur toi.
Je veux la voir.
Je veux voir son visage.
Finis la simulation
et tu le verras.
Promis ?
Promis.
Je ne peux pas
terminer la mission.
Je risque de toucher un otage.
De tuer un innocent.
Parfois, Jarod,
il faut sacrifier une vie
pour en sauver d'autres.
Le suspect Marcus Whittaker,
accusé d'avoir battu à mort
Audrey Price,
a été arrêté tôt ce matin
dans sa loge
dans les quartiers ouest
de Los Angeles.
Whittaker
a un bienfaiteur exceptionnel :
son employeur, Michael Metzger,
propriétaire de l'immeuble
où le meurtre a eu lieu.
On va rester ici longtemps ?
La mort d'Audrey Price
est tragique,
mais Whittaker n'a pas à pâtir
de la mollesse de l'enquête.
Je suis heureux
que Ben Sloane le défende.
M. Metzger était sur mon bateau
quand il a su
qu'un meurtre avait eu lieu
dans son immeuble.
J'ai offert mes services.
lsaac, on va faire les boutiques.
Là, on se comprend !
Ca craint.
ll fait ça depuis
près d'une heure.
Vise un peu sa copine.
C'est toutes
vos chaussures de bateau ?
Je les prends toutes.
Vous voulez 7 paires ?
Vous avez ce modèle en 46 ?
Alors ?
Je l'ai fait.
Comme vous avez dit.
Et ?
Je l'ai traîné
derrière mon vélo.
Excellent.
Ah oui... cinq dollars.
C'est ça.
J'ai des amis.
On peut abîmer votre voiture,
si vous voulez.
Je te préviendrai.
M. Whittaker
est le seul coupable possible.
La défense n'a aucune preuve
du contraire.
Erreur, M. Edwards.
Merci. Bonne lecture.
Vous l'avez traîné
derrière une voiture ?
J'ai payé un gosse
pour le faire.
En fait, c'est ma bible.
Je suis flatté.
A qui je le dédicace ?
John Coney, Junior.
J'en connaissais un à Dartmouth.
Vous êtes...
Coupable. Mon père
m'a beaucoup parlé de vous.
...et votre père, aussi saoul
que nu, arpentait le dortoir
en criant : ''Banzaï !''
Cher vieux père...
Je n'ai jamais vu
de meilleur plaideur.
ll disait ça de vous.
J'ai admiré votre victoire
contre Sloane.
- L'affaire whittaker.
- Sloane avait rien.
Et l'empreinte de chaussure ?
- Comment savez-vous ?
- J'ai fait un exposé
sur l'affaire.
J'ai lu le dossier.
5 000 pages ?
5 612, pour être exact.
Michael Metzger
paie à whittaker l'avocat
le plus cher et il se plante.
On n'en revenait pas.
Le procureur a vu l'empreinte ?
On l'avait communiquée
avant le procès.
On attendait que Sloane
joue la carte pour créer le doute,
mais ce n'est jamais venu.
Vous n'avez rien dit ?
Des témoins disaient whittaker
amoureux d'Audrey Price.
ll y avait ses empreintes
chez elle.
On l'a pris en train
de nettoyer le sang
sur ses habits. Pas besoin
d'être Proust pour faire le lien.
Mais on n'a jamais trouvé
l'arme du crime.
whittaker
est coupable de meurtre.
Sloane n'est coupable
que d'avoir été mauvais avocat.
M. Sloane est venu
au commissariat.
ll a été gentil avec moi.
ll m'a apporté un sandwich.
Tu fais quoi ?
Des pendules en carton.
Un correspondant m'a appris ça.
Ca marche.
Mais c'est mieux avec des cartes.
Le papier qu'on me donne
est trop mou.
Je peux les garder ?
J'ai des questions à te poser
sur ton procès.
M. Sloane est mon avocat.
Je veux l'aider.
Et t'aider, toi.
Peux-tu me dire
pourquoi tu as fui
quand Audrey Price a été tuée ?
Je voulais pas
retourner en prison.
Tu avais eu des ennuis
quand tu habitais chez ta mère ?
Des garçons se moquaient d'elle.
Je devais les empêcher.
Je voulais pas leur faire mal.
J'ai dû aller à Milltown.
Le centre de détention ?
Maintenant, parle-moi
de la nuit du meurtre.
J'apportais des fleurs
à Mlle Price,
comme tous les jours.
Je finissais tard.
Elle me donnait toujours
2$ de pourboire
Mais cette fois quand je suis entré,
j'ai vu son corps par terre.
Ca va, n'aie pas peur.
Elle était toute tordue.
Son visage était en sang.
Le hibou était à côté d'elle.
Le hibou ?
En pierre. ll était vert.
Mlle Price avait toute la famille.
Elle les posait
sur sa table basse.
Elle avait l'air tranquille.
Elle avait l'air de dormir...
à part le sang.
- Tu l'aimais bien ?
- Elle était gentille.
Les avocats disent
que je voulais la toucher,
mais je la trouvais
juste gentille.
Tu avais remarqué
si elle avait de la visite,
des petits amis ?
M. Metzger venait la voir
à midi, presque chaque jour.
ll avait une chouette
voiture noire,
avec des roues brillantes
et décapotable.
Tu as parlé à M. Sloane
ou à la police
des visites de M. Metzger ?
M. Sloane m'a dit
de ne rien dire,
que c'était pas bon.
M. Sloane veille sur moi.
Ca marche vraiment.
ll est 21H20
et Metzger a tué une femme.
Qui appelle-t-il ?
lci Benjamin Sloane au port.
J'aimerais être sur mon bateau,
maisje travaille pour le payer.
Laissez un message.
Je vous rappellerai.
Je ne pige pas
pourquoi Sloane mettrait
un pauvre innocent en prison.
Pour protéger un riche coupable.
C'est l'heure, Sydney.
Je veux une réponse.
Mlle Parker est furieuse.
Elle s'est retirée de l'affaire
car le Centre a accepté
ton offre.
Ton information
en échange des disques.
lls ont dit ça ?
Nous - toi et moi -
avons la garantie
du président et de la directrice.
Je te l'envoie.
J'espère que c'est
ce qu'il te faut.
C'est elle ?
C'est ma mère ?
Oui, c'est elle.
Je vous retrouve à l'endroit
et à l'heure convenus.
Votre client ne témoignera pas
pour sa défense ?
M. Whittaker souffre
d'un sérieux handicap.
Nous avons pensé
que ça le défavoriserait.
Que pensez-vous des chances
de l'accusation ?
Cette délibération augure mal
de ses chances.
D'autant qu'on n'a pas trouvé
l'arme du crime.
Je me demande pourquoi.
Tu peux relire mon topo ?
J'ai un peu modifié tes notes.
Tu as quoi ?
J'ai revu le dossier.
ll y a des zones à explorer.
Pas du tout.
Copie mon papier,
change la date,
copie ma signature
et apporte ça au juge pour 17h.
Si tu peux pas,
je trouverai un singe qui saura.
C'est ça, Brad.
T'énerve pas, vieux.
Dans ces moments,
faut croire au destin.
La poisse...
rencontre la chance.
Mon carrosse.
Ma mère m'a écrit.
Elle est malade.
Ne t'en fais pas.
Tu la verras bientôt.
Promis. Mais d'abord,
il faut aller au tribunal
une dernière fois.
M. Sloane y sera aussi.
Je dois faire quoi ?
Fais-moi confiance.
Alors, ce déjeuner ?
Extrêmement profitable.
Mon arrivée en limousine
n'a rien gâté.
Excusez-moi, mais c'est pas
la route pour aller au cabinet.
ll fait tellement beau.
On peut faire un tour.
Un tour ?
Où ça ?
Dans l'affaire Beaumont
contre Marks watch...
Félicitations pour l'appel
de whittaker.
D'après Dumont, le nouveau
procès est gagné d'avance.
ll a de nouvelles preuves
à présenter.
Des preuves ?
ll pense avoir un mandat
pour l'arme du crime demain.
- Où est Dumont ?
- ll n'est pas rentré.
ll déjeunait avec lra Klein,
l'avocat...
Je sais qui c'est !
Trouvez-le...
Je veux savoir où est Dumont !
C'est un kidnapping.
Je suis un grand avocat.
Ca vous coûtera 150 km
de plus, maître !
L'alibi en béton
M. Metzger
était sur mon bateau...
Je voudrais réserver un vol
pour Los Angeles.
ll s'agit
d'une priorité absolue...
J'aimerais le numéro
du Los Angeles Chronicle.
La rubrique de la ville.
Annie, faites une chose
pour moi.
Non. J'écoutais
de vieux enregistrements.
L'audience est demain à 9h ?
Nous n'attendons pas M. Dumont ?
Oui, je comprends.
Je serai là à la 1re heure.
Comme une pendule.
Annie, priorité absolue.
Faites une chose
sur mon bateau.
Annie, priorité absolue.
Faites une chose sur mon bateau.
Prenez-en de la graine, Jarod.
Vous ne verrez pas Ca de sitôt.
Je suis impatient, monsieur.
Pourquoi la presse est là ?
Je ne peux encore rien dire,
mais il y aura des surprises.
Au palais de justice.
Vous pensez que le Centre
négocierait avec Jarod ?
L'arroseur arrosé.
C'est de bonne guerre.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fait là ?
Je l'ai invité.
Dans l'affaire whittaker,
la défense a de nouvelles preuves
à présenter.
M. Holmes est un avocat débutant.
ll ne représente pas ce client.
J'ai rédigé la requête
et mené les recherches.
Désigner un autre avocat
risquerait de nuire
à Marcus whittaker.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Je rends justice à un innocent.
Assez !
Quel avocat choisissez-vous ?
C'est terminé, Mr Sloane.
Appelez votre témoin.
La défense appelle
Benjamin Sloane.
Vous avez défendu
Marcus whittaker
du mieux que vous avez pu ?
Absolument.
ll n'y a eu aucune fuite ?
ll n'y a pas de ''fuite''
dans mon cabinet.
Décrivez votre relation
avec Michael Metzger.
C'est un client.
Saviez-vous qu'il avait une liaison
avec Audrey Price
à l'époque du meurtre ?
Avez-vous une preuve ?
Marcus whittaker
est prêt à témoigner.
Où voulez-vous en venir ?
Vous vous êtes donné du mal
pour établir
que M. Metzger était sur
votre bateau à l'heure du crime.
Je ne me suis donné aucun mal.
ll était là.
A quelle heure a été tuée
Mlle Price ?
Entre 21H et 21H15,
si ma mémoire est bonne.
lntéressant.
Alors, pourquoi
M. Metzger vous a appelé
sur votre bateau
à 21H20,
le soir où il était avec vous ?
Puis-je voir ceci, Mr Holmes ?
Continuez.
Veuillez noter
que le procureur
a enregistré cette photo
prise sur le lieu du crime.
M. Sloane, pourquoi le jury
ne l'a jamais vue ?
La police n'a pas trouvé
d'où elle venait.
Elle ne prouvait rien.
Je vais pouvoir aider la police.
C'est une chaussure de bateau
de taille 44.
Vous étiez sur votre bateau,
M. Sloane ?
Maintenant, je suis l'assassin ?
Non, son ange gardien.
Venons-en au tueur.
C'est du harcèlement.
- M. Sloane est jugé ?
- Pas officiellement.
Pas encore.
J'aime ce moment.
Taille 44.
Chaussure de bateau
trouvée chez M. Sloane.
- Ca ne prouve rien.
- Non.
Mais ça, oui.
L'arme du crime.
Tachée du sang
de la victime.
Que faisait l'arme du crime
sur votre bateau ?
C'est insensé.
Michael Metzger
n'est pas de cet avis.
Vous le faites chanter
depuis le procès.
M. Metzger a battu
Audrey Price à mort
et a demandé à M. Sloane
de nettoyer.
Sauf qu'avant vous,
M. whittaker est arrivé.
ll a trouvé la victime,
il a paniqué
et s'est enfui.
Vous avez envoyé un innocent
en prison.
Si j'ai oublié un détail,
ne vous gênez pas.
Aucune de ces preuves
ne résistera à un bon avocat.
Je vous suggère
d'en trouver un.
Vous êtes inculpé
de complicité de meurtre.
Je lance un mandat d'arrêt
contre Michael Metzger.
Quelle loi exercez-vous ?
La loi qui s'applique aussi
aux millionnaires.
Félicitations, Marcus.
Te voilà libre.
Allez-y, Sam.
On le cueillera en bas.
Pas si vite.
J'ai un permis.
Dégagez !
Par ici !
Mince !
La prochaine fois,
je lui tire dessus.
Vous avez triché.
En voiture.
Par ici, M. Metzger.
Je veux voir mon avocat !
Je veux voir mon avocat !
Vous avez de la chance.
Comment tu es venue ?
On m'a envoyé un billet.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Une pendule en carton.
''Tu as tout le temps
pour toi.
''Veille bien sur ta liberté.
''Ton correspondant, Jarod.''
- Prêt ?
- Huit secondes.
C'est bon.
Huit secondes.
C'est parti !

Qu'est-ce que je fais là ?
Tu vas étudier des photos.
C'est un guerrier ?
Oui, un soldat
en Asie du Sud-est.
Pourquoi je dois le regarder ?
Certaines personnes
croient que cette photo
a été fabriquée.
Je veux avoir ton avis.
ll a peur.
ll est triste.
ll a disparu,
ses proches se demandent
s'il est en vie.
Comme pour mes parents ?
Pourquoi vous intéressez-vous
à M. Starr ?
C'est une affaire de famille.
Pourriez-vous décrire
son comportement, son humeur ?
Je vais vous dire,
ce type avait
plusieurs facettes.
En arrivant, il touchait pas
une bille en armes.
Et en moins de 24 h...
il fait ça.
1 0 : 1 9.
Elles sont toutes comme ça.
Va savoir ce que ça signifie !
ll y avait aussi les balles.
- Comment ça ?
- ll payait
pour les retirer du mur.
ll disait qu'il voulait
les étudier, c'était son truc.
Je l'ai dit, ce type avait...
Plusieurs facettes.
ll a dit où il allait ?
ll logeait au motel
près de la route. Allez voir.
- Je peux ?
- On est en démocratie.
Quand vous le verrez,
donnez-lui son jouet.
Après les séances de tir,
il faisait rouler ça partout.
C'était qu'un grand enfant.
Marrant, hein ?
Hilarant.
J'ai doublé le camion trop vite ?
Vous m'avez doublé trop vite.
Je veux voir mon avocat !
Calme-toi, c'est compris ?
Ferme-la et ne bouge pas.
Tu veux un café ?
Voyons ça.
Déjà trois arrestations !
Tu sais ce que ça veut dire ?
- Direct en prison ?
- Félicitations.
C'est un peu dur,
vu que tu as
seulement pris 6,3 $
à une vieille dame.
Et tu as failli t'en tirer.
Quel crack !
Mon café !
Ca a dû faire mal.
Tu vois ?
- Mets-le dans sa cage.
- Attention à sa chemise !
Bien joué.
- Carl Bishop.
- Enchanté. Frank Meyers.
Jarod Starr, avec deux ''r''.
Comme Ringo.
- Qui est Ringo ?
- C'est marrant.
Je ne vous ai jamais vu.
ll arrive de Chicago.
Vous êtes en retard
et j'attends votre dossier.
J'allais vous en parler.
On avait rendez-vous.
On était occupés.
Dépêchez-vous !
On a déjà parlé de ça.
Tout de suite.
- ll lui faut un passe-temps.
- Elle fait son boulot.
A plus tard, Chicago.
- Volontiers.
- Enchanté.
J'ai raté un truc ?
C'est l'lGS.
Elle en fait partie ?
lnspecteur Swindell.
Ne vous faites pas d'idées,
Roméo.
Elle est intouchable.
Vous parliez de votre dossier.
La paperasse, vous savez
ce que c'est. ll va arriver.
En attendant les documents,
vous aurez un bureau
en guise de moto.
Ne me faites pas douter de vous.
Moi ? Je suis innocent
comme l'agneau.
Au travail !
Je peux vous aider ?
Avez-vous remarqué la couleur...
Double arbre à cames en tête ?
Pardon ?
Vous trafiquez
les têtes de cylindre, hein ?
J'aimerais bien gonfler
ma pupuce !
- Votre pupuce ?
- Ma bécane !
Je voulais ouvrir
les blocs-cylindres,
mais ma pension avait du retard.
Mill, t'assures !
Petits chenapans !
Je les ai rencontrés
à Jacksonville.
Mildred Reynolds.
Millie pour les amis.
Auriez-vous remarqué la couleur
du feu au carrefour ?
Quel feu ?
Le petit génie
est parti depuis trois jours.
ll n'a laissé que ça.
Où est le chauffeur ?
Au petit coin.
Ce type
a une vessie d'écureuil.
Quoi encore ?
Bonjour, mademoiselle.
Pouvez-vous
enlever votre veste ?
Plaît-il ?
Je voudrais
que vous enleviez votre veste.
- Pas question.
- S'il vous plaît.
Vous êtes viré !
Sachez que j'ai vu Délivrance.
Faites un petit tour.
Pas mal du tout !
Passons les menottes à la dame.
Je vous arrête pour infraction
au code pénal, article 369-7.
C'est quoi, ça ?
Port d'arme illégal.
C'est écrit dans le livre.
Surligné en jaune.
Vous allez nous suivre.
Jarod !
Si je comprends bien,
ça, c'est une partie de ça,
mais c'est vendu séparément ?
Vous avez compris.
Beignet, trou de beignet.
Sans vouloir être tatillon,
si le trou est là,
pourquoi appeler ça le trou ?
Je me le demande aussi.
Mais ne dites rien au patron.
Promis.
J'en reprends un.
Offert par la maison.
Je préfère le manger ici.
Bonjour, M. Kembrook !
ll a l'air très triste.
ll n'est plus le même
depuis la mort de Marvin.
- Marvin ?
- Son fils.
ll était vigile
dans une bijouterie
et s'est fait tuer
en tentant de la braquer.
Vous connaissez bien la famille.
Depuis que je suis née.
Du moins, M. Kembrook.
Je ne comprends pas.
Les Kembrook ont fait adopter
Marvin à sa naissance.
A la mort de sa femme,
M. Kembrook a cherché son fils.
ll l'a trouvé il y a 6 mois.
ll a dû être très heureux.
lls l'étaient tous les deux.
En fait, Marvin aussi
cherchait ses parents.
Rencontrer ses parents
à l'âge adulte, c'est fou !
Ce doit être très émouvant.
Même après tout ce temps,
ils s'adoraient.
- Qu'en savez-vous ?
- lls étaient du même sang.
ll n'y a rien de plus fort.

Recherche de personnes disparues
On a peut-être trouvé
votre fille.
Mon équipe part pour New York.
Si tout va bien,
vous l'embrasserez demain.
Que Dieu vous bénisse aussi.
Je peux vous aider ?
Je ne sais pas qui je suis.
Si je comprends bien...
on m'a arrêtée
à cause d'un appel anonyme ?
Comment savez-vous que
cette personne disait vrai ?
ll semblait honnête.
C'est officiel.
Je suis en enfer.
Vous aviez bien une arme,
ma jolie.
Et vous sortirez
dès que le juge reviendra
de son tournoi
et qu'on aura les papiers.
C'est quand, au juste ?
Après-demain.
Tout le service juridique
du Centre
est en séminaire
dans le Sud de la France.
On doit attendre au moins 72 h
pour joindre un avocat.
ll le savait.
Bon sang,
il complote quelque chose
et doit m'écarter
pendant trois jours.
1 0 : 1 9...
C'est peut-être un horaire.
Oubliez ça !
Contentez-vous
de me trouver un avocat.
N'importe quel avocat.
Les disparitions tombent souvent
dans une de ces catégories :
enlèvement, fugue ou abandon.
Je cherche mes parents.
Pourquoi avoir pensé à moi ?
Vous avez réuni un père
et son fils 25 ans après.
Je vous préviens,
ça n'arrive pas toujours.
On prend un risque
en cherchant son passé.
On peut être déçu.
Je suis prêt à tout
pour découvrir la vérité.
lls sont toujours vivants ?
Jarod, est-ce qu'il est
toujours vivant ?
Les yeux.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils ont ?
ll a envie de pleurer...
mais il ne peut pas.
Pourquoi ?
ll se sent seul,
oublié.
ll s'en moque.
De quoi ?
De lui.
ll a abandonné.
Je n'abandonnerai pas, Sydney.
Je n'abandonnerai jamais.
M. Starr ?
Jarod...
Savez-vous
si vos parents sont en vie ?
Je ne sais pas.
On m'a toujours caché la vérité.
Pourquoi ne pas utiliser
les fichiers de la police ?
Je ne peux pas.
C'est dur à comprendre,
mais j'ai peu de temps.
72 heures.
Sans nom...
J'ai une photo.
C'est ma mère.
Enfin, à ce qu'on m'a dit.
Mon père aurait été aviateur.
Dans l'armée ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je vais essayer.
Merci.
ll y a un groupe.
Des gens comme vous.
ll y a une réunion ici
demain soir.
Ca aide,
de savoir qu'on n'est pas seul.
Vous vouliez un avocat ?
Henry !
C'est une plaisanterie !
Maître Henry J. Munroe Jr.
Le meilleur avocat
de Cedar Point,
mais aussi le seul avocat
de Cedar Point.
ll le savait.
Je ne peux rien y faire.
Vous comprenez pas.
Autant me condamner à mort !
Millie ?
Enfin
quelqu'un qui a un peu
de cervelle !
Vous la connaissez ?
Un peu. Que se passe-t-il ?
J'ai accidentellement bousculé
le fourgon à viande
sur Biscayne Boulevard
et on veut me clouer au sol
et me jeter dans le caniveau !
Elle a heurté une ambulance vide
et on lui retire
son permis de conduire.
Vous pouvez nous laisser ?
Volontiers.
Je me méfie d'elle
comme de la peste.
C'est très grave, Millie.
Et si l'ambulance avait transporté
quelqu'un à l'hôpital ?
Je ne veux faire de mal
à personne.
Mon mari est mort.
Mes enfants sont tous partis.
J'ai 73 ans
et je suis seule.
Me prendre ma moto,
c'est me prendre
mon indépendance.
Et alors,
autant m'enterrer,
parce que j'en mourrai.
Un ravissant trio
de rubis, émeraude et saphir
bordé de diamants.
- Combien Ca coûte ?
- 4 000 dollars seulement.
Ca n'est pas assez.
J'ai également
ce magnifique diamant princesse
entouré de brillants
à 5 000 dollars.
Ce qui ferait 5 328 dollars,
taxe incluse.
Parfait.
Je la prends.
Vous savez que cet achat
dépasse le seuil autorisé
pour la carte ?
C'est voulu.
Une quête du passé
a connu dans la matinée
un dénouement plein d'émotion.
Harold Kembrook attendait
nerveusement que le taxi s'ouvre
pour voir son fils
qu'il a fait adopter
il y a 25 ans de cela.
ll se trouve que son fils,
Marvin Howard Kembrook,
était à la recherche
de son identité depuis 11 ans.
Cette scène émouvante
avait pour témoin
Susan Granger,
celle qui les a réunis.
Un instant.
C'est moi.
Vous avez commandé
des beignets ?
- Des Suprêmes à la framboise ?
- Possible.
Ca devrait suffire.
Je vais me risquer à supposer
que vous adorez les beignets.
C'est bon.
Vous êtes flic ?
Comment vous savez ?
Très drôle.
lnspecteur Swindell ?
Pas de ''Joyeux Anniversaire'',
je ne connais pas les paroles.
Vous avez lu mon dossier.
- C'est mon boulot.
- Un bavarois.
Je pensais à un Suprême,
mais il n'y en a plus.
Celui-ci est très bon.
On sympathise rarement
avec l'lGS.
En fait, j'aimerais
être transféré à l'lGS
et tout candidat
doit étudier un dossier...
- Vous voulez mon aide.
- On vous dit minutieuse.
Vous pensez
à une affaire en particulier ?
En effet.
Vous ne mangez pas ?
D'après le rapport,
Bishop et Meyers sont allés
à la bijouterie pour le casse.
lls ont trouvé Kembrook,
le vigile, en plein cambriolage
avec un complice.
Ce complice tire sur Kembrook
et prend la fuite.
C'est plus un homicide non résolu
qu'une affaire pour l'lGS.
Tout a été passé au peigne fin.
On n'a trouvé aucune empreinte.
C'était donc
un complice efficace ?
Si jamais vous entrez à l'lGS,
sachez
qu'il faut se mettre à la place
des intéressés.
Marvin Kembrook a passé sa vie
dans des foyers.
A 18 ans, il entre dans l'armée.
C'était un des plus mauvais
éléments de son unité.
En 10 ans,
il n'est pas passé caporal.
Pas un grand cerveau criminel !
ll s'agit d'un jeune homme venant
de découvrir son identité.
ll avait 2 000 dollars
sur son compte.
ll aurait gâché tout ça ?
Si vous croyez Kembrook innocent
et le complice fictif,
qui est coupable ?
La seule pièce à conviction,
c'est la balle qui a tué Marvin.
Trouvez l'arme qui l'a tirée,
vous aurez le tueur.
Bon sang !
Encore en retard !
Je vais me faire sonner
les cloches si on me voit.
Tu peux m'aider ?
- Comment ?
- J'ai mon dossier de transfert.
Donne-le au brigadier,
après mon départ.
Pas de problème.
Je ne connais
encore personne ici.
On pourrait déjeuner ensemble.
- C'est moi qui invite.
- Demain ?
Parfait.
Quoi de neuf, mon vieux ?
Ca va.
Lis ça. On a trouvé
le type qu'on cherchait.
Ca fait presque
11 ans que mon fils a disparu.
Pas un jour ne s'écoule
sans que je croie le voir...
au coin d'une rue
ou dans un bus.
Tous mes amis me disent
de laisser tomber.
Mais comment peut-on se renier ?
Comment peut-on...
tourner le dos à sa propre vie ?
C'est impossible.
On vient ici
depuis plus d'années
qu'aucun de nous
ne veut l'avouer.
Vous savez
ce qui est arrivé à mon fils.
Je suis là pour vous dire
de ne jamais abandonner,
cherchez ceux que vous aimez,
ça en vaut la peine,
même si ça n'est
que pour un moment.
On est là...
à dire combien ils nous manquent
et combien on les aime.
Mais finalement, je crois...
que ce sont les petites choses
qui manquent le plus.
La façon dont on se voit
dans nos enfants.
Sa façon de s'asseoir,
son rire...
sa façon de touiller le café.
N'abandonnez jamais.
Jamais.
- Regardez où vous allez !
- J'allais nulle part !
Ne criez pas,
je suis pas sourde !
Seulement aveugle !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Mémé a failli me couper en deux
avec son tricycle !
Ca suffit.
Vous, restez là.
Et vous, venez avec moi.
C'est tout ?
Du papier de verre
et de la peinture suffiront.
Vous êtes assuré ?
Oui, mais pas question
que la vieille s'en tire !
Qu'est-ce que je vois ?
Une plaque périmée.
Ca fait 100 dollars d'amende.
Et je pourrais fouiller
votre véhicule.
Du papier de verre
et de la peinture...
Bonne journée.
Quant à vous, jeune fille,
suivez-moi.
Où ça ?
Là.
OPTlClEN
Et après ?
Ma femme a fait ses valises
et s'est tirée.
Tu plaisantes !
- Pourquoi j'inventerais ça ?
- C'est fou !
Quand je l'ai revue,
c'était chez un avocat.
Je connais ça.
Ta 3e femme ?
La 4e.
- Tu as mille gosses ?
- Non, six gosses formidables.
- lls se ressemblent tous.
- Ferme-la !
Les fins de mois
doivent être dures.
Je veille sur tout le monde.
ll y a forcément
une meilleure solution.
Chicago ?
On est courant de l'argent
que tu récoltais
dans les quartiers sud.
Vous avez lu mon dossier !
Tu es nouveau.
Tu en ferais autant.
Vous n'aviez pas le droit.
On a rien prouvé.
Ca prouve que tu sais
brouiller les pistes.
Frank et moi, on cherche
du renfort. Pas vrai ?
Exact.
ll faut être un flic à part
pour ça.
On pense que tu fais l'affaire.
Désolé, monsieur,
votre carte de crédit
ne passe pas.
lmpossible.
Mettez-la dans le bon sens.
Je connais mon boulot.
J'ai essayé trois fois.
ll y a sûrement une erreur,
je paie toujours par carte.
ll n'y a pas d'erreur.
On va devoir payer sa caution
avant qu'il s'enfuie en tirant !
Je dois emmener mon fils
au base-ball.
Passe nous voir,
on discutera. D'accord ?
- Je vais réfléchir.
- C'est ça.
Tu as un petit truc ici.
Merci pour le déjeuner.
La photo de votre mère
nous amène dans le Delaware.
- Ca vous dit quelque chose ?
- C'est vieux.
Quelqu'un s'est connecté
sur le réseau
et on a eu un appel anonyme.
Cette personne connaît
le nom de cette femme
mais refuse de le communiquer
par ordinateur ou par téléphone.
Ca a l'air très bizarre.
Vous voulez continuer ?
On attend l'information
par coursier.
Je vous appelle aussitôt.
Broots ?
Je viens de localiser Jarod.
- Où ?
- Agence de recherches de Miami.
Mais on a aussi un signal
à l'intérieur du Centre.
Quelqu'un a contacté
l'agence depuis le Centre.
Quelle information a filtré ?
On n'en est pas sûrs...
Mlle Parker a été prévenue ?
A vous de le faire.
Plutôt me mettre la tête
dans un piège à ours.
Vous faites ça souvent ?
Qu'importe ?
On te tend une perche.
Es-tu assez malin
pour l'attraper ?
Pourquoi un 3e homme ?
On a eu un problème.
C'est pour colmater les fuites.
- Comment vous faites ?
- Avec les codes des magasins.
On risque peu, on gagne gros.
- Et si ça tourne mal ?
- Ca n'arrivera pas.
Faites-moi plaisir.
Et si quelqu'un arrive ?
On est en bleu.
C'est nous, les gentils.
On va pas nous soupçonner !
- Si le type est armé ?
- On le bute.
On fait comme si on interrompait
un braquage en cours.
Comme pour Marvin Kembrook ?
Tu sais ça ?
J'ai aussi lu vos dossiers.
Comment vous avez fait
pour le rapport balistique ?
Quoi ?
On n'a pas trouvé
l'arme du crime.
L'lGS vérifie toujours
les armes des policiers.
Je me suis trompé sur toi.
Allons-y.
Attends un peu !
Vous me demandez de tout risquer.
Je vous demande
si en cas de problème
j'ai une échappatoire ?
Top secret.
Une arme non déclarée.
En cas de pépin, on tire,
on la planque dans ma voiture.
Tu es des nôtres ou pas ?
Ca marche.
Tant mieux.
Je suis content,
mais si tu me doubles,
tu auras une balle dans le coeur.
Papa !
Mon garçon !
Une glace ?
Je ferai un procès à ce trou
jusqu'à son dernier sou.
Ma carte.
J'écoute.
Allons-nous-en.
- Broots, vous connaissez ?
- Prenez un message.
ll a localisé la cible !
Son rire...
sa façon de touiller le café...
Maman !
C'est Susan Granger,
l'enveloppe est là.
J'arrive.
Je dois lui remettre ça
personnellement.
ll m'a tenue à l'écart
assez longtemps.
ll veut savoir la vérité.
ll ne peut pas, vous le savez.
C'est à cause de son coeur...
Quoi ?
Si on est si près du but.
Jarod savait
que s'il envoyait cette photo,
on le retrouverait.
ll est prêt à tout risquer
pour une identité,
pour une vie.
Je compte là-dessus.
C'est à vous de l'ouvrir.
Je suis nerveux.
On ne découvre pas qui on est
chaque jour.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Où est-il ?
Je ne le répéterai pas.
Sam, il monte sur le toit !
Je te tirerai dans le dos !
Sam, attrapez-le !
C'est vous qui avez envoyé ça ?
J'étais avec vous.
Si près...
et pourtant si loin.
lci M. Starr. Pourriez-vous
me rendre un service ?
On a 15 mn
avant l'arrivée du fourgon.
Tu as le code ?
Je vais couper le courant
et les caméras.
Frankie prendra les bijoux
dans le bureau du directeur.
Moi, je surveille l'entrée.
- Et si le vigile est en avance ?
- lmpossible.
- Et si tu te trompes ?
- lls sont morts.
L'heure tourne, messieurs !
Allons-y. Ca va, Frank ?
J'ai trouvé
le bureau du directeur.
Pièces, bagues et chaînes.
Evite les babioles.
Au boulot.
- Tu fais quoi ?
- Je me demandais
ce qu'avait éprouvé
Marvin Kembrook en mourant.
On verra ça plus tard, d'accord ?
ll répond à une alarme.
Le danger fait battre son coeur.
ll a peur...
à juste titre.
ll vient de retrouver sa vie,
de comprendre qui il est,
de redécouvrir sa famille.
ll est soulagé de trouver
deux policiers sur place,
des gentils.
Son soulagement
a été bref, hein ?
Je vous arrête pour le meurtre
de Marvin Kembrook.
Je veux pas être arrêté.
Vous irez en prison,
ainsi que Meyers.
Pose ton arme, Starr.
Ca va pas ?
Désolé, Jarod.
J'irai pas en prison,
j'ai trop de bouches à nourrir.
Mon Dieu !
Appelle, Frank.
- Je leur dis quoi ?
- La vérité.
Un flic est mort
en voulant éviter un casse.
On a vu quelqu'un
sortir en courant.
Frank et moi, on est entrés,
il n'y avait qu'un cadavre.
Un cadavre ?
Starr. Apparemment,
il est arrivé le premier.
On est ressortis,
mais le tireur avait disparu.
C'est ce qui s'est passé ?
Meyers,
c'est ce qui s'est passé ?
Oui, ça s'est passé comme ça.
On y va ?
Que le labo examine la balle.
Tout de suite.
Vous voulez
revoir votre version ?
Le corps était là.
Je le jure, je l'ai vu.
Les clés.
lnspectons
le coffre de votre voiture.
En route !
Accrochez-vous aux branches !
Je suis en règle !
Je vous arrête pour le meurtre
de Marvin Kembrook.
Vous pouvez garder le silence,
tout ce que vous direz
pourra être retenu contre vous.
Vous avez droit à un avocat...
Un policier accusé de meurtre
Marvin Kembrook innocenté
Vous auriez pu tuer Jarod.
Pourquoi avoir changé d'avis ?
Je l'ai raté, Sydney,
ni plus ni moins.
A 11 ans, je vous ai dit
que je n'abandonnerai jamais.
Jamais.
Je sais, Jarod.
Mlle Parker non plus.
- Au revoir.
- Attends.
Dis-moi une chose.
Que signifient les nombres ?
1 0 : 1 9.
C'est ce que je suis, Sydney.
C'est ce que vous avez fait
de moi.
10 : 19 Personne disparue
Où va-t-il aller, maintenant ?
Vers le sud.
Qu'est-ce qui vous fait
dire ça ?
L'instinct.
Le proviseur n'a pas pu venir.
ll est débordé.
S'occuper de la cantine
doit être un travail épuisant.
C'était la classe de M. Jarod.
C'était le meilleur
des remplaçants.
Les élèves assistaient
aux cours par plaisir.
ll faisait
des expériences géniales.
Je vois ça.
On a même étudié la résistance
des insectes aux virus.
Selon lui, seuls les cafards
survivraient à un holocauste,
ainsi qu'une certaine Parker.
Ca n'est pas au programme
de biologie.
Jarod connaissait la musique !
C'est un véritable
homme-orchestre.
Et en plus,
il ne nous notait pas.
ll faisait ses expériences,
on rassemblait les données.
Filez chez vous, maintenant.
Verse une goutte
pour le prochain indice
Tu viens d'attraper la grippe
Carlos !
Reviens ici !
Ne bouge pas.
Arrête !
- Où est ton père ?
- Au fond du couloir.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Vous allez vous en tirer.
Les symptômes du père sont :
perte de poids,
fièvre, sueur, toux,
ganglions enflés...
Tuberculose mycobactérienne.
Ca en a l'air.
C'est rare de nos jours.
Une fois hospitalisé, ça ira.
Comment va le petit ?
C'est trop tôt pour savoir.
Mais mieux que vous
quand Garber découvrira
ce que vous avez fait.
Violer la procédure de quarantaine
était une sottise !
Je sais
que ça ne se fait pas,
mais la tuberculose
est un cas de niveau 2,
la quarantaine sur place
n'est pas nécessaire.
Un conseil amical :
si vous tenez à votre peau,
traitez chaque cas
comme un niveau 4.
Que le petit ait été exposé
ou pas, qu'importe ?
ll est protégé.
Et il peut rester avec son père.
ll en avait besoin.
Florence Nightingale
est parmi nous !
Vous allez adorer !
Four dans la cuisine,
eau chaude et froide...
170 par mois, plus les charges.
170 ?
D'accord, 150.
Et je paie l'eau.
Venez dans le bureau.
- On va signer.
- ll y a des cafards ?
Bien sûr que non !
Cet endroit
est le paradis de la bohème,
- pas un taudis.
- Pas de cafards ?
Bon sang !
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Un cauchemar sans fin
pour boyaux de chat !
C'est aussi le pire choix
de locataire
de toute ma vie !
ll y a un autre immeuble
à deux rues d'ici.
Ca sera plus calme.
Je le prends.
C'est bien mieux
qu'où j'étais avant.
On dirait la grippe.
ll fait froid à Portland
en cette saison.
Gardez-le, il est propre.
Soit, je suis partie sans vous !
Ne me dites pas
que vous êtes jaloux.
Perplexe.
Je pensais
qu'on travaillait ensemble.
Moi aussi,
avant de découvrir
vos annonces dans tout le pays
pour tenter de contacter Jarod.
Je n'aime pas les secrets.
ll ignorait mes e-mails.
J'ai essayé autre chose.
Mais je vous aurais avertie
s'il m'avait contacté.
J'ai la fièvre,
mais pas au point d'avaler ça.
Quoi ?
ll est au labo.
Qui ça ?
M. Raines.
ll n'y va plus depuis 10 ans.
ll y est en ce moment
et il vous cherche.
Bonne chance.
L'Empire State Building !
Qui aurait cru
qu'un enfant de 4 ans pourrait
en faire une réplique en 2 h ?
Jarod était génial
en arrivant ici.
ll a été génial
le jour de son évasion.
La question est...
où est-il ?
Jarod est très difficile
à attraper.
On a besoin de lui, Sydney.
Je sais.
Vous permettez ?
J'ai la grippe, M. Raines.
Je suis mourant.
Gardez-la.
Ramenez Jarod à sa place
ou je trouverai quelqu'un
qui le fera.
C'est bien clair ?
Mon père veut que je m'en charge.
Contrairement
à tout le monde ici,
je n'ai pas peur de votre père.
Je n'ai pas à avoir peur.
Notre travail est d'éviter
la propagation des virus.
J'ai vu les dégâts
qu'ils peuvent causer
et il vaut mieux être prudent.
Mais vous avez bien agi
pour Briggs et son fils.
J'étais à côté de la plaque.
Ce n'est rien.
Vos références sont excellentes.
Un poste
dans un institut de Londres,
un doctorat de virologie.
Où avez-vous passé
votre doctorat ?
Au lycée Greely, à Portland.
La porte sous pression
évite les fuites.
La technique
a été développée ici.
Votre dossier indique que vous
êtes vacciné contre le charbon.
J'ai travaillé dans le Golfe.
A Johannesburg, j'ai été vacciné
contre le syndrome de Pekowsky.
- Quel scénario effrayant !
- En effet.
Voir quelqu'un souffrir
ne laisse pas indifférent.
J'espère pouvoir être utile ici.
Jarod, voici Jeff Baytos,
spécialiste en décontamination.
Enchanté.
Oubliez la poignée de main.
M. Baytos a tendance à être
trop prudent.
lci, c'est impossible.
Un geste de trop
en touchant la chair
et c'est le sous-marin
pendant 10 000 ans.
Vous appelez la morgue
''le sous-marin'' ?
Comment disiez-vous à Londres ?
Tchernobyl.
Aujourd'hui,
on s'occupe d'un niveau 3.
Un cas de fièvre
de la Vallée du Rift.
Prêt à affronter
l'ennemi invisible ?
Absolument.
Vous êtes des nôtres,
M. Baytos ?
Je me limite maintenant
au niveau 2.
Longue vie et prospérité.
ll a vu un homme mourir
du virus Ebola.
Depuis, il ne veut plus
dépasser le niveau 2.
Mais c'est le meilleur
en matière de décontamination.
Mystérieuse disparition
du chercheur Jon Florence
C'est agréable
d'avoir de la visite.
Nos amis ne savent pas quoi dire
et ne viennent pas.
Vous avez connu Jon
en Afrique du Sud ?
Non,
mais j'en ai entendu parler.
On travaillait tous les deux
dans le village de Mutaba.
ll adorait ce poste.
C'était le premier à arriver
et le dernier à partir.
ll restait dans des endroits
où il n'y avait aucun espoir,
aucune chance
de changer les choses.
Tenir la main d'un mourant,
l'accompagner,
ça change les choses.
Je travaille avec Garber pour
finir le travail de votre mari.
C'est bien.
Jon admirait walter.
Les voilà
au banquet de l'OMS.
Et ta sieste ?
J'ai cru entendre papa.
Non, c'est simplement un ami.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Va te reposer.
Ca a été très dur pour elle.
ll a disparu
juste avant son anniversaire.
Comment expliquer ça à Cindy ?
Comment expliquer
quoi que ce soit ?
Je sais qu'il ne reviendra pas.
J'ai accepté ça.
C'est seulement que...
je voudrais savoir que faire.
Et comment m'y prendre.
Est-il mort, est-il vivant ?
C'est une très jolie bague.
Jon a dessiné nos alliances.
Je sais que c'est bébête,
mais il voulait que ce soit
les seules à être identiques.
C'est ce que Jon portait
pour travailler sur le terrain.
ll ne s'en lassait pas.
Prenez-la.
- Je ne peux pas accepter.
- ll aurait voulu
la donner à quelqu'un
d'aussi généreux que lui.
Ca me va comme un gant.
Est-ce que vous pourriez
m'aider ?
Oui, quel est le problème ?
ll est écrit que
ceci est un motel pour cafards.
C'est comme
un Hôtel California
pour nos amis à six pattes.
lls ont beau payer la note,
ils ne peuvent pas partir.
Un piège ?
En quelque sorte.
C'est parfait.
J'en prends cent.
Pas de problème.
Je vous étrangle
si vous n'arrêtez pas !
A table !
Vous êtes un homme mort, Hansel !
A table !
J'ai payé mon loyer,
vous ne m'expulserez pas.
Je m'appelle Jarod,
je suis votre voisin.
Je voulais vous dire
que votre musique m'intriguait.
Ca marche pas avec moi !
J'aimerais vous rencontrer
et vous poser une question.
Vous me flanquez à la porte ?
Je n'y compte pas et vous êtes
le bienvenu chez moi.
Ca change,
d'avoir un public chaleureux.
Je m'appelle Ben Hansel.
J'ai besoin de votre aide.
Moi aussi.
Vous jouez d'un instrument ?
ll m'arrive
de diriger un orchestre.
Alors, qu'est-ce que vous pensez
de ça ?
Tous des nains
en matière de culture !
C'est très intéressant.
Le concerto pour violoncelle
en ut majeur de Haydn.
Adapté pour la trompette.
Je le réécris pour glockenspiel.
Un artiste doit avoir
plusieurs cordes à son arc.
- Vous êtes musicien depuis...
- 15 ans.
C'est long.
Mais ça en vaudra la peine
quand le Philharmonique appellera.
Je leur envoyé une cassette
il y a une semaine.
Vous aviez une question ?
J'essaie en vain d'attirer
des cafards. Vous en avez ?
Des cafards ?
J'arrive pas à m'en défaire.
Une fois, j'ai renversé
une boîte de céréales
derrière le frigo
et depuis, chaque nuit,
ils partent en chasse.
Des céréales ?
C'est ''grotesquement délicieux''.
Trouvez-vous mon interprétation
du premier mouvement subtile ?
La subtilité est une vertu.
Un voisin qui a des lettres !
Merci, Jarod.
Criez à travers le mur
quand vous voulez.
Merci du tuyau.
Tu seras très bien ici.
Votre héritage.
Amicalement, J.
Eau polluée : 66 morts
Une explosion chimique
fait 124 morts
En quelques secondes,
le virus envahit les cellules.
Pour un virus de niveau 4,
les résultats sont terribles.
L'épidémie du village de Mutaba.
Les sujets commencent à tousser
4 h après l'explosion.
L'hémorragie interne
commence au bout de 12 h
et après 36 h,
le sujet a perdu tout son sang.
On peut ignorer l'hôtesse
montrant
comment attacher sa ceinture,
mais pour le virus Mutaba,
le taux de mortalité
est de 90%.
Avec un virus
en suspension dans l'air,
il suffit d'une piqûre d'épingle
dans un gant
pour se retrouver dans le sas,
avant de finir
dans le sous-marin.
Lumière.
Merci pour l'exposé, Dr Reilly.
Vous avez exagéré.
Jon Florence et vous
avez trouvé un vaccin.
On a eu de la chance.
Pour le virus Ebola ou Mutaba,
il faut rester prudent.
Désolé pour le Dr Florence.
ll doit vous manquer.
Beaucoup.
ll semblait tenir à sa famille.
Pas du genre à s'envoler.
ll était bon.
Vous devriez savoir
que d'horribles choses grouillent
sous des apparences saines.
Jon m'avait confié
que tout n'était pas rose
à la maison.
ll ne s'étendait pas,
mais préférait sûrement
faire des heures sup
que rentrer chez lui.
C'est un virus de niveau 4.
Soyons prudents.
Début de la phase de dissection.
Nous sommes 72 h après
un décès dû au virus Mutaba,
sujet 247.
Bon Dieu ! Décontamination !
Allez, vite !
Douche de décontamination !
Restez calme.
Ca va aller.
Ca ne marche pas !
Laissez-moi faire.
Enlevez le gant.
Vite !
Pas d'égratignure. Le sang
devait venir du prélèvement.
Bravo à tous.
Tout s'est bien déroulé.
On visionnera la cassette
de sécurité demain.
Vous avez bien joué
le jeu de la simulation.
Je suis très entraîné.
Qui a changé
le code d'accès du sas ?
Moins de gens le connaissent,
moins il y a de risques.
Personne
ne doit approcher du sas.
- A vos risques et périls.
- Non, aux siens !
Garber est le seul à avoir
le code d'accès du sas ?
Et du sous-marin.
Comment va ma filleule, Jon ?
Elle va avoir 6 ans
et croit en avoir 16.
- Viens à son anniversaire.
- Naturellement !
J'ai fait l'autopsie du singe.
Regarde le foie.
Ca alors !
Le virus a subi une mutation.
On finira ça lundi
à la première heure.
Pardonnez-moi, mon père,
car j'ai péché.
Ca fait...
mon Dieu...
33 ans
que je ne me suis pas confessé.
J'ai trahi un ami.
Vous devez chercher son pardon.
ll m'a chassé de sa mémoire.
Autre chose vous perturbe.
Avez-vous prié le Seigneur
pour qu'll vous pardonne ?
Même Lui ne peut me pardonner
pour ce que j'ai fait.
Regarde le foie.
Ca alors !
Le virus a subi une mutation.
On dirait le Cahuenga, en pire.
C'est un virus de niveau 5.
Bon sang,
qu'est-ce que tu as fait ?
J'ai travaillé dessus,
- génétiquement.
- Tu t'es pris pour Dieu.
On doit oublier ce projet.
Je vais le détruire.
- Tu ne peux pas.
- Mais si !
- Pas question !
- Mon arrivée d'air !
Walter... Tu m'as tué !
Vite,
à la douche de décontamination.
Le labo est plein de virus.
Reste calme, pas de panique.
Manque de pression !
Rentre dans le sas,
je te retrouve là-bas.
Bonjour, Jon.
Je craignais de vous trouver ici.
Vous me rendez dingue !
Silence !
lnterprétation intéressante.
Vous êtes nul !
Vous êtes un voisin poli,
mais les nains de la culture
ont raison.
Je suis mauvais.
C'est long,
de maîtriser la musique.
Toute une vie
ne me suffirait pas.
Ma musique tue les plantes.
Je suis ce qu'était Salieri
à Mozart.
Je maudis Dieu de m'avoir donné
des capacités médiocres.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Des bricoles, des babioles,
des exercices inutiles.
C'est vous qui avez fait ça ?
C'est ravissant, Ben.
Merci du compliment, Jarod.
Mais ça n'est pas de l'art.
L'art, c'est très varié.
Certains choisissent
un pinceau, un archet,
un stylo et certains...
choisissent le verre.
Comment ?
Peut-être que vous créez
au travers de ces oeuvres
plutôt que de ça.
Vous l'avez dit.
Un artiste doit avoir
plusieurs cordes à son arc.
J'ai peur,
je ne peux pas faire ça.
ll le faut, Jarod.
ll y a de la fumée,
les gens hurlent.
lls brûlent, Sydney !
Arrêtez l'incendie !
Arrêtez ça !
Non, laissez-moi tranquille !
Ne t'inquiète pas, Jarod.
C'est fini, ça va.
Je veux mon papa.
Ca s'arrête
avec le mot de passe.
Tu n'as pas utilisé ce mot.
J'ai dit
que je voulais mon papa.
Laissez-moi faire.
Souviens-toi,
quand tu fais une simulation,
que tu as peur
et que tu veux arrêter,
dis ''refuge''.
D'accord ?
Pour trouver Refuge, allez...
ll m'a contacté.
Pas de secrets.
Pourquoi ce changement soudain ?
Depuis peu, je vois les choses
sous un autre angle.
ll vaut peut-être mieux
que vous l'attrapiez.
Dr Hoffman !
Vous avez une minute ?
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Que dites-vous de ça ?
Liquéfaction des organes,
sécrétions sanguines
par les pores, chute de cheveux.
Une version avancée du Mutaba ?
C'est ce que je croyais
avant de découvrir ça...
Je n'ai jamais vu ça.
Vous avez vérifié ?
Avec chaque échantillon
répertorié.
ll y en a 3 000.
Au bout de 800,
c'était fastidieux.
C'est pire
que tous les niveaux 4.
C'est un niveau 5.
On a un niveau 5 ?
J'ai prélevé ça
sur un corps dans le sous-marin.
Comment vous êtes entré ?
Seul Garber...
a le code.
Toutes les recherches
sont sanctionnées par l'Etat ?
Quel projet ne l'est pas ?
C'est une rumeur,
mais la source est fiable.
Garber faisait des recherches,
je ne sais pas lesquelles.
Jon Florence
vous a dit autre chose ?
Comment savez-vous
que c'est lui ?
Hormis Garber, c'était le seul
à savoir ce qui se passait.
Qu'a-t-il dit d'autre ?
Que Garber travaillait
sur des mutations de niveau 5.
ll a dit
que ça avait bien commencé,
mais que ça tournait mal.
Jon a dit :
''Dieu ne me pardonnerait pas
de laisser faire ça.''
Malheureusement
pour Jon Florence,
il n'a pas pu arrêter le projet.
Mon Dieu !
Ca alors !
Le virus a subi une mutation.
On finira ça lundi
à la première heure.
Entre le bouton,
l'embout et l'eau du robinet,
il y a assez de germes
pour tuer un cafard.
Dr Reilly !
Vous avez sûrement raison.
Je m'occupe de germes,
mais je ne crois pas
pouvoir vivre dans une bulle.
Même équipée
d'une douche de décontamination ?
Excellente prestation, Jeff.
Je ne comprends pas.
Je dois passer la vidéo
pour voir votre visage ?
Je n'arrive pas à dormir.
Je sais ce que c'est.
Un homme m'a supplié de l'aider,
de lui permettre de revoir
sa femme et sa fille...
et je ne l'ai pas fait.
Je sais
que Jon Florence a été contaminé.
que vous avez trafiqué la vidéo
avec Garber,
mais je ne comprends pas pourquoi.
Parce que c'était ma faute.
J'étais resté tard
avec Jon et Garber.
J'ai vu Jon entrer dans le sas...
ll avait l'air terrifié.
La douche de décontamination
manquait de pression
et je suis chargé de veiller
à ce que ça n'arrive pas.
Garber m'a accusé
de la contamination de Jon.
Je n'ai jamais vu un virus
faire ce que ça lui a fait
et aussi vite.
Voilà pourquoi
vous restez au niveau 2.
Jon m'a supplié d'appeler
sa femme et sa fille.
Et Garber m'a dit de me taire,
sinon les autorités
fermeraient le laboratoire
et mon erreur coûterait la vie
à d'autres personnes.
Jon Florence n'est pas mort
à cause de vous ou de la douche.
ll est mort parce que
walter Garber l'a tué.
Boucherie Bob ?
Je voudrais
une douzaine de foies de porc.
Un sourire !
Bonjour à tous.
Cette leçon nous entraîne
dans le monde fascinant
des cafards.
walter,
Jarod à l'appareil.
J'ai fait une découverte
très intéressante.
- De quoi s'agit-il ?
- ll est encore tôt,
mais j'ai peut-être
un vaccin contre le Mutaba.
Rendez-vous au labo
dans une heure.
Parfait.
De quoi s'agit-il ?
D'où vient le prélèvement ?
De ce foie.
C'est un virus
en suspension dans l'air !
walter, votre arrivée d'air.
Donnez l'alarme ! Aidez-moi !
La douche manque de pression !
Vous feriez mieux
d'aller dans le sas.
Où sont-ils tous ?
Et les médecins ?
Baytos !
ll n'y a personne ici.
lls sont partis.
Vous m'avez tué, Jarod !
Du calme. Je vous ai dit
que j'avais fait une découverte.
Un croisement entre le Cahuenga
et la fièvre de la Vallée du Rift.
Un anti-virus
qui vous immunisera.
Donnez-le-moi.
lmpossible.
Aidez-moi !
Comme vous avez aidé
Jon Florence ?
En l'exposant à un niveau 5
sans traitement ?
Vous êtes qui ?
En tous cas, je ne suis pas
Florence Nightingale.
Vous non plus.
Quand Jon Florence
a-t-il commencé à présenter
des symptômes ?
Quand a commencé
l'hémorragie interne ?
Quand le tissu cérébral
a-t-il commencé à couler ?
Quand ses organes ont-ils
commencé à se liquéfier ? Quand ?
- Donnez-moi la seringue.
- Pourquoi ?
Jon Florence n'a pas eu
cette chance. Pourquoi vous ?
C'était un accident.
ll savait qu'il allait mourir
et voulait revoir sa famille,
pour dire adieu
à sa femme et sa fille.
Mais vous lui avez refusé ça,
parce qu'on aurait su
que vous jouiez à Dieu
avec ces expériences virales.
Vous avez pris la vie
de Jon Florence
et gâché celle de sa famille.
Ca n'est pas un accident.
D'accord, je l'ai tué.
Les recherches
étaient très importantes.
Donnez-moi le vaccin !
D'accord, walter.
Mais je vous préviens,
c'est de l'eau sucrée.
Je ne sais pas faire de vaccin.
Je ne suis pas vraiment virologue.
A vrai dire, cet endroit
me fiche la trouille !
On a beau payer la note,
on ne peut pas partir !
Ne me laissez pas !
Revenez, Jarod !
Je vous en prie,
ne me laissez pas ici !
Vous lui direz
qu'il n'est pas contaminé ?
Si vous vous en chargiez ?
Dans 48 h.
Quand la police aura vu ça.
Mon Dieu, aidez-moi !
C'est quoi, cette odeur ?
Je ne sens rien.
Fouillez cette pièce.
Bonjour à tous.
Cette leçon nous entraîne dans
le monde fascinant des cafards.
ll est parti.
ll me le paiera.
Ceci est
un motel à cafards.
Quand les hormones de cafard
- c'est-à-dire le truc mouillé
dans lequel vous avez marché -
se mêlent au contenu de la boîte,
cela donne une matière
plus collante que la résine.
Bienvenue
dans ce motel à cafards géant.
Salaud !
Bon séjour.
Le cours est terminé.
Je suis collé.
Chivas, un seul glaçon.
Habile façon de me contacter !
Personne au Centre
n'aurait compris.
ll fallait que je te voie.
Mlle Parker
a mordu à l'hameçon ?
Probablement.
J'ai une chose à te demander.
Vous n'êtes pas en position
de demander.
Pas même ton pardon ?
Pour t'avoir gardé au Centre.
Pour tous ces mensonges.
C'est toi qui m'as envoyé ça ?
Non.
Alors, c'est Parker
qui a signé pour toi.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Des souvenirs.
Des comptes que je dois régler
avec moi-même...
avec Dieu.
Et avec toi.
Trop tard.
Je viens faire la paix.
D'accord.
Vous voulez mon pardon ?
Que sont devenus mes parents ?
Je ne peux pas.
J'ignore la vérité.
Alors, le Centre
ne me récupérera jamais.
Et je ne peux pas
vous pardonner.
Ni à moi, d'ailleurs.
M. Hansel,
ici le Philharmonique de Chicago.
On a reçu votre superbe
sculpture sur verre.
On aimerait fixer
un rendez-vous avec votre agent.
Que diriez-vous de mercredi...
Merci...
pour tout.
Qu'allez-vous faire ?
Changer de métier.
Vous avez des cafards ?
- Où est-il ?
- Trouvez-le !
Pas de bisou pour le Père Noël,
cette année.
Qu'est-ce que vous avez vu ?
Je ne suis qu'un lutin.
J'obéis.
Je suis joyeux.
Et je l'ai pas vu
depuis hier soir.
Ah oui ?
- Vous l'enlevez quand ?
- Bientôt, le fourgon arrive.
Le traîneau, plutôt.
On en a un vivant.
Un vivant ?
Je plaisante.
Le chasse-neige
a dû le recouvrir.
- C'est le Père Noël ?
- Oui, il a un chapeau rouge.
Quelqu'un a une pelle ?
J'ai du papier cadeau.
Merci, Gus.
Dr Drake...
Les cadeaux du maire.
- Comme l'an passé ?
- A l'odeur, oui.
C'est la saison, Fugimora.
Distribuez-les.
On verra qui y survit.
Bien, madame.
Comment est le nouveau ?
Mieux que le Père Noël.
Vous buvez en service ?
On l'a trouvé sur place.
Dr Jarod Marley,
le Dr Lisabeth Drake,
notre légiste en chef.
Vous avez fini ?
Oui.
lnspecteur Guerra.
Pile à l'heure !
On y va ?
La victime n'est pas
Kris Kringle,
mais Theodore Hargrove,
A vous, docteur.
ll est mort principalement
d'une attaque.
Ce n'était pas de froid ?
Je le pensais aussi,
mais l'examen a révélé la vérité.
C'est plausible.
ll s'était tapé
une sacrée lambada.
J'ignore qui est Lambada,
mais oui.
La pâleur vient du froid
mais les muscles des jambes
indiquent une activité intense.
- Et l'heure du décès ?
- lmpossible.
ll fait trop froid.
C'est là que ceci intervient.
Le lait de poule était dur,
mais pas entièrement gelé,
grâce à la quantité d'alcool.
Appétissant...
Le lait est caillé.
J'ai comparé
les bactéries du verre
à celles trouvées dans la neige
et j'en déduis
que M. Hargrove
a succombé à son attaque
entre 1 h45 et 2h du matin.
Je dirais 1 h48 et des poussières.
En guise d'autopsie,
j'ai un lait de poule.
Les représentants du maire
sont là.
lls sont en avance !
On a fini.
Stress professionnel ?
Vous connaissez pas le maire.
lls offrent des cadeaux qui tuent.
Sérieusement, ils tuent.
Encore !
Pour moi ?
Vous n'avez jamais reçu
de cadeau de Noël ?
Pas depuis très longtemps.
Merci.
- Un gâteau aux cerises confites.
- C'est un cake.
Un cake avec des fruits ?
Merci. Ca doit être délicieux.
- On lui dit ?
- ll le découvrira lui-même.
Jarod est retourné
dans sa chambre.
Comme toujours, mon congé
de Noël commence demain.
Je serai à Mount Pleasant.
C'est la saison de Noël,
mais le Centre protège Jarod
des pièges de la culture populaire.
Jarod, je pars une semaine.
Je te dis au revoir.
Vous partez toujours
quand il fait froid.
Pour le travail, c'est tout.
Ne dis rien.
Je t'ai apporté...
un cadeau.
Un cadeau ?
De la neige ?
Ne dis à personne
que je t'ai donné ça.
Emmenez-moi dehors
voir la vraie neige.
- Je ne peux pas.
- Je veux la voir.
Contente-toi de cette neige
et je te reverrai bientôt.
Deux gosses ont trouvé
une nana dans la neige.
C'est criminel.
Clocharde.
Cherchez les piqûres.
A priori, c'est une O.D.
Je me demande qui c'est.
On le saura jamais. P.F.P.
On l'emballe.
La prochaine fois,
me faites pas attendre.
P.F.P. ?
Petite fille perdue.
Ni témoins ni papiers.
Sa famille doit être malade
d'inquiétude.
C'est tragique.
Sûrement une fugueuse.
C'est fréquent.
Nulle part où aller,
elle devient un fait divers
comme les autres.
Ca va ?
Non.
Fascinant, non ?
Un seul jumeau est branché,
mais les 2 sentent le choc.
Je ne veux pas le savoir.
Les nettoyeurs sont rentrés.
- Du nouveau ?
- La dernière vie de Jarod.
C'est vous, le psy.
Cherchez leur sens.
Jarod veut me dire quelque chose.
Jolie carte de voeux.
Mais soyez réaliste :
il ne rentrera pas pour les fêtes.
Peut-être pas,
mais il me contactera.
ll est obligé.
C'est Noël.
Je m'inquiète pour lui,
dehors en cette saison.
Du calme.
ll doit être au chaud en train
de découvrir les contes de Noël.
Héros sans-abri laissé pour mort
la veille de Noël
Les enfants du foyer
pleurent ''George Noël''
Vous en voulez ?
C'est du cake.
J'en suis pas là.
- Vous écrivez un livre ?
- Pas tout à fait.
ll vous manque ?
- Qui ?
- George.
George Noël.
- Vous le connaissiez ?
- C'est comme si.
George était ma seule famille.
ll était la seule famille
de beaucoup de gens.
- Les enfants le regrettent ?
- Des orphelins, des fugueurs...
lls connaissaient le vrai George.
On le traitait de clochard
parce qu'il était SDF
et faisait la manche.
Mais avec cet argent,
il leur offrait des cadeaux
et un bon repas chaque année.
ll se déguisait en Père Noël
et leur lisait des contes.
D'où son surnom ''George Noël''.
De son vivant, ils avaient tous
une famille au moins un jour.
Et Noël veut rien dire,
sans famille.
Je commence à m'en rendre compte.
Vous voilà, Jarod.
Merci pour tout
ce que vous avez fait.
Sans George, ce n'est pas pareil.
Je suis heureux d'aider.
Pour un homme heureux,
vous semblez perplexe.
Je le suis.
Avez-vous lu ça ?
La Veille de Noël ?
C'est un classique.
C'est très bien,
mais une chose m'échappe.
Pour faire un cadeau à tous
les enfants du monde, le Père Noël
devrait visiter
Son renne devrait faire
du 1120 km/s.
ll aurait 0,001 seconde
pour se garer,
descendre les cadeaux
et manger les biscuits.
Pour un homme âgé,
c'est un exploit.
Le Père Noël a ses secrets.
C'est invraisemblable.
Qui peut y croire ?
C'est Noël, Jarod.
Tout est possible.
Angel, ils font du pop-corn.
Tu veux les aider ?
Tu veux voir le Père Noël ?
C'est pas lui.
Ca ne va pas ?
George Noël va revenir ?
Non, il ne reviendra pas.
Pourquoi ?
George Noël est mort.
Tu sais ce que ça signifie ?
On ne le verra plus jamais.
C'est vrai, mais pas tout à fait.
Je peux te demander...
pourquoi tu aimais George ?
ll était gentil.
ll veillait à ce que
chaque enfant ait un cadeau.
ll y avait quelque chose en lui
qui te rendait heureuse.
Tant que tu ressentiras ça,
George sera là.
Chaque fois qu'à Noël,
je penserai à lui, il sera là ?
Chaque fois.
Je peux vous aider ?
A maman quej'aime
Joyeux Noël - M.P. 1969
Vous avez fait 137 analyses.
Du nouveau sur P.F.P. ?
Ce n'est pas son nom.
Je ne pensais pas à mal.
Elle doit avoir un nom.
Sa famille doit savoir.
Surtout en ce moment.
Vous n'abandonnerez pas.
Voici d'autres tubes de Noël,
à écouter au chaud
avec l'être cher.
Bonnes fêtes !
C'est moi. J'organise une soirée
au club pour les fêtes.
Ce serait triste,
sans ma fille préférée.
- Je viendrai.
- Le 24 décembre à 19h.
Les Européens seront là.
Sois ponctuelle.
Bien sûr, papa. Joyeux...
Une balle dans les branchies ?
Pas un patient.
Le déjeuner.
Vous êtes jeune
pour vous empoisonner.
Le fugu n'est poison
que non-préparé.
Ses toxines sont 500 fois
plus fortes que le cyanure.
Mais bien cuisiné,
c'est à se damner.
Au dîner de Noël ici,
mon fugu est une tradition.
Les gars de la morgue adorent,
surtout avec des canneberges.
Je reste au cake.
Et du calme.
Mon oncle était chef à Tokyo.
''Etait'' ?
ll est retraité.
Heureux de l'apprendre.
Vous pouvez m'aider ?
- Vous avez renversé la tasse ?
- Non, la cafetière.
ll y a un duplicata.
Montrez-moi où sont les archives.
SAMU alerté - Coupable en fuite
Mort sur le coup
Attendez quelques secondes.
J'ai déjà envoyé l'ambulance.
Les toilettes bouchées,
ça ne nous concerne pas.
Raccrochez et appelez un plombier.
ll faut le faire vomir.
Votre doigt fera l'affaire.
- Ca marche pas !
- Votre fils va s'en tirer,
si vous m'écoutez bien.
Tirez-lui la tête en arrière.
Faites-le respirer.
Faites pression sur sa poitrine.
Je compte jusqu'à 5.
ll respire !
Mon fils respire !
C'est fantastique.
L'ambulance est là.
Ce n'était pas si difficile.
Joyeux Noël.
lci le SAMU.
lci Harry. J'appelle
de l'angle Lawson et Hill.
Mon ami...
Mon ami George...
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- On l'a renversé !
Envoyez quelqu'un.
Lawson et Hill,
devant le foyer pour enfants.
ll y a d'autres blessés ?
Non. On l'a renversé.
Le chauffeur a filé.
C'est arrivé ici ?
Je l'ai trouvé ici.
On l'a laissé crever là.
''On'' ?
J'en sais rien. C'est le bruit
qui m'a réveillé. J'ai rien vu.
Je suis désolé.
Je suis resté auprès de lui
jusqu'à l'arrivée du légiste.
Le légiste ?
Pas la police ?
Changement de consigne.
ll me tenait la main.
On s'est dit au revoir.
ll n'est pas mort sur le coup ?
Non, c'est un battant.
Le légiste a essayé de le sauver
en lui faisant une piqûre,
mais en vain.
J'ignorais que les légistes
avaient des trousses.
Moi aussi.
Elle a fait son possible,
mais à l'arrivée des flics,
George était mort.
Elle...
Elle était seule ?
Les cheveux roux ?
Oui. Comment vous le savez ?
Vous avez gardé la P.F.P. ?
J'ai besoin de place.
- J'ai trouvé des fractures...
- Oubliez.
On a fait notre devoir.
Faites les papiers
et expédiez-la.
Je comprends.
Vous bossez pour le réveillon.
Mais l'an dernier,
c'était si calme
qu'on a ouvert une bouteille.
Je ne serai pas là
pour trinquer.
On ne sait jamais.
Noël, ça rapproche les gens.
Notre inconnue
s'appelait Gabrielle.
Gabrielle Ryan.
Elle est de Nashton
et allait sur ses 18 ans.
Comment vous avez fait ?
Fractures sur la malléole tibiale.
Chevilles usées.
Ca et la corne
sur la paume de la main.
Elle faisait
des barres parallèles.
Vous allez prévenir sa famille ?
Comptez sur moi.
Beau boulot.
A la prochaine.
Voyez les choses en face.
Noël approche.
ll n'appellera pas.
Vous vous apprêtez
à partir en congé.
Alors, tenez.
Un cadeau de Noël
de votre part ?
Pas de quoi accrocher le gui.
A l'année prochaine.
Joyeux Noël à vous aussi,
Mlle Parker.
D'après le registre,
vous étiez là à Noël
l'an dernier.
J'étais la nouvelle.
Cette année, c'est votre tour.
Ca ne me dérange pas.
Je n'ai jamais pris de congé.
J'ai des questions
sur les autopsies.
Allez-y.
ll n'y en a eu que deux.
Un SDF laissé pour mort
nommé George Noël
et une femme de 80 ans,
Edwina Morris.
- Ca vous dit quelque chose ?
- La vieille dame.
Un sosie de Mamie walton,
en grosse.
Le SDF,
je n'étais pas sur le coup.
Vous n'étiez pas seule de garde ?
Drake est arrivée
avec le SDF.
Elle a fait l'autopsie.
Le légiste en chef
est venu le soir de Noël
pour faire l'autopsie d'un SDF ?
Avec un karma comme le sien,
elle doit pas être très demandée.
L'autre personne, Edwina Morris,
venait de psychiatrie ?
Non. Juste une très grosse
grand-mère
morte de sa belle mort.
Pourquoi ?
Elle avait du phénotripticol
dans le sang.
Du phénotripticol ?
On utilise ça
pour les patients psychotiques.
A haute dose,
ça provoque une paralysie
où le patient est conscient
mais immobile.
Mort, mais pas mort.
Mon Dieu !
Je n'ai pas autopsié quelqu'un
qui était vivant et conscient !
Non. Pas vous.
C'est impossible.
Quelqu'un s'est trompé
sur les rapports.
Ou les a intervertis.
Volontairement.
Tu es Mlle Parker ?
Je savais pas
qu'il y avait quelqu'un.
Ne dis pas que je suis venue.
Pourquoi tu es venue ?
Ma mère me laisse voir les lapins
quand il y a personne.
J'en veux un,
mais mon père est contre.
On les étudie.
ll y a 3 paires de jumeaux.
lls n'ont jamais été ensemble,
mais bizarrement,
ceux qui sont identiques
se retrouvent.
Une force les réunit.
Tu vois ?
lls sont doux.
Excusez-moi, vous auriez...
Je suis pas du quartier.
Vous ne m'avez pas vue ?
Ca va.
C'est juste une égratignure.
Et vous ?
Ca va.
Je vais vous soigner.
Vous êtes parée.
Nos patients sont morts,
mais on reste médecins.
Sans doute.
Je l'ai toujours.
On peut toujours
avoir besoin de nous.
On ne sait jamais.
Tu n'es pas dans ta chambre ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Une expérience.
La voiture pour Mount Pleasant
est là.
Qu'ils attendent.
Vous reviendrez,
n'est-ce pas, Sydney ?
Je reviens toujours, Jarod.
La voiture pour Mount Pleasant
est là.
La voiture pour Mount Pleasant
est là.
J'arrive tout de suite.
''Urgence cadeaux'' ?
J'ai besoin d'un cadeau.
Dr Fugimora ?
Je déteste annoncer
une mauvaise nouvelle,
mais vous devez
travailler ce soir.
Un terrible accident.
Je vous raconterai.
J'adore les fêtes !
C'est si festif !
Vous ne travaillez pas ?
Si,
mais j'ai un cadeau pour vous.
Pour moi ?
Ouvrez.
Un cake.
ll sent bon.
J'ai voulu en faire un moi-même.
A vous l'honneur.
Non, merci.
C'est bon !
Vous allez passer
les fêtes en famille ?
Ce ne sera pas possible,
cette année.
Ca va ?
Je me sens un peu...
Je vais vous aider.
Mon ventre !
Ce gâteau...
Je me suis donné du mal.
Ca ne peut pas être le...
Quoi ?
Fugimora m'a appris
à préparer le fugu.
Je m'entraînais
en préparant le cake.
J'ai pu en faire tomber
dans la pâte.
- Du fugu ?
- J'en ai peur.
lmbécile !
Vous m'avez empoisonnée.
Je suis désolé.
Appelez le SAMU.
- Je ne peux pas.
- Enfin, Jarod !
Je ne peux pas appeler.
- Vous êtes fou ?
- Non, je suis prudent.
Appeler le SAMU
ne serait pas bon pour moi.
lls verraient
que vous êtes malade
et comprendraient
que je vous ai empoisonnée.
Ca me coûterait ma carrière.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- On a renversé George.
Envoyez quelqu'un.
Lawson et Hill,
devant le foyer pour enfants.
Dépêchez-vous !
- D'autres blessés ?
- Non, le chauffeur a filé.
Vous êtes médecin légiste.
Les morts, c'est votre boulot.
Même quand c'est vous
qui les tuez.
Vous aviez un peu bu,
à Noël l'an passé ?
Mettez-vous à la place de George
quand vous l'avez laissé
dans la neige.
Vous êtes partie
et vous avez entendu par radio
qu'il vivait encore.
ll vous fallait intervenir.
Ca aurait nui à votre carrière.
Vous êtes revenue sur place
avant l'arrivée de la police.
Vous n'aviez rien
dans votre trousse
pour le tuer,
mais de quoi le paralyser.
ll était conscient
de ce qui lui arrivait,
mais pour la police,
il semblait mort.
Ce n'était qu'un sans-abri.
Vous avez pensé :
personne ne le réclamera.
Comme vous dites :
''On emballe.''
Je ne suis pas morte.
Si ça peut vous consoler,
je ne suis pas légiste.
Mais tout le monde le croit,
alors je vais prononcer
votre décès.
On vous achèvera sur le billard,
comme vous avez achevé George.
Joyeux Noël.
Je n'ai jamais autopsié
mon boss.
Allons d'abord déjeuner.
Qui veut du fugu ?
Les effets du phénotripticol
vont s'estomper,
mais elle se réveillera
avec une diarrhée carabinée.
Joyeux Noël, Jarod.
Joyeux Noël.
ll m'a dit de vous donner ça.
Qui ''il'' ?
La vérité sur la mort
de George Noël.
Joyeux Noël. Jarod.
Je suis Timothy Ryan.
Le frère de Gabrielle ?
Je voulais juste...
L'inspecteur a dit que pour
l'identifier, vous vous êtes fendu.
Je regrette
que ça ait été si long.
Et que vous l'appreniez
maintenant.
Moi pas.
On aurait pu passer notre vie
à se demander.
Merci de nous avoir évité
cet enfer.
Papa, bonsoir.
Je me préparais...
Je comprends.
On fera ça l'an prochain.
Joyeux Noël.
ll est prêt.
Je vous admire, Sydney.
ll est ici depuis 30 ans.
Vous n'avez jamais manqué un Noël.
C'est normal.
ll est ma seule famille.
Et votre fils ?
Mon fils ?
Oui, Jarod.
Jarod est venu ?
ll est resté le temps
de laisser un cadeau.
J'ignore ce qu'il lui a dit,
mais quand il lui a donné ça,
je jure que votre frère a souri.
C'était la veille de Noël
et dans le logis,
personne ne bougeait,
pas même les souris.
Les bas étaient accrochés
à la cheminée
en attendant
la venue du Père Noël.
Les enfants au fond de leur lit
rêvaient de sucreries.
Mama et moi nous apprêtions
à dormir une bonne nuit
quand j'entendis un bruit
qui me fit bondir hors du lit,
me précipiter à la fenêtre
et ouvrir les volets à la hâte.
Mes yeux émerveillés virent alors
un traîneau minuscule
et huit petits rennes
ainsi qu'un vieux cocher
si alerte
que je sus immédiatement
que c'était le Père Noël.
ll sifflait, criait,
les appelait par leur nom.
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer et Vixen,
Comet, Cupid, Donner et Blixen.
ll grimpa dans son traîneau,
siffla son attelage
et ils s'envolèrent aussitôt,
mais je l'entendis crier
avant de disparaître :
''Joyeux Noël à tous
et bonne nuit. ''
Vous avez entendu ?
Dans l'autre pièce.
Vous croyez...
Le Père Noël !
Dans l'autre pièce !
Le sapin !
Un cadeau pour moi ?
De qui ?
Fais-moi voir.
Qu'est-ce que ça dit ?
''Les amis font de Noël une fête.
''A Angel. Joyeux Noël.
George Noël.''

Je veux savoir qui je suis.
Je peux tout endurer pour ça.
Je n'abandonnerai jamais.
Ca fait 3 jours, Jarod.
La température dépasse 37,8°.
Tu n'es pas obligé de continuer.
J'y arriverai.
Je veux savoir qui je suis.
Je peux tout endurer pour ça.
D'où ça vient ?
Les nettoyeurs ont trouvé ça
dans un chalet vers Albuquerque.
C'est à Jarod.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
J'ignore l'objectif initial
de la simulation.
- Je vais voir les archives.
- Vous fatiguez pas.
- C'est une diversion.
- Je ne crois pas.
C'est très important pour Jarod.
ll se lance.
ll fait le grand saut de la foi.
Rappelez-vous
ce que vous avez appris.
- Je vais vomir !
- Non, ça va aller.
C'est vous l'expert.
Si on veut !
Vous avez fait combien de sauts ?
En comptant celui-ci ?
Un.
Champions du monde
de saut en parachute
Dur boulot ?
J'ai sous-estimé ma charge.
ll y en a de toutes sortes.
Passez-vous ça.
- C'est quoi ?
- Un remède de cheval.
Pour les pur-sang
qui se froissent un muscle.
Après quelques ménagères,
vous en boirez.
Encore une cliente satisfaite.
Bravo !
Le poste de moniteur est à vous
si vous le voulez toujours.
C'est un plaisir.
Crockett, Tasco a appelé ?
Aucun coup de fil.
Comment va le coucou ?
J'ai réparé la fuite du réservoir,
mais c'est la fin.
Fais-le tenir quelques jours
et je t'en offre un tout neuf.
Votre CV est très impressionnant.
La 82e aéroportée,
les Rangers...
Un peu prestigieux,
pour un futur moniteur.
- Pourquoi nous ?
- Je fuis une organisation secrète.
J'avais besoin d'une planque.
Je ne comprends toujours pas
l'intérêt de cette simulation.
Sydney manque parfois de méthode
dans sa folie.
Nous cherchions
à savoir si l'esprit
pouvait permettre au corps
de se surpasser
sous l'influence
d'un stimulus affectif.
Comme une mère qui soulève
une voiture pour dégager son fils.
Exactement.
Mlle Parker,
un cadeau d'anniversaire.
C'est votre anniversaire ?
Quel âge...
Vous devez être jeune.
Vous le connaissez ?
Je ne l'ai jamais vu de ma vie.
lntéressant.
C'est une fleur fanée, Sydney,
pas le saint suaire.
Les affaires n'ont pas l'air
florissantes.
On a eu des soucis,
mais c'est fini.
Des soucis ?
- Mon associé est mort.
- Tom Miles ?
J'ai vu votre photo
dans le hangar.
ll a fait un saut
en plein milieu du désert.
ll aimait les défis.
Les défis ?
ll prenait une gourde, une boussole
et un couteau et revenait en stop.
C'était son rituel annuel.
Quelque chose a mal tourné
et il est mort.
Tout ce que je peux faire,
c'est réaliser son rêve :
faire de Blue Desert le meilleur
club de parachutisme du Texas.
On va avoir un nouvel avion
et une nouvelle salle
d'entraînement.
Tom le mérite.
Ca paie pas de mine,
mais il y a l'air conditionné,
le téléphone et un magnétoscope.
Et les serpents n'entrent pas.
Ca ira très bien.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici ?
J'avais à faire à Mason County.
Je venais vous inviter
à déjeuner.
Pain de viande au menu.
Sauf si je vous dérange.
Jarod Cochran,
le shérif Dwight Kunkle.
Jarod
est notre dernière recrue.
Vous venez d'où ?
D'un peu partout,
au gré du vent.
Et ce déjeuner ?
J'allais montrer à Jarod...
Allez-y, je me débrouillerai.
Enchanté.
Un champion de parachutisme
meurt dans le désert.
Vous êtes en retard.
Je vous attendais.
On m'a parlé d'un voyageur
cherchant la vérité.
Qui ?
Les Pères du Ciel.
Ceux qui parlent à mes tripes.
Vous avez besoin d'un guide.
Je ne comprends pas.
Vous me suivez ?
Comment il a fait ?
J'ai parcouru le fichier.
S'il travaille pour le Centre,
soit il a été effacé,
soit on n'y a pas accès.
J'ai accès à tout.
Et ça ?
Une torture.
Jarod joue.
Pourquoi ?
Pour me causer
une rupture d'anévrisme.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi,
mais il le fait.
- Et la photo ?
- Je l'ai agrandie.
Regardez.
Je n'ai qu'une rue.
''Black Ridge Lane''.
Je ne sais pas.
Peut-être...
qu'il veut juste vous torturer.
Zoomez là-dessus.
Le reflet sur le pare-brise.
Encore.
Encore une fois.
Le Maine.
Ca alors !
Je vais le prendre.
Ca va ?
J'ai lâché prise.
Venez vous asseoir.
J'ai un peu le vertige.
Vous voulez un verre d'eau ?
Je vais reprendre mon souffle.
Une question...
Qui êtes-vous ?
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Angela.
Je dois ranger ça.
Je m'en occupe.
Vous apprenez à sauter ?
Je viens d'être embauché.
Vous êtes le nouveau moniteur.
Vous semblez déçue.
Je ne pensais pas que Carol
prendrait quelqu'un si vite...
- Quoi ?
- Le bébé bouge.
ll ne doit pas aimer la chaleur.
C'est un garçon ?
Son père doit être fier.
Son père est mort.
Règle n°1 :
respectez votre matériel,
parce que sans lui,
vous êtes morts. Compris ?
Pour être en sûreté, on ouvre
son parachute à la bonne altitude.
On le fait en tirant
la poignée argentée, pas orange.
Prêt à essayer ?
On est au-dessus de la cible
et on saute.
Le sol fonce vers nous.
Vous êtes prêt à ouvrir
votre parachute.
Tirez la poignée argentée !
On y perd dans la traduction.
Benjamin Thomas Miller.
Célibataire.
Tient l'auberge locale.
Je cherche des crasses.
ll n'y en a pas.
ll n'a jamais eu de contravention.
- Pas encore.
- Pourquoi Jarod nous amène ici ?
ll ne l'a pas fait.
Le petit cahier rouge
vous était réservé.
C'est-à-dire ?
ll voulait que vous veniez seule.
ll est midi là où tu es.
Je recommande le Monte Cristo.
Rien de tel
qu'un sandwich au sirop.
C'est un peu calorique,
mais tu peux prendre
quelques kilos.
Qu'en sais-tu ?
On sait jamais
qui regarde par ta fenêtre.
On triche avec la balance
de la salle de bains...
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
La même chose que toi.
Des réponses.
Maintenant,
j'imagine que tu te diriges
vers le Green Ridge,
où Ben Miller finit son déjeuner :
Coca light,
sandwich bacon-crudités sans mayo.
Aucun détail ne t'échappe.
Je vais mettre mon numéro
sur liste rouge.
Ce sera facile de te retrouver
avec le bon code d'accès.
- Penses-y.
- Je voudrais bien,
mais je chasse des fantômes.
Ben Miller
est plutôt un squelette.
Un squelette ?
T'as regardé dans ton placard ?
Descendez.
- Pardon ?
- Descendez.
Essayez le Monte Cristo.
ll paraît que c'est excellent.
Prêt ? Sayonara !
C'est quoi, ça ?
C'est pour les tarés.
C'était géant.
Ca doit être bien
pour la neige.
Vous sautiez en parachute ?
J'ai fait un ou deux sauts.
Ca vous manque ?
La montée d'adrénaline.
Repousser les limites de son corps.
Le corps ne tient pas
toujours le choc.
Vous parlez de Tom Miles ?
Je l'ai emmené, ce jour-là.
Le pire, c'est que ça devait
être son dernier saut.
ll aurait tenu le club
sans sauter ?
Ce club survit à peine
depuis des années.
Tom s'en fichait pas mal.
C'était un type ordinaire.
L'important, c'était sa femme
et le bébé.
ll aimait cet endroit. ll voulait
pouvoir le partager avec son fils
avant qu'on vienne tout gâcher.
ll a poussé ses limites
une fois de trop.
Tom était un expert de la survie.
ll avait fait ce saut 12 fois
avant de mourir.
C'est pas parce qu'on peut
qu'on doit.
C'est le désert.
ll s'y passe
de drôles de choses.
Tant de mensonges.
Si peu de temps.
Vous n'avez rien à boire.
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Deux Plumes,
fils d'Aigle de Guerre.
Ca vous dit rien ?
Parce que les gens
m'appellent Ernie.
Je dirais que c'est une pêche.
Que voulez-vous ?
On m'a désigné
pour être votre guide.
Les Pères du Ciel
qui parlent à vos tripes.
- Où me guidez-vous ?
- A la vérité.
C'est un peu pompeux,
mais je suis un lndien.
Venez ce soir.
- Nous parlerons.
- Attendez.
Comment je trouverai ?
Suivez la voie du Cheval de Fer.
Du quoi ?
Du train !
Vous avez jamais vu
un film de John wayne ?
Et apportez le reste
de pain de viande.
J'en ai assez
de vos tours de magie !
Pas très accueillant.
Et le vieillard ?
Peu importe.
Je venais m'excuser
pour mon attitude d'hier.
- C'est rien.
- Non. Vous êtes nouveau.
Vous ne pouviez pas savoir.
- Je vous invite à dîner.
- Avec plaisir.
Vous aimez le pain de viande ?
J'arrive.
Vous désirez...
J'espérais que vous viendriez.
De quoi parlez-vous ?
Vous lui ressemblez.
A qui ?
A votre mère.
Shérif, vous auriez une minute ?
Je dois être à Dallas dans 3 h.
Une autre fois.
C'était au sujet de Tom Miles.
Une autre fois.
Quoi donc ?
Vous avez retrouvé son corps.
- En effet.
- Ca devait être affreux.
Un corps resté dans le désert...
trois jours ?
Quatre.
Je ne comprends pas
comment un expert de la survie
peut mourir de déshydratation ?
Qu'avez-vous à faire d'un mort ?
J'ai rencontré sa veuve.
Une dame charmante.
Peu importe.
Bonne journée.
Une autre question...
Y a-t-il eu une autopsie ?
Bien sûr. On vit dans la brousse,
mais on est pas des bouseux.
Merci beaucoup.
Elle a tout mangé ?
Pas étonnant qu'elle trouve plus
d'habits à sa taille !
Je te rappelle.
Bonjour.
Buddy Slocum, Jr.
Je représente la trésorerie
régionale du Sud-Ouest.
Le fisc ?
Puis-je parler
au shérif Dwight Knuckle ?
Kunkle.
ll s'appelle Kunkle.
Le shérif Knuckle... Kunkle
est à Dallas pour l'après-midi.
C'est très ennuyeux.
Buddy...
Je peux vous aider ?
En fait,
peut-être bien.
Avez-vous des informations
sur Thomas Miles ?
ll est mort.
Pas en ce qui concerne le fisc.
Merci encore, madame.
Tom devait finir
la chambre du bébé.
ll devait être heureux
d'être père.
C'était tout pour lui.
Avant de faire son dernier saut,
il m'a dit qu'il voulait
être un bon père,
apprendre la vie à notre fils.
ll disait
que la vie devait être vécue
et qu'il ne fallait pas
craindre la mort.
C'est pour ça qu'il sautait
dans le désert ?
Carol a raison.
C'est important
que son fils sache
qui était son père.
- Elle a dit ça ?
- Et que si le club ferme,
Tom sera mort en vain.
Son assurance tombe bien.
Comment ça ?
Ca servira aux rénovations.
Ca a été dur pour elle.
A cause des affaires ?
A cause de leur passé.
Carol et Tom étaient ensemble
avant que je le rencontre.
lls se sont séparés.
ll disait qu'elle était triste,
mais ne disait jamais
de mal d'elle.
C'est bien qu'elle veuille
réaliser son rêve.
Dis-moi que tu abandonnes.
Reconnais-le et j'arrête tout.
Je ne peux pas.
Je n'abandonnerai jamais.
Monsieur Deux Plumes ?
Vous pouvez arrêter de faire ça ?
Vous n'avez pas oublié.
Merci.
Votre pain de viande.
Et votre chapeau.
Merci. Asseyez-vous.
Vous vivez ici ?
Vous vous attendiez à un tipi ?
15 m² de confort,
le satellite...
J'ai même des films cochons,
grâce à Oncle Sam.
Oncle qui ?
Un différend concernant des terres
et leur propriétaire.
- Et vous vous êtes fixé là ?
- Sans discuter.
Les Blancs...
Comment on a pu perdre le pays ?
Vous deviez me guider
vers la vérité.
Ma famille vit sous ces cieux
depuis 7 générations.
J'ai vu bien des choses
dans le désert.
J'ai trouvé le corps
de celui qui foulait les nuages.
Je croyais que le shérif
l'avait trouvé.
Un lndien serait imprudent
d'arriver avec un héros blanc
accroché à sa caravane.
Comment un expert de la survie
peut-il mourir de déshydratation
avec des yuccas tout autour ?
Quand j'ai vu son visage, j'ai su.
D'après la police,
un animal l'aurait blessé.
Ce n'était pas un animal.
C'était sa folie.
J'ai vu ça une seule fois,
au cours d'une quête de vision.
Une quête de vision ?
Un jeune homme boit les racines
de la belladone
dans l'espoir d'accéder
au monde de l'au-delà.
Si le mélange est mauvais,
il peut se perdre, devenir fou.
La belladone.
Vous connaissez bien ?
Quand on vit dans le désert,
on sait ça.
Vos tripes vous parlent,
à vous aussi.
C'est pas mauvais.
Jarod est resté un mois.
C'est un sacré bricoleur.
C'est un génie.
Ca, je ne sais pas,
mais il pouvait
réparer un tracteur en parlant.
ll posait sans arrêt
des questions.
Je ne suis pas venue
parler de Jarod.
C'est drôle. Lui,
il ne voulait parler que de vous.
De moi ?
ll disait que vous aviez
grandi ensemble.
Ca l'a déçu
que je sache peu de choses.
Votre mère ne vous a jamais parlé
de cet endroit ?
Non, jamais.
Elle venait chaque année
à cette époque.
Elle adorait le printemps.
Elle aimait
ce qu'il faisait au monde.
Tante Dorothy...
Pardon ?
Elle disait qu'elle allait
chez sa soeur.
Elle avait ses raisons.
Quand votre mère n'est pas venue,
je me suis inquiété.
Je n'ai jamais su comment...
J'étais très jeune,
mais je me souviens
que sa mort a été...
soudaine.
ll y a des choses à elle ?
J'aimerais beaucoup voir
où elle a vécu.
Désolé, Carol.
Ca marche pas.
- Attends l'avion de Phoenix.
- L'Arizona ? lmpossible.
Tasco SportAventure.
Votre agence m'a été
chaudement recommandée.
Passez des vacances de rêve.
Saut à l'élastique au Bengale,
ski hors-piste dans les Andes,
chasse au requin...
Je voudrais sauter en parachute.
Ca tombe bien.
On va ouvrir un club à El Paso.
Ca m'a l'air intéressant.
Très intéressant.
Je vous rappellerai.
Merci de votre appel.
Recherché pour non-présentation
au contrôlejudiciaire.
Saloperie !
Allez, Crockett.
Plus que quelques jours à tenir.
- Vous m'avez fait peur.
- Pourquoi ?
Vous me preniez pour Carol ?
Elle vous fait peur, Crockett ?
Ou devrais-je dire Angus ?
Angus Marin.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Quelqu'un qui sait que vous êtes
recherché et qui va s'en servir,
comme Carol.
Vous avez bu ce remède ?
Carol veut toucher
l'assurance de Tom
pour rénover ce club
et le vendre plus cher à Tasco.
Je sais aussi que vous toucherez
25% de la part de Carol.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi.
Vous savez qu'elle a tué
Tom Miles,
ou vous l'avez aidée ?
C'était sa chambre.
Je n'ai touché à rien
depuis son départ.
Quoi ?
En vous voyant là,
j'ai cru revoir Catherine.
Appelez-moi.
Sauvés
Tom et Carol ont acheté
cet endroit ensemble,
mais Tom avait 60%.
Après leur rupture,
il a épousé Angela.
ll voulait s'installer ici.
Carol voulait vendre,
il n'avait pas l'argent.
Ca a fini par tomber en ruine
et 40% de rien,
- c'est rien.
- Et les gens de Tasco sont venus.
Avec leurs dollars.
Mais Tom refusait
qu'on rase le club.
Carol était coincée.
Elle s'est braquée.
Et que s'est-il passé ?
Le matin du saut de Tom,
elle a changé sa gourde.
Sur le coup, j'ai pas fait gaffe.
Ca voulait rien dire.
Plus tard, quand il est mort,
j'y ai repensé
et quand je lui ai demandé...
Elle a menacé de vous dénoncer ?
Elle m'a offert un pourcentage
pour l'aider jusqu'à la vente.
On était sur la même
longueur d'onde :
prêts à se haïr assez longtemps
pour toucher le fric
et vivre notre vie.
Malheureusement, Tom Miles
ne pourra pas vivre la sienne.
J'aimerais commander
des côtes de boeuf.
Fantastique,
mais je les voudrais crues.
C'est ça, crues.
Si le premier arrivé à Phoenix
a l'avion,
j'y arriverai le premier.
Vous avez vu Crockett ?
Un problème ?
Phoenix a un autre acheteur,
pour l'avion.
lls vendront au premier arrivé.
C'est pas plus
de 6 ou 7 h de route.
Je n'ai pas 6 ou 7 heures.
Je peux vous emmener en avion.
Vous êtes pilote ?
On peut décoller quand ?
Dans vingt minutes.
Le café est prêt.
- Vous avez bien dormi ?
- Oui.
Mieux que ça, en fait.
C'est cet endroit qui fait ça.
Vous n'emportez rien d'elle ?
J'ai tout ce qu'il me faut.
Et puis, sa place est ici.
Vous l'aimiez, n'est-ce pas ?
Votre mère
était une femme à part.
D'un côté, je la connaissais
mieux que personne,
mais elle gardait une part secrète.
Elle parlait de lui ?
Non.
Elle l'oubliait en venant ici.
Mais sa petite fille
lui manquait toujours.
Je vous apporte
le petit déjeuner.
Pourquoi allons-nous au nord ?
La météo.
On annonce une tempête.
C'est plus sûr
de la contourner.
On arrive bientôt ?
Une heure, une heure et demie.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
On perd de la pression.
Sans doute le réservoir.
C'est impossible
d'atterrir ici.
Le carburant risquerait
de tout faire exploser.
On va devoir sauter.
Du calme, on est moniteurs
de parachute,
vous vous souvenez ?
Comment ça, il était poli ?
Vous donnez des dossiers secrets
à tous ceux qui vous sourient ?
ll a dit qu'il était du fisc.
- Je vous ai dit mille fois...
- Alpha Tango 997 !
S.O.S. Je répète : S.O.S.
Notre avion est en feu.
On va sauter à environ 60 km
au nord de Fort Hancock.
997... C'est l'avion de Carol.
Alertez
la patrouille de secours.
Vous me déposez ?
Ca va ?
Je me suis cassé la jambe.
Vous en faites pas.
On nous trouvera.
Pas si sûr.
Personne ne saurait
qu'on est là ?
Je ne sais pas
si mon appel est passé.
Vous proposez quoi ?
ll reste environ 7 h de jour.
En voyageant léger,
vous serez à Fort Hancock ce soir.
Et si je n'y arrive pas ?
Vous y arriverez.
Allez vers le sud.
Vous avez une gourde pleine.
Pensez à boire.
Sinon, vous finirez comme Tom.
A bientôt.
Comptez sur moi.
Qui va là ?
Qu'est-ce qui m'arrive ?
La même chose qu'à Tom.
Vous imaginez
ce qu'il a ressenti,
ces derniers instants
avant de mourir,
tout seul...
Tom, excuse-moi !
Vous avez mis de la belladone
dans sa gourde.
Plus le soleil tapait,
plus il délirait
sous l'effet du poison.
Chaque minute
était une longue agonie.
Quand il a compris
qu'il ne verrait jamais son bébé,
il s'est mis à tourner en rond
et à se griffer le corps
pour combattre la folie
que vous lui aviez infligée...
Le club et une famille...
Tu m'as pris tout ça
pour le lui donner.
ll ne me restait plus rien !
Alors, vous avez fait une veuve
et un orphelin.
Je voulais ce que je méritais.
Quelque chose me dit
que c'est ce que vous aurez.
Avec un tel instinct,
tu vas m'attraper.
Pas si tu m'égares.
Je ne t'ai pas égarée.
Je t'ai mise sur une autre voie.
C'est tout ce que tu fais ?
Fouiller le passé ?
C'est facile à dire pour toi.
Tu en as un.
Même si ce n'est pas
celui que tu croyais.
Bon anniversaire.
Au dodo.
Salut, homme blanc.
Je suis venu dire au revoir
et merci.
Alors, adieu et... de rien.
Quand vous avez parlé
de m'aider à trouver la vérité,
j'espérais que ce serait
la vérité sur moi-même,
sur qui je suis.
Chacun fait le voyage
qu'il est censé faire.
Pour certains, il est clair.
Pour d'autres, il l'est moins.
Je suis sur la bonne voie ?
Continuez d'écouter vos tripes.
Que vois-tu, Jarod ?
Je n'en suis pas sûr.
Réfléchis.
Réfléchis, Jarod.
Qu'est-ce que ça signifie ?
Ces gens...
Certains sont en colère,
d'autres sont tristes.
Pour la même raison.
Laquelle ?
Leur confiance a été trahie...
par quelqu'un
qu'ils respectaient.
Et maintenant...
ils n'ont plus confiance en lui.
M. Harrigan ?
- On est tous là ?
- O'Leary y est encore.
O'Leary, sortez de là.
C'est foutu !
O'Leary, au rapport.
Maman, où es-tu ?
Au secours !
Ca va aller.
Sortez de là, O'Leary !
C'est mon enfant !
Merci.
Je ne fais que mon boulot.
Comme ça,
M. Raines nous l'a prêté ?
Oui, Mlle Parker.
Pouvez-vous me dire pourquoi ?
Sachant que le modus operandi
de Jarod, jusqu'ici,
est de découper des articles...
Si on établit un lien
entre ces articles
et ses déplacements,
on peut savoir où il ira
en cherchant des articles
susceptibles de l'intéresser.
Et La Chose est l'homme
de la situation ?
Ne soyez pas méprisante.
ll s'appelle Angelo.
ll n'est pas ordinaire.
Je vois !
A peine arrivé,
t'es déjà un héros.
Je pensais que c'était foutu.
Et toi,
tu vas dans la fournaise !
Ne fais pas ça à la maison.
C'est moins risqué au boulot.
68,6% des blessures graves
ont lieu à la maison.
Prendre un bain est plus risqué
qu'éteindre un feu.
Je me dirigeais vers la sortie.
Où je peux ranger ça ?
Suis-moi.
Prends n'importe quel casier
où y a pas de nom.
Pas celui-ci.
Désolé. Je savais pas.
Lieutenant Gleason ?
J'aurais dû te prévenir.
C'était le casier
de Tamara Copeland.
Le pompier qui est mort ?
Elle et Gleason étaient proches.
Ton arrivée tourne la page
là-dessus.
Ou rouvre la plaie.
Vous voilà.
Un jour de travail
et vous assurez comme un pro.
Prenez exemple, Roy.
Du cran, de la jugeote
et un doigt de folie.
C'est ça, la 16e brigade.
Les journalistes
veulent faire connaissance.
Je ne veux pas de publicité.
Vous faites partie de la meilleure
brigade de la ville.
Soyez-en fier.
Et c'est bien pour l'équipe.
Entendu.
Fais risette.
Dans combien de temps
votre idiot savant
trouvera où est Jarod ?
Angelo n'est pas
un idiot savant.
En fait, nous ne savons pas
comment le répertorier.
Pensez à lui
comme à une éponge.
ll n'a aucune personnalité,
mais il peut absorber
celle qu'on lui présente.
ll a lu tout
ce que nous avons sur Jarod.
Donc, maintenant,
c'est un Caméléon ?
ll n'est pas capable
de jugement moral...
ni de s'évader.
J'ai déjà entendu ça
quelque part.
lncroyable !
- Ca remonte à quand ?
- Trop longtemps.
- Que fais-tu là ?
- Voyage d'affaires.
Je vends des produits
pharmaceutiques.
C'est mon territoire.
Et toi ?
J'ai un poste pas mal
dans une firme locale.
Rien de bien folichon.
Tu es incroyablement belle.
Malgré ma misère sexuelle.
Michael Patrick.
Sydney.
Mon assistant.
Enfin,
je te paierais bien
un verre, mais...
Sydney allait partir.
Oui, apparemment,
Sydney allait partir.
Parfait.
Je t'attends au bar.
Je vous retrouve au bureau.
Voyons.
Je me fais les ongles,
je me lave les cheveux,
je fume une cigarette.
Et vous parlez tout seul.
Et alors ?
J'enquête sur les incendies.
Jarod O'Leary, de la 16e brigade.
J'ai entendu parler de vous.
Vous avez sauvé la gamine.
Harrigan doit faire le fanfaron.
- John Zimmerman.
- Je vous connais.
Vous avez arrêté le pyromane
de North Hills.
Ca n'a pas rempli
mon carnet de bal.
Les héros comme vous
récoltent les lauriers.
Vous pourriez m'en raconter.
Je connais l'histoire du singe
et de l'homme au chapeau jaune.
J'ai pigé.
Personne veut me causer,
sauf s'il y a un feu.
Et alors,
c'est que des questions.
Pourquoi avoir choisi
ce métier ?
J'avais pas le choix.
Les gars qui aiment le feu
comme moi
sont pyromanes ou pompiers.
Je suis dans la 2e catégorie.
- Ca va ?
- Saleté de genou.
Le sport ?
Vous rigolez ?
Je voulais pas vous vexer.
Je peux me lancer ?
Allez-y.
On sait que la personne fumait.
Elle fumait une cigarette,
se faisait les ongles.
Elle s'est endormie,
a lâché sa cigarette
et le vernis a pris feu.
Pas mal, mais c'est faux.
Court-circuit.
Comment êtes-vous sûr ?
ll y avait une surcharge.
Les brûlures sont concentrées
sur les murs.
Le vernis
a pris feu bien après.
Encore une catastrophe inutile
résolue.
lmpressionnant.
Vous savez, le plus triste...
Ce matelas Simmons...
ma vie sexuelle se limite à ça.
Long déjeuner...
Pas ennuyeux, pour une fois.
Ca avance ?
Lentement mais sûrement.
On peut être sûr à 90%
que Jarod va
à l'est du Mississippi.
Angelo a éliminé
tout ce qui est à l'ouest.
L'étau se resserre.
Vous ne sortez jamais, Broots ?
Appelez-moi
s'il y a du nouveau.
Où serez-vous ?
Sortie.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Mlle Parker éprouve soudain
un grand intérêt
pour l'industrie pharmaceutique.
Ember gronde
après tous les inconnus.
Je dois remuer longtemps ?
Jusqu'à ce que ça coagule.
C'est le mot.
ll te prend pour un chien.
- C'est vrai ?
- Tu es nouveau, ici.
ll cherche à te dominer.
- Vraiment ?
- T'as jamais eu de chien ?
Non, mais j'ai emmené un singe
en Amazonie.
ll va t'adorer.
Les chiens sont très loyaux.
Nourris-les, ils t'obéiront.
Lâchez un peu ce clebs.
On a faim.
Ca vient, chef.
Voilà pourquoi t'as été muté !
- C'est quoi ?
- Des compléments nutritionnels.
Coeurs de palmiers,
blé et asperges
à la tomate.
J'ai grandi avec.
Vomi avec, plutôt !
Un seul truc peut nous sauver !
lnsta-fromage !
On mange mal
depuis la mort de Copeland.
Lieu du décès :
entrepôt de Tri-River
Mort par asphyxie
Un pompier périt
dans l'incendie de Tri-River
Morte dans l'exercice
de ses fonctions
Les pompiers pleurent
l'une des leurs
ll est par terre,
je suis sur lui.
On est épuisés,
trempés de sueur...
Tu le fais toujours ?
Au moins 3 fois par semaine.
C'est pas dur,
de maintenir l'intensité ?
Pas si c'est bien fait.
Tu ne le fais plus du tout ?
Non. A vrai dire,
j'ai arrêté l'escrime
après la fac.
Je n'ai jamais trouvé
d'adversaire
aussi vaillante que toi.
Ca ne risque pas.
Tu as toujours ce regard.
Mi-engageant, mi-intimidant.
Lequel désires-tu ?
Ne me tente pas.
Trop tard.
L'addition, s'il vous plaît.
Produit alimentaire aérosol
aromatisé au fromage.
Nourriture officielle de la 16e.
Apparemment,
ça n'a aucune valeur nutritive.
J'adore le goût et ça me fait
dormir comme un bébé.
Je vais guère dormir, ici.
Les lits sont graves.
Tu t'y feras.
J'ai parcouru
vos états de service.
Vous êtes bons.
92% de réussite.
Meilleure brigade de la ville.
Je tâcherai d'être à la hauteur.
Ecoute Harrigan, tout ira bien.
Je l'ai vu répondre seul
à une alerte 6
et l'éteindre avant
l'arrivée des renforts.
ll a l'air d'aimer
la manière forte,
sauf pour les entrepôts.
Vous êtes arrivés
avant que la structure s'écroule,
mais chaque fois,
Harrigan vous a retenus.
lls étaient BPC.
BPC ?
Bons Pour la Casse.
ll ne voulait pas
risquer ses hommes.
Vivre pour se battre.
Jarod, tu vas trouver
ta place, ici.
C'est comme j'ai dit.
Fais confiance à Harrigan.
ll s'occupe de nous.
C'est joli, chez toi.
Qu'en sais-tu ?
Tu n'as pas vu la chambre.
A ce rythme, ça ne risque pas.
On boit un verre ?
Tu n'es pas fatiguée !
Je commence à peine
à être chaude.
Dans ce cas, je veux un verre.
Je n'en reviens pas.
Tant d'énergie gâchée
dans la vente...
N'oublie pas,
sans ce boulot,
je ne serais pas là.
Tu pars quand ?
Tu en as déjà assez ?
Je suis là encore...
deux jours.
Pas de temps à perdre.
Tenez, messieurs.
Mangez sainement.
Nancy, qu'est-ce qui t'amène ?
Je passais vous apporter
votre linge.
- T'es pas obligée.
- Ca me fait plaisir.
- Les affaires marchent ?
- Depuis ce matin.
En plus, Manny est malade.
Qui fait la cuisine ?
Je fais quoi de ces boulettes ?
Vous vous connaissez.
Je m'en occupe
si vous finissez de nettoyer.
Attention, c'est chaud.
Un type en or.
Vous n'avez rien à faire ici.
J'étais là quand le cuisinier
a appelé. Je me suis proposé.
Vous auriez fait pareil.
Vous voulez quoi ?
Une trêve.
Vous et moi,
on a pris un mauvais départ.
Sachez que je comprends
ce que vous devez ressentir.
Tamara Copeland
était votre meilleure amie.
Je ne veux pas la remplacer.
Juste faire mon travail.
Prenez ces assiettes.
Ce ne sera pas facile.
Quoi ?
De vous détester.
Cette fille m'inquiète.
Comment ça ?
Elle ne se remet pas
de ce qui est arrivé.
Elle se reproche
la mort de Tamara.
C'était un accident, non ?
Ma fille était
un pompier hors pair
et je l'aimais plus que tout,
mais elle savait
son métier dangereux...
et certains meurent.
Je vais voir ces boulettes.
Broots, une nouvelle possibilité.
Faillite d'une usine de fumage
Je pense à un Etat de l'intérieur.
Pennsylvanie, Virginie de l'ouest.
Ce n'est pas une science exacte.
C'est une technique expérimentale
avec un gros facteur humain.
Pas dormi de la nuit ?
Je vous apporte un café.
Ca vous fera du bien.
Qui a amené ce clebs ?
Coupable.
Qu'il reste dehors.
On retire ses chaussures.
Ce carrelage italien
m'a coûté 20$ le mètre.
Un roi dans son château...
Je vais devoir
creuser une douve.
Le chef a fait le bar.
Je vais faire un garage
cet été.
Ca a dû vous coûter une fortune.
Et de l'huile de coude.
Surtout la nôtre.
Allez voir les steaks.
Les laissez pas brûler.
Brave gars.
Pas très dégourdi,
mais brave.
Cette barre...
Camion de pompier 1934.
Le premier de la 16e brigade.
Harrigan s'en est beaucoup servi.
Et pas pendant le travail.
Vous êtes dans une unité
très spéciale.
Historique, je dirais.
La première unité
avec 2 femmes pompiers.
Avec Gleason et Copeland,
on se sentait en famille.
Nancy regrette
beaucoup Copeland.
Comme nous tous.
Elle a eu du cran, pour aller
dans l'entrepôt en flammes.
ll devait faire plus chaud
qu'en enfer.
Copeland était bonne,
mais elle cherchait trop
à être héroïque.
J'ai retenu l'équipe,
mais elle a foncé
sans protection.
Ce n'était pas dans la presse.
Copeland faisait du bon boulot.
Je ne voulais pas ternir
son image.
J'ai demandé une lance
et je suis allé la chercher.
A mon arrivée,
elle avait été happée par le feu.
Disparue.
C'était courageux.
Le courage
n'a rien à voir là-dedans.
Je ne laisserai jamais tomber
un des nôtres.
Vous ne croyez pas
à ma bonne humeur ?
Je vous connais trop.
Ne soyez pas si sûr.
Mais je suis inquiet.
M. Patrick me semble très...
mobile.
Mes distractions
ne regardent que moi.
Et puis, il me plaît.
Posez-vous cette question :
y a-t-il suffisamment
de relations saines dans votre vie
pour compenser vos distractions ?
Ces liaisons
ne sont pas
sans répercussions affectives.
Laissez-moi
vous donner un conseil, Syd.
Vous ne savez rien de moi.
Et votre inquiétude,
bien que touchante,
est déplacée.
C'est notre meilleur repas
depuis des mois.
Merci.
Comment êtes-vous devenu
cordon bleu ?
lnsta-fromage.
En fait, c'est une recette
de Tamara Copeland.
Je voulais bien faire.
Vous avez bien fait.
Faire la cuisine de Copeland,
ça la fait revivre.
On veut pas l'oublier.
Non, en effet.
Que vois-tu, Jarod ?
- Je ne suis pas sûr.
- Réfléchis, Jarod.
Qu'est-ce que ça signifie ?
Regarde les visages.
Ces gens...
Certains sont en colère,
d'autres tristes.
Pour la même raison.
Laquelle ?
Un homme les a trahis...
qui a tué les siens.
Oui. Et ?...
lls n'ont plus confiance
en leur chef.
Que vois-tu, Jarod ?
Qu'est-ce que ça signifie ?
Réfléchis, Jarod.
Qu'est-ce que ça signifie ?
C'est délicieux, ici.
De quoi parler tout seul.
C'est bon.
Vous me payez un sandwich
à la dinde.
Vous faites pas d'illusions.
Des illusions ?
Je plaisante.
J'ai des questions à vous poser.
Normal.
J'essaie de piger
les types d'incendies
et j'ai parié avec Roy
que celui-ci était dû
à un court-circuit.
Payez-le.
Pourquoi ?
Vous voyez
la traînée qui part
du centre de la pièce ?
Toutes les flammes
sont sous les prises.
Un coup monté.
lncendie criminel.
Vous mangez ce cornichon ?
On l'a attribué
à un court-circuit.
Celui qui a dit ça
est un crétin.
Je crains que ce crétin,
ce soit vous.
C'était votre enquête.
L'incendie de l'entrepôt
de Tri-River.
Vous vous souvenez ?
Elle y a laissé sa peau,
en voulant sauver la vôtre.
Vous dites n'importe quoi.
Vous êtes allé à l'hôpital
le soir de sa mort,
pour une brûlure au dos.
Je sais aussi que Harrigan
a laissé brûler 3 autres entrepôts
et que vous avez conclu
à l'accident.
La prime d'assurance,
elle est morte pour ça ?
- Alors, ces sandwichs ?
- Fabuleux.
On vous doit...
Rien du tout.
Vous êtes de la famille.
Un entrepôt s'effondre,
un supermarché est construit.
L'assurance paie le tout.
Pas de bobo.
Jusqu'à ce soir-là.
Je devais juste
verser de l'alcool par terre,
casser des tuyaux,
simuler le court-circuit.
Une fois que le feu avait pris,
je me préparais à partir,
mais mon genou a lâché
et j'étais coincé.
D'où votre brûlure ?
Y avait des flammes partout.
Ma chemise a pris feu.
J'ai eu si mal que j'ai crié.
Tamara Copeland vous a entendu.
J'ai rampé jusqu'au conduit
que j'avais construit
pour me cacher des pompiers,
mais je suffoquais
et je me suis évanoui.
J'ai cru y passer.
Et puis je l'ai vue
émerger des flammes.
Elle a dû vous reconnaître.
Elle a su que j'avais mis le feu,
mais Ca l'a pas arrêtée.
Elle a continué
à faire son boulot.
Au lieu de sauver sa propre vie,
elle a sauvé la mienne.
Et Harrigan est arrivé.
ll l'a frappée avec une pince
et m'a dit de filer.
ll voulait pas porter le chapeau.
ll a pris son oxygène
et me l'a passé
comme si de rien n'était.
Elle voulait juste vous sauver.
Et elle est morte dans cet enfer.
Quoi ?
On va finir par arriver
à ta chambre ?
Ne gâchons pas le plaisir.
Ne réponds pas.
Je suis obligée.
Quoi ?
Nous l'avons localisé,
Mlle Parker.
Angelo ?
ll est incroyable.
ll a gardé 5 coupures.
C'est une usine de fumage
à Pittsburgh.
Jarod y était récemment.
Sa piste doit être chaude.
Usine de fumage à Pittsburgh ?
Appelez Sydney. J'arrive.
Jolie famille.
Va la retrouver.
Ton voyage d'affaires est fini.
Lieutenant ?
- J'ai une chose à vous montrer.
- Entrez.
C'est une feuille de présence.
Du soir où Tamara Copeland
est morte.
Si c'est une blague,
c'est pas drôle.
Si c'est un souvenir,
j'en ai pas besoin.
Vous auriez dû travailler
ce soir-là,
mais elle vous a remplacée.
Ca aurait dû être moi.
Je sais que vous pensez ça,
mais voyez l'autre côté
de la pièce.
D'autres feuilles ?
Des fois
où vous l'avez remplacée.
On connaît tous les risques.
Ne vous reprochez rien.
Je n'étais pas là pour elle.
Peut-être pas ce soir-là,
mais vous le pouvez maintenant.
Ce Jarod Vronsky
était une bénédiction.
Je ne pensais pas
qu'on survivrait,
après la mort de mon père.
Jarod a laissé quelque chose ?
ll a augmenté la productivité,
restructuré notre stratégie
d'investissement
et ouvert une mutuelle dentaire.
En échange, il ne demandait
qu'à s'asseoir ici.
Pourquoi rester assis
dans une usine de fumage ?
Jarod pense en métaphores.
ll peut aussi bien
être pompier
que cracheur de feu.
ll aimait la fumée.
ll voulait s'en imbiber.
Jarod n'aurait pas laissé
un cahier rouge ?
Je répète que je n'ai rien.
- Vous répétez ?
- J'ai du travail.
Combien de vos employés
devraient rentrer en Ukraine
si les services de l'immigration
venaient ici ?
Je l'ai donné à l'autre homme.
- Qui ?
- Un homme est venu il y a 1 h.
ll savait des choses sur lui.
ll disait que d'autres gens
viendraient
et qu'ils lui voulaient du mal.
Broots est le seul
à savoir.
Quoi ?
Ca y est.
Je sais exactement où est Jarod.
Acte de bravoure
Une enfant sauvée des flammes
A toi de jouer, Ember.
Tu peux le faire.
C'est facile.
Allez, tu peux y arriver.
C'est facile.
Regarde.
Comme ça.
Tu peux le faire.
Qui a vu Zimmerman ?
ll m'a appelé.
ll vient de sortir.
ll avait l'air bizarre, agité.
ll a dit où il allait ?
ll a laissé ça.
lls savent tout.
Rendez-vous chez vous.
Un problème ?
Zimmerman, vous êtes là ?
Saleté de clébard !
Harrigan !
C'est pas des manières.
Ca va pas ?
J'ai appris un tour à Ember.
Je m'en fous.
Détachez-moi.
C'est le meilleur ami de l'homme,
vous savez.
Et si on le nourrit bien,
il fera tout pour vous.
Son mets préféré,
comme vous,
c'est lnsta-fromage.
C'est pas très sain,
mais ça a bon goût.
Si je sors d'ici,
je vous tords le cou.
Je vous laisserai pas sortir.
Passons à notre tour.
Eclaire la maison.
Brave chien.
Pas mal, hein ?
Mais il y a mieux.
Qu'est-ce qui vous prend ?
Un court-circuit
causé par un chien.
Terrible accident.
- Eteignez.
- J'aimerais,
mais je sais pas comment.
Je suis pas un vrai pompier.
Encore un !
Détachez-moi !
Je dois téléphoner.
16e brigade.
Je signale un incendie.
16 309, Ellsworth Terrace.
Merci.
Pourvu que la 16e brigade
arrive à temps.
Le feu se propage vite
dans ces murs,
mais ce n'est pas une surprise.
J'ai traité les fils électriques
à l'alcool.
Le feu se propagera
complètement
et ça aura l'air d'un accident.
Personne ne saura rien.
Et moi ?
Même les meilleurs
font des erreurs,
pas vrai, chef ?
La clé !
ll a l'air d'avoir peur, hein ?
Tamara a dû avoir peur aussi,
le soir de l'incendie
à Tri-River.
Mais vous étiez là.
Elle avait confiance en vous.
Va dehors, Ember.
Ne te brûle pas.
Attendez. ll y a une chose
que vous devez savoir.
Je vais y aller.
On commence à étouffer,
là-dedans.
O'Leary, me laissez pas !
Pourquoi ? Vous avez bien
laissé Tamara Copeland.
- Oui.
- Vous l'avez laissée brûler
pour toucher l'assurance,
pour vous payer ce carrelage
ou ce bar
dont vous êtes si fier.
Oui, je l'ai laissée.
Donnez-moi la clé !
Celle-ci ?
D'accord.
Ne vous brûlez pas.
Ma maison !
Cet enfoiré a mis le feu
à ma maison !
Eteignez-le.
Ne bougez pas.
Cet endroit est BPC.
Je l'ai construite.
La laissez pas brûler.
Je suis votre chef, merde !
Allez vous faire voir !
Vous devez être Jarod.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Me posez pas de questions.
Les mains en l'air
et tournez-vous.
Au revoir.
Merci beaucoup.
Je dois partir.
Content de t'avoir connu.
Allez derrière.
Les autres, suivez-moi.
Pour qui tu travailles ?
Je te l'ai dit, Parker.
Je vends des...
Salope !
Et tu n'as rien vu.
Pour qui tu travailles ?
Pour le Centre.
M. Raines.
Ne faites pas ça.
ll y aurait des répercussions.
Au fait, je simulais.
On peut pas manger ça.
Même mon chien en voudrait pas.
Je vais arranger ça.

ll s'appelle Angelo.
Voyez-le comme une ťponge.
ll absorbe
les caractťristiques
intellectuelles et physiques
des autres.
ll retrouvera Jarod.
ll a intťrÍt, Sydney.
Oui, M. Parker.
ll cherche
sa trace sur lnternet.
On le retrouvera,
ainsi que la personne qui l'aide
au Centre.
Continue ŗ travailler, Angelo.
Si tu t'approches trop de Áa,
tu te gratteras le nez
avec un moignon.
Vous Ítes pas majeurs, dites ?
C'est bien ce que je pensais.
Remplis leur coffre, Eugene.
Oý on en ťtait ?
Vous parliez de M. Nobel.
Nobel ťtait un peu
le Picasso de la poudre.
ll a inventť la Grosse Bertha.
Pardon ?
La mŤre de toutes les fusťes.
Trois explosions ŗ retardement
dans un pťtard
ŗ fumťe de couleur
avec de fines couches de TNT.
lmpressionnant.
Ca donne un rťveillon
ŗ faire p‚lir les ťtoiles.
Je sais pas oý il est.
ll a disparu...
Oui, c'est dans ses habitudes.
Jarod ne pouvait pas savoir
qu'on viendrait.
lmpossible !
Ca ne marche jamais
dans l'autre sens.
ll y a peut-Ítre une raison.
Relax, Nobel.
On est filmťs
pour la postťritť.
Par ici.
D'aprŤs le fax,
la bombe est par ici.
Carlson !
Une Betty Butťe.
Comme toujours avec le Faxeur.
Betty a besoin de repos.
Faut pas s'endormir
ŗ cŰtť d'elle.
Les outils.
Regarde.
- On dirait un mot.
- C'est sa signature.
Ca dit quoi ?
''Attrapez-moi, mťcrťants.''
Mťcrťants ? Ca veut dire quoi ?
On dťgage !
Ca arrive souvent ?
Bienvenue ŗ l'unitť
de dťsamorÁage, Jarod.
Alors, Nobel,
on a fait connaissance
avec le Faxeur Fou, hein ?
J'aurais aimť Ítre lŗ.
Je ne comprends pas pourquoi.
Mes oreilles bourdonnent encore.
Avant, le fumier qui posait
une bombe passait un coup de fil.
- Maintenant, on faxe.
- Fumier ?
Un mťcrťant.
Miracle ! Lamont a plaisantť.
Ce type faxe
ses menaces.
C'est le seul ŗ faire Áa.
Ca l'aide ŗ nous semer.
Pour Áa, pas besoin d'aide.
On pourrait trouver
des preuves
gr‚ce ŗ la technologie :
ADN, cheveux,
fibres, empreintes...
Ce type ne nous laisse rien.
On finira bien par trouver.
Restez ici
et occupez-vous de Áa.
Je vais mentir ŗ la presse.
Tu t'es encore pris de l'acier ?
Si tu faisais du cafť
aux hťros ?
ll m'adore !
Ca t'est dťjŗ arrivť ?
J'ai reÁu un ťclat d'obus
ŗ la guerre.
Lui seul voit
la Grenade comme une guerre.
J'ai des mťdailles.
Seules comptent
celles de ton frŤre au ViÍtnam.
Tu as dťsamorcť
deux bombes du Faxeur.
Un coup de chance.
Ne t'en fais pas.
Un jour, il fera un faux pas.
Et je serai lŗ pour l'attraper.
J'espŤre que le salaud
sautera tout seul.
Le dťtonateur ťtait reliť
ŗ un accťlťrateur.
C'est une dangereuse innovation
pour le Faxeur Fou.
Distribuez Áa.
C'est le profil du plastiqueur.
ll y a aussi un portrait-robot
fait par ordinateur,
basť
sur des informations incomplŤtes.
On dirait mon oncle Fred.
On dirait notre oncle ŗ tous !
D'aprŤs ses menaces par fax,
le plastiqueur est gaucher,
ex-employť municipal.
ll a dťjŗ dŻ exprimer
son mťcontentement.
Alors ?
Les dossiers des tordus !
Bravo, Lamont.
J'espŤre
que vous ne compterez pas
les heures
pour examiner ces dossiers
et interroger
tout coupable ťventuel.
Des questions ?
Parfait. Au travail.
Vous avez un moment,
M. Chomsky ?
Bien sŻr.
J'ai lu le dossier. Avec tout
le respect que je vous dois...
Quand on dit Áa,
c'est qu'on manque de respect !
Je pense
que votre profil du coupable
correspond ŗ ce qu'il veut
qu'on croie.
Tout ce qu'il nous laisse croire
est une fausse piste.
On veut me piquer ma place ?
J'ai un autre avis, c'est tout.
Qui repose sur quoi ?
Je connais les gens.
Je vous ťcoute.
Pour l'ADN et les empreintes,
on est bredouilles.
ll nous entraÓne sur la voie
de la technologie,
mais on peut le coincer
plus simplement.
ll est droitier,
mais prťtend Ítre gaucher.
Le trait est dentelť,
il ťcrit donc
avec sa main sous-dominante.
Vous Ítes aussi graphologue ?
Non, je lis
dans les lignes de la main.
Curieux de votre avenir ici ?
Le plastiqueur
travaille ŗ la mairie
et n'est pas forcťment mťcontent.
ll aime nous faire marcher
autant que poser des bombes.
Si vous pensez que
c'est un joyeux farceur,
vous devriez voir Rachel Newton.
Elle apprend ŗ lire en braille
ŗ cause du Faxeur Fou.
- Je ne veux pas minimiser...
- Je sais.
Vous vouliez m'impressionner,
montrer votre ťducation europťenne.
- Pardon ?
- Votre intonation.
Vous avez eu une gouvernante
franÁaise, voire belge.
Comment le savez-vous ?
Moi aussi, je connais les gens.
Bon sang, Broots !
- Je croyais qu'on le tenait.
- Je ne comprends pas.
- Normal, avec Jarod...
- Je vous en prie !
J'en ai assez de toujours avoir
une longueur de retard sur lui.
Moi aussi.
- J'y vais...
- Restez, M. Broots.
Qu'est-ce qui vous amŤne ?
La plomberie.
Je viens colmater une fuite.
Quoi de neuf, Nobel ?
Le Faxeur Fou,
alias oncle Fred.
J'ai fait mieux,
mais personne ne l'a bien vu,
alors le croquis est sommaire.
Fascinant !
C'est un poste
d'infographie.
Ce chenapan fait des composites,
modifie les portraits,
vieillit les enfants disparus.
C'est ce que je fais actuellement.
lncroyable !
Les disparitions,
c'est ma spťcialitť.
Cet appareil
vaut M. TÍte de Patate.
Qui Áa ?
M. TÍte de Patate.
C'est intťressant.
On l'appelle comme Áa
et sa tÍte est tout son corps ?
Ouais ! Gťnial, non ?
ll a des oreilles, des yeux
et des chapeaux interchangeables.
L'homme-patate
est le roi du dťguisement !
Ca ferait un bon jouet
pour enfants.
On a une piste. Allons-y !
Qu'est-ce qu'il a fait ?
Curtis !
lls viennent enfin t'arrÍter !
Je suis occupť !
On ne vient pas
arrÍter votre fils.
Je savais qu'un jour
les flics l'emmŤneraient.
L‚che-moi, je te dis !
A 30 ans,
il vit dans mon sous-sol.
ll passe son temps
ŗ ťcrire des lettres.
J'aurais dŻ acheter
des actions chez Bic.
Ne dis rien !
Tout est sŻrement enregistrť.
Ecoutez Áa !
Vous savez ce qu'il a fait
de ma vie sociale ?
Vous tirerez rien de moi !
Je suis dans la fleur de l'‚ge.
Je devrais acheter des chaussures
et me trouver un homme.
Vous avez ťcrit ŗ la mairie ?
Je veux
qu'on me rende mon travail.
J'ai attrapť une hernie
en travaillant
et on me met au placard !
Qui Ítes-vous ?
Je m'appelle Carlson.
Voici Nobel.
Je ne vois pas
le numťro de la plaque.
ll n'a pas de hernie.
ll veut pas bouger, c'est tout.
Tais-toi.
Je peux pas
rester assis longtemps.
Je sais oý tu t'assois !
On n'est pas lŗ
pour parler de votre emploi.
On voudrait vous interroger...
Alors, revenez avec un mandat !
On a rien ŗ vous dire,
mťcrťants !
J'aurais dŻ ťpouser ce dentiste.
Au moins,
il aurait de bonnes dents.
C'est un plastiqueur ŗ coup sŻr.
Sans emploi, mŤre dominatrice,
atelier au sous-sol,
- comportement asocial...
- Pas sŻr.
ll a ťcrit 253 lettres
ŗ la mairie.
S'il posait des bombes,
la correspondance aurait cessť.
ll a dit quoi ?
''Mťcrťants'' !
Personne ne dit Áa ŗ part lui...
Et le Faxeur.
Coffrons-le
avant qu'il ne recommence.
Une photographe

Vous pouvez arrÍter de compter.
Vous Ítes entrť dans la piŤce.
ll y a 11 pas jusqu'ŗ la porte.
TrŤs bien.
C'est drŰle,
je dťtestais les maths ŗ l'ťcole.
Et ma vie
repose sur l'arithmťtique.
9 pas du lit ŗ la salle de bains,
14 pas jusqu'au couloir,
7 pas jusqu'ŗ la chaise...
Heureusement,
pas de divisions !
ll fait beau. Si on sortait ?
Non, je prťfŤre rester ici.
Rachel...
il faudra bien sortir.
Je devais
travailler au studio,
mais il faisait beau, je suis
montťe sur le toit de la mairie.
C'est ma derniŤre sortie.
Vous ťtiez au mauvais endroit,
au mauvais moment.
Ce n'est pas votre faute.
Ne cessez pas de vivre pour Áa.
ll a encore posť une bombe.
C'est exact.
Mais il n'y a eu aucun blessť.
Quand je regardais
dans l'objectif,
je voyais des choses invisibles.
Sur mille photos, je savais
d'avance laquelle ťtait bonne.
Je me souviens
de presque toutes mes photos.
C'est ironique.
On dit qu'il ťtait lŗ.
Alors, j'ai dŻ le voir
en train de poser la bombe.
Mais j'ai beau essayer...
je ne m'en souviens pas.
Dire qu'ils pensent
que l'un de nous
collabore avec Jarod !
J'aurais pas dŻ manger
ce g‚teau au pavot.
On passe
au dťtecteur de mensonges,
c'est pas une analyse d'urine !
Je m'attendais aux deux.
Pour vous, il faudrait !
Ce qui signifie ?
Vous gťrez les informations.
Pardon.
Ne nous accusons pas entre nous.
Ca en dit long,
venant du nounours de Jarod !
Pour ťtalonner l'appareil,
rťpondez-moi en mentant.
Etes-vous Eleanor Roosevelt ?
Avez-vous traquť Jarod
de votre mieux ?
Deviens elle, Angelo.
Dis-moi si elle ment.
Avez-vous volontairement
mal visť
en tirant sur Jarod ŗ Miami ?
- Comment ?
- Oui ou non.
ll est interdit de fumer
pendant le test.
Avez-vous reÁu
un message personnel de Jarod ?
C'ťtait une blague.
Oui.
Avez-vous contactť Jarod
en secret par lnternet ?
Oui.
Avez-vous tentť
de lui donner des informations ?
Oui, mais dans le but
de le faire revenir.
Avez-vous dťjŗ rencontrť Jarod
en secret ?
Non.
ll ment ?
C'est lui ?
Avez-vous dťjŗ consommť
une substance illťgale ?
Etiez-vous dans le labo
lors de la fuite d'informations ?
Oui.
Avez-vous envoyť un message
ŗ Jarod
par coursier ŗ Miami ?
Avez-vous dťjŗ menti au Centre ?
C'est la fuite,
n'est-ce pas, Angelo ?
Vous vous orientez
vers l'autopsie ?
J'ai examinť tous les dťbris.
Vous avez ťtudiť 3 000 morceaux ?
3 025.
J'ai surtout examinť les fils.
Les flics
ont analysť chaque centimŤtre...
Je sais.
J'ai ťtudiť les branchements.
Ce type
n'a pas de schťma particulier,
sauf pour connecter
le dťtonateur.
ll est pointilleux lŗ-dessus.
ll veut Ítre sŻr de son coup.
lls sont tous coupťs
de la mÍme faCon.
Exactement la mÍme ?
Exactement.
Regardez cet angle.
On peut consulter
les fabriquants de couteaux.
- D'aprŤs les contours...
- ll est droitier.
En effet.
Simple ?
TrŤs.
Comment va la patate
aux mille visages ?
Je n'ai que 13 piŤces...
- Techniquement, Áa fait...
- 179.
J'ai une mission pour vous.
Je suis dťbordť.
Ca me tient vraiment ŗ coeur.
C'est ma mŤre.
Vous pouvez la vieillir
de 30 ans ?
Je veux voir
comment elle serait.
- Vous serez rťcompensť.
- J'essaierai !
Elle est sous le bus.
- Sous le bus !
- Vous avez reÁu un fax ?
Un coup de fil.
Un chauffeur
a trouvť la valise
dans le bus de 15 h 15.
On s'en occupe.
Vous pouvez vous dťpÍcher ?
J'ai des bus qui attendent...
Prenez tout votre temps.
Ca va ?
Tu as mal au dos ?
Je savais
qu'il y avait des canulars,
mais je m'attendais pas ŗ Áa.
N'y pense plus.
Facile ŗ dire.
C'ťtait pas ťvident.
T'en fais pas.
Beau travail.
Ca date de l'armťe.
Tu ťtais soŻl ?
Raide ! Toute mon unitť.
AprŤs la Grenade,
on est partis ŗ Porto Rico.
J'ai aucun souvenir de ce mois,
sauf le tatoueur.
Un Portoricain ratatinť
dans une boutique de San Juan.
ll a tatouť
tout le rťgiment.
Vous savez combien d'aigles
il a fait ? Assez !
En faisant ťquipe avec lui,
on connaÓt son rťgiment par coeur.
Que faites-vous ?
Je prťpare une chambre noire.
Je vis dans une chambre noire.
Tant mieux,
j'ai besoin que vous dťveloppiez
une pellicule.
Cette odeur est familiŤre...
Je le savais.
C'est une nouvelle thťrapie ?
Disons une simulation.
Je vais crťer un environnement
afin que vous puissiez recrťer
un ťvťnement...
et devenir quelqu'un.
Je dois devenir qui ?
Vous-mÍme.
Mon appareil !
Je n'y ai pas touchť depuis le...
depuis ce jour-lŗ
ŗ la mairie.
Dťveloppez cette pellicule,
les photos prises ce jour-lŗ.
- ll n'y a pas de pellicule.
- Je sais.
Dťveloppez les photos
dans votre tÍte.
Je suis sur le toit
de la mairie.
La lumiŤre naturelle
est parfaite.
Le b‚timent est fermť.
C'est dimanche.
Je fais les derniŤres photos
pour mon vernissage.
Seule ?
Je crois. Je ne vois personne.
Je ne vois personne,
mais je sens
comme un frisson sur la nuque.
Je ne vois personne,
mais j'entends quelque chose.
Qu'entendez-vous ?
Des pas...
qui s'ťloignent vite.
Vous laissez tomber,
vous avez des photos ŗ faire.
C'est juste avant que Áa n'arrive.
Vous voulez qu'on arrÍte ?
Je me dirige vers l'endroit
d'oý viennent les pas,
mais il est parti.
Vous voyez la bombe ?
Un seul instant avant le flash.
Vous le voyez ?
Je sens quelque chose.
Son odeur.
Ca doit Ítre...
Je ne sais pas trop...
De l'eau de toilette.
Non, c'est pharmaceutique.
Du menthol...
Pour les douleurs musculaires.
Pour chauffer.
Merci.
Stephen Johnson ?
Agent Jarod webster.
Le FBl !
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
Rien. Je me renseigne
sur un de vos copains d'armťe,
Daniel Carlson.
ll vous a citť.
C'est pas moi qui le blanchirai.
- Pourquoi ?
- ll parle beaucoup,
mais on a dŻ le porter
sans cesse.
Selon lui,
le rťgiment ťtait trŤs uni.
On lui aurait tirť dessus
s'il n'avait pas reÁu cet ťclat.
ll a le tatouage du rťgiment.
Vous voyez un oiseau dťbile
sur moi ?
Un jour, Carlson est revenu soŻl
avec un oiseau sur le bras.
ll voulait qu'on fasse pareil.
C'est un dťtraquť.
Merci de votre aide.
Que veut faire cette fouine ?
Du dťsamorÁage.
Dieu nous garde !
- Vous m'avez appelť ?
- Papa NoŽl a eu du retard.
Mais...
Elle est toujours belle.
Vous deviez me rťcompenser.
Patience, M. TÍte de Patate.
- Merci.
- Pas de quoi.
Le Faxeur
s'est fait sauter tout seul.
- Oý est Carlson ?
- C'est lui qui a appelť.
Laissez-moi !
Laissez-la passer, c'est son fils.
Ca va ?
Je n'ťtais pas lŗ,
j'avais un rendez-vous.
Maman est lŗ.
Je suis revenu l'interroger.
ll m'a vu et a tout fait sauter.
Ca m'a envoyť
au bout de l'allťe.
Bien jouť, Carlson.
Allez vous dťbarbouiller.
J'aurais dŻ m'en douter.
Encore un croissant ?
Le cafť froid me suffit.
ll semblait toujours avoir
une longueur d'avance, mais
on avait une longueur de retard.
Broots n'a pas du tout
une personnalitť conflictuelle.
Je ne le vois pas
prendre de risques.
Oý il va, maintenant ?
Un dťtective privť ?
ll aurait retrouvť Jarod ?
Je ne sais pas.
Mais quelqu'un vient
de prendre des risques.
Ca n'a pas de sens.
Un plastiqueur intelligent
qui ne laissait aucune trace
fait sauter
accidentellement sa maison ?
Ne commencez pas !
Pourquoi aurait-il gardť
son matťriel dans le garage ?
ll sentait peut-Ítre
le vent tourner.
C'est pas lui.
Pourquoi ? ll est gaucher ?
Effectivement.
Aux jurťs de dťcider
s'il est coupable.
Nous, on rassemble les preuves.
Nous avons en exclusivitť
l'agent Carlson.
Vous avez dťsamorcť la bombe.
Qu'est-ce que vous ťprouvez ?
Je suis heureux
que ce cauchemar soit fini.
Pas tout ŗ fait.
lci.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites lŗ ?
Des nettoyeurs chez moi ?
C'est rien, ma chťrie...
ll se bat pour la garde.
Le dťtective cherchait
des preuves contre son ex.
- Le billet d'avion ?
- Suzy doit rentrer chez maman.
Au moins, il est blanchi.
Comment Áa ?
ll a menti au Centre.
ll n'a pas dit
qu'il ťtait mariť.
ll voulait garder sa vie privťe.
On a eu tort.
Exact !
Vous Ítes en retard.
J'ťtais au tťlťphone avec
l'avocat. ll abandonne l'affaire.
J'en suis navrťe.
Vraiment, Mlle Parker ?
Gr‚ce ŗ vous,
ma fille a pleurť toute la nuit.
Demain, elle repart chez sa mŤre,
contre son grť.
Cela n'a rien ŗ voir
avec le Centre.
Je travaille ici.
J'ai vendu mon ‚me
ŗ cet endroit, pas la sienne.
Ne lui faites pas d'ennuis
et ne me faites pas d'ennuis.
Lamont,
vous faites quoi, ce soir ?
Attrape-moi, mťcrťant
Ascenseur direct, tour Chelsea
Jette un oeil lŗ-dessus.
C'est bidon.
Le Faxeur est ŗ l'hŰpital.
ll a dŻ s'ťchapper.
Allons-y.
- Les ascenseurs ?
- Par lŗ.
Attendons les renforts.
On peut devenir des hťros !
Encore une Betty Butťe.
Ne nous prťcipitons pas.
Regarde,
il a laissť un mot.
Doucement...
''Cette fois,
c'est pour de bon !''
Laisse tomber.
Le direct
fait 60 ťtages sans s'arrÍter.
Si on a de la chance.
Quoi ?
Dťtonateur baromťtrique,
fait pour se dťclencher
ŗ 200 m d'altitude.
On peut arriver ŗ 50 ťtages,
maximum.
Tirons-nous !
ll faut la dťsamorcer.
- On a pas le temps.
- Mais si !
C'est facile pour toi.
C'est comme les bombes
que tu faisais.
Celles que tu dťsamorÁais
pour Ítre un hťros
comme ton frŤre.
Qui tu es ?
Rien qu'un mťcrťant ordinaire
qui pense que
Rachel Newton a perdu la vue
ŗ cause de toi.
Je ne voulais
faire de mal ŗ personne !
Dis Áa ŗ Curtis Haring,
celui que tu as fait sauter
pour brouiller les pistes.
Assez ! Dťsamorce-la !
Tu es moins dťtendu
qu'avec tes bombes.
Mais ceux qui posent des bombes
sont des l‚ches.
Comme j'ai posť celle-lŗ,
je veux pas la voir exploser.

Elle a mis 30 mn ŗ descendre,

ll faudra
enlever le corps samedi ?
Juste après le lever du jour.
Tous les détails sont là :
choix du cercueil, cimetière...
Je préférerais...
une cérémonie discrète.
Le défunt était votre père ?
Est mon père.
Si votre père vit toujours...
Que le cercueil soit prêt samedi.
Jessica Will plaide
la cause de son père
Carl Will proclame son innocence
Je ne veux pas mourir.
Je sais qu'il est trop tard.
Tu n'as rien à avouer ?
Vous me demandez la vérité.
Je vous l'ai toujours donnée.
Même au seuil de la mort,
tu proclames ton innocence ?
ll est innocent.
Un innocent va mourir.
Descendez du bus, vite !
Vous entendez ? Côte à côte !
En rang et en silence !
Plus vite que ça !
Bienvenue à la prison d'Oakfield.
Comptez-vous !
Rien de plus sur la prochaine
destination de Jarod.
''Cabine téléphonique du Top Hat,
'Week-end du 15 janvier,
rendez-vous avec le Cow-boy
''au sujet des frères Parker.''
Je n'ai pas de frère,
n'est-ce pas ?
Je l'ignore.
Mais le week-end prochain,
ce sera le 15
et c'est l'écriture de Jarod.
La femme de ménage a trouvé ça ?
Dans le dernier repaire
de Jarod,
dans l'évacuation des w-C.
La chasse avait été tirée.
Tous les détails sont réglés.
Continuez, Broots.
Quels détails ?
- M. Broots vient aussi.
- La directrice pense
qu'il faut une aide technique.
Une aide technique ?
Elle pense
que certains points sont négligés
et que Sydney et vous
êtes trop liés à Jarod
au niveau affectif.
Et vous êtes la solution ?
Disons un regard objectif.
Je vais chercher la voiture.
Plus ennuyeux
que la saison de hockey.
M. Bradley, ici,
on est sans cesse confrontés
au désespoir.
Un désespoir lié
à l'enfermement dans une cellule
pendant 20 ou 30 ans,
voire plus.
Désespoir
est le mot qui convient.
Quand un homme a du tempérament,
ça dégénère vite.
Votre boulot, c'est d'éviter ça.
Vous êtes ici
pour votre expérience.
Samedi, l'exécution de Carl will
promet d'être délicate.
ll a tous les symptômes
d'un criminel de carrière.
Carl will a un casier
depuis 30 ans.
Vol de voiture, braquage,
une douzaine d'autres délits,
jusqu'au meurtre
d'un détenu.
Vous avez connu
l'émeute de Folsom ?
Je suis fier de dire
qu'elle a été réprimée.
On ne mouche pas de nez,
on ne pleure pas
sur notre épaule.
On se débrouille pour réprimer,
comme vous dites, M. Bradley.
L'exécution enverra sûrement
un message à tous les détenus.
C'est voulu.
ll n'est pas là
et aucun habitué ne l'a vu.
On devrait le surveiller.
Vous n'avez pas d'arme, dites ?
Et où installeriez-vous
le poste de surveillance ?
Là.
ll y a combien de surveillants
à Folsom ?
35 en semaine,
un peu moins le week-end.
Harper est un directeur sévère.
ll s'appelle Hopkins.
- C'est ça.
- Morris !
Jarod Bradley, Tommy Larsen.
Le type de Folsom !
En personne !
Tommy va vous faire visiter.
Soyez vigilant,
les animaux s'agitent.
Je vais vous montrer la cour.
La plupart des détenus
y passent 5 h par jour.
Le zoo change, la routine reste.
On veille
à ce qu'ils ne s'entre-tuent pas.
Ca a l'air tendu.
Tout se calmera après...
l'événement.
L'événement ?
L'exécution.
Vous verrez ça de près.
Le nouveau s'occupe du mort.
- Pourquoi moi ?
- Comme à Folsom,
on trouve que ça porte malheur
de trop approcher un condamné.
On laisse ça au nouveau.
C'est lui ?
Comment ?
C'est l'homme qu'on va tuer ?
C'est lui.
Comment ça, c'est complet ?
Qui aurait envie de descendre
au Park Place Motel ?
ll y a un congrès. Une compagnie
d'électricité a tout réservé.
- Vous le connaissez ?
- Jarod ?
ll vient de temps en temps.
ll doit passer ce week-end,
il a un rendez-vous.
Puisque vous êtes ses amis,
votre frère et vous,
et votre père,
dormirez
dans la chambre de luxe
que je réserve aux vedettes.
La chambre de luxe ?
Burl lves y a dormi,
et même Mama Cass.
Sans parler d'Osmond,
celui qui a l'air idiot,
avec de grandes oreilles.
Je parie que c'était pas Donny.
Courrier pour le détenu Cockran ?
Pardon, je ne regardais pas
où j'allais.
Ca va, chef ?
Oui, et je m'appelle Jarod.
Vous êtes ?
Cockran Henry.
Enchanté, Henry.
- Vous êtes nouveau.
- En effet.
Et vous ?
J'arpente ces couloirs
depuis 27 ans.
C'est long.
ll n'y a pas un cafard
que je ne tutoie pas !
- Des nouvelles de chez vous ?
- Ma femme.
Elle n'oublie jamais de m'écrire.
Elle m'envoie des graines
pour mon jardin.
Ce doit être des soucis.
Vous n'avez rien à faire ?
La cuisine, chef.
On appelle ça répression
à Folsom ?
ll faut connaître son ennemi.
Voici une histoire
d'amour et de loi
entre un condamné à mort
et sa fille qui se bat pour lui.
ll y a 10 ans,
Carl Will est condamné
à 5 ans de prison
pour vol de voiture.
Peu avant sa libération,
il est mêlé à une rixe
à la prison d'Oakfield au cours
de laquelle un détenu est tué.
Après un procès rapide
mené par l'actuel gouverneur,
alors procureur,
Will est condamné à mort
pour meurtre avec préméditation.
L'histoire prend alors
un tour étrange.
Lors de sa 1re arrestation,
sa fille était étudiante.
Elle croit suffisamment
en son père
pour étudier le droit
et se battre
pour sa libération.
Mais le gouverneur
rejetant son appel
et l'exécution étant fixée
à vendredi,
cette odyssée de loi et d'amour
semble toucher à sa fin.
J'aime mon père
et je ne renoncerai jamais
à me battre.
Que pensez-vous de la demande
de grâce de Mlle will ?
Seul compte
le refus du gouverneur.
Mlle will y voit
un acte politique de celui-ci
dans le but d'être réélu.
Qu'en dites-vous ?
Mlle will aime son père,
mais les faits
l'emportent sur l'émotion.
De quels faits parlez-vous ?
Les agents Clancy et Larsen
ont trouvé Carl will
près de la victime,
l'arme du crime à la main.
Hélas,
ces choses arrivent
entre transgresseurs.
Mais nous ne les tolérerons pas.
Nous ferons notre travail
samedi à l'aube.
Ca porte malheur
d'approcher un condamné !
Je suis nouveau.
Je n'ai pas le choix.
J'ai pas faim.
C'est un chateaubriand à point
avec des haricots.
J'ai choisi ça
comme dernier repas.
Je sais.
Je croyais
que c'était dans deux jours.
C'est ce que vous préférez.
Pourquoi attendre ?
lls avancent vers vous, non ?
Les murs...
On les fixe assez longtemps
pour les voir approcher.
Vous semblez avoir été
derrière les barreaux.
C'est dur...
quand on n'est pas à sa place.
Vous êtes innocent.
Du moins,
c'est ce que vous dites.
Personne n'écoute.
Moi, si.
Vous voulez dire
qu'un surveillant
ne connaît pas cette histoire ?
Je l'ai entendue.
Je m'intéresse à la vérité.
On m'a ramené au bloc C
depuis la blanchisserie.
J'ai entendu des voix,
des gens qui se battaient.
J'ai voulu voir
ce qui se passait,
on m'a assommé.
Je me suis réveillé
dans ce cauchemar.
Pain de maïs ou beignets ?
Des beignets,
comme vous l'aviez demandé.
Comme Jessica l'a demandé.
C'est elle qui a tout réglé.
Elle vous aime beaucoup.
Le prisonnier est servi.
Tu me manques tellement !
Je souffre en pensant
combien tu étais belle
dans ton bain,
avec les bulles
qui dansaient sur ton corps.
Puis tu t'es levée et j'ai vu
ton superbe...
L'écoute téléphonique fonctionne.
Je vais fouiller la chambre
en quête de traces de Jarod.
Je vais devenir folle.
Prenez un de mes livres
si vous voulez.
La Pensée relative,
L'Esprit intérieur.
Bon sang, Sydney,
vous ne pensez donc qu'à Jarod ?
Pas vous ?
ll n'y a pas que Jarod
dans la vie.
Par exemple ?
Le plaisir.
Le sexe.
C'est drôle, vous évoquez le sexe
alors qu'on parle de Jarod.
Rien dans les toilettes.
A quand remonte
votre dernière liaison ?
La vie privée de Sydney
ne s'évoque pas en public.
C'est malsain,
toute cette énergie animale
contenue.
Vous allez finir assassin !
Je vois une femme.
Vraiment ?
Parlez-nous d'elle.
On s'est rencontrés par lnternet.
Vous draguez par ordinateur ?
Comme c'est romantique !
Des détails.
Elle est comptable.
Elle a trois chiens
et un oiseau.
Et elle est fan de John Tesh.
Une vraie tigresse !
Elle est jolie ?
Je vais commencer
à chercher des empreintes.
On ne s'est pas vus...
pas encore.
Vous êtes lamentable !
ll ne pourrait pas faire
plus chaud ?
Ca va, Mlle Parker ?
C'est la pâtée qu'on a mangée
dans cette gargote !
Que peut-il se passer
de palpitant ?
Regardez ! Un Monopoly !
C'est fou,
les gens qu'on accepte ici.
Tu sens rien ?
Ca sent le grillé...
Vous ne pourriez pas
me laisser tranquille ?
Et si je veux pas ?
Tu vas faire comme ton père
et me poignarder ?
Salut, chérie, je suis en retard.
Quel embouteillage !
Vous pouvez nous laisser,
messieurs ?
Ca doit vous arriver souvent.
Vous n'imaginez pas !
Vous êtes surveillant
à la prison.
- Je suis en congé.
- Ne le prenez pas mal,
mais je ne tiens pas à manger
avec des surveillants.
Je viens de voir votre père.
Vous lui manquez beaucoup.
Qu'est-ce qui vous amène ici ?
Le destin.
Votre père ne mérite pas le sien.
Ma mère m'a quittée très jeune.
Lui ne m'a jamais quittée.
On a longtemps vécu
dans une caravane rouillée.
On était pauvres,
mais je ne manquais de rien.
Mon père
n'est pas la vertu incarnée.
ll a fait des folies
dans sa jeunesse.
Mais entre voler des voitures
et commettre un meurtre,
il y a un fossé.
ll a passé 5 ans
derrière les barreaux.
ll allait être libéré.
Dehors, il avait du travail
et il y avait moi.
ll ne m'aurait pas fait ça.
Le Monopoly a été créé
par Charles Darrow,
un ingénieur au chômage
de Germantown en 1935.
C'est fascinant.
Le jeu a d'abord été refusé
à cause de 52 erreurs.
Mais 100 millions d'exemplaires
ont été vendus.
Vous semblez expert
en la matière.
Club Monopoly au lycée.
Quelle surprise !
Ca va ?
ll fait trop chaud, c'est tout !
Quelque chose cloche
dans ce jeu.
Quelque chose cloche
dans tout ça !
ll manque quelque chose.
Ce qui manque, c'est Jarod !
Appelez un médecin !
Le détenu Lewis tué à Oakfield
Mort d'un détenu lors d'une rixe
Un détenu meurt dans un incendie
Le directeur de la prison
parle de la sécurité
Des narcisses ?
J'appelle ça des jonquilles.
Les préférées de ma femme.
Je la comprends,
elles sont splendides.
Personne ne vous prendra
au sérieux.
La seule chose
qui pousse ici,
c'est le ressentiment.
C'est toujours si tendu
avant une exécution ?
Toujours.
Vous connaissiez Anthony Lewis ?
Non, il était arrivé
deux jours auparavant.
Deux jours !
Ca laisse peu de temps à will
pour le haïr au point de le tuer.
ll se passe des choses étranges.
Comme les autres détenus
qui sont morts ici ?
Sept au cours
des cinq dernières années.
Rien que des accidents.
Ca dépasse la moyenne nationale.
Je ne sais rien à ce sujet.
Allons, Henry, vous tutoyez
tous les cafards par ici.
Qu'est-il arrivé à Lewis
et aux autres détenus morts ?
En prison, on baisse la tête
et on se tait.
Surtout ici.
Avec ce directeur.
Rentrez !
J'ai deux minutes à vivre.
J'ai la bouche sèche.
Je suis calme...
mais j'ai peur.
Je sens battre mon coeur
dans mes oreilles.
Dis la vérité.
C'est fait.
C'est ta dernière chance.
J'ai dit la vérité.
Tu vas mourir.
Purifie ta conscience.
Elle est pure.
Je suis en paix.
Rosenberg disait vrai.
ll n'a pas trahi de secrets.
Tu en es sûr ?
Oui. Pas vous ?
Mais si on le savait innocent,
pour l'a-t-on exécuté ?
A ton avis ?
Parce qu'il fallait un coupable.
Serrez bien.
Je ne veux pas
que le détenu se détache.
Lancez le processus.
Faites descendre les pastilles.
Pourquoi cette hésitation ?
Mauvaise communication.
Le spectacle se déroulera bien.
Veillez-y,
parce que la presse sera là,
je ne veux pas devoir
tuer will deux fois.
Faites-le sortir.
Vous savez ce que j'ai ?
Je crois que c'est un ulcère.
Vu la façon dont vous étiez pliée
en deux, il est costaud.
Que peut-on faire ?
Je vais prescrire
un antiacide léger.
J'ignore si ce sera efficace,
étant donné qu'elle fume
et mène une vie
anormalement stressante.
Vous pouvez le dire !
J'ignore ce que vous faites,
mais ça vous ronge
de l'intérieur.
ll va falloir changer
de mode de vie,
- Sinon...
- Sinon quoi ?
Vous pourriez en mourir.
Apprenez donc
à maîtriser vos émotions
comme votre père.
Bonne soirée.
ll a raison.
Si vous ne contrôlez pas
vos sentiments envers Jarod,
vous êtes en danger.
C'est un peu tard
pour s'inquiéter de ça.
Clancy !
Nettoyez-moi ça.
Qu'ils rentrent dans leur cage !
Recommence
et tu finiras sous terre !
Je voulais protéger mes fleurs.
La question ne se posera plus !
- Ca va ?
- Oui, bien sûr.
C'est sûr ?
Je ne comprends pas.
- Si ces lettres sont fausses...
- Où est ma femme ?
Elle est morte il y a 3 ans...
d'un cancer.
Désolé.
C'est pitoyable.
On enferme un homme
assez longtemps,
ça le tord.
Jusqu'à ce qu'il craque.
Rita et moi,
on a été mariés 43 ans.
Vous ne le saviez pas, hein ?
En effet.
J'ai enfreint la loi
et je le paie chaque jour
depuis 27 ans.
Mais il y a certaines choses
qu'on ne peut pas
se voir enlever.
La fierté, la dignité.
Je comprends les règles,
mais ce que m'a fait le directeur
est injuste.
Je voulais seulement être là
pour l'enterrement de ma Rita.
Elle a beaucoup souffert
à cause de moi.
Je voulais seulement
pouvoir fleurir sa tombe
et la sentir dans mon coeur,
une dernière fois.
ll m'a refusé la permission.
On laisse sortir des détenus
chaque jour pour ça.
Tout ce que je voulais,
c'était lui dire adieu.
Vous cultivez ce jardin pour ça ?
C'est fou, hein ?
Je continue à prier
pour qu'un jour je puisse
montrer combien je l'aime.
Mais Michaels a décidé
de faire un exemple
de cet endroit.
C'est ma façon de m'exprimer.
Je ne voulais pas qu'ils croient
m'avoir fait craquer.
- Mon garçon !
- Attends !
J'espère ne pas vous déranger.
J'ai apporté des jouets
à vos enfants.
J'arrive tout de suite.
Vous avez une belle famille.
Vous avez de la chance.
Quelque chose vous tracasse ?
Carl will.
Comment ça ?
Ca m'ennuie de l'avouer, mais...
je ne peux pas assumer
l'exécution.
Je n'ai jamais vu
quelqu'un mourir.
J'espérais que vous m'aideriez.
ll y a erreur sur la personne.
Je vous ai vu
pendant la répétition.
Vous aviez du mal à imaginer
Carl will attaché au fauteuil,
le gaz se répandant
et l'étouffant jusqu'à la mort.
Pourquoi ?
C'est comme ça.
Vous avez remarqué ?
C'est comme la culpabilité.
On peut la déplacer
d'un endroit à l'autre,
ça revient toujours en place.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Quelqu'un qui ne veut pas
la mort d'un innocent,
qui pense que Jessica
mérite d'avoir son père
autant que ces enfants
méritent d'avoir le leur.
Je fais ce boulot depuis 20 ans.
C'est tout ce que je connais.
ll est trop tard
pour recommencer.
Je ne peux pas m'opposer
à quelqu'un comme Clancy.
- Vous avez peur de mourir ?
- Soyez prudent.
Vous savez comment ça se passe
en prison.
Pas question que je finisse
comme Lewis et les autres.
Lewis arrivait de Joliet.
Comme les autres morts.
J'ai étudié leurs dossiers.
C'est intéressant.
lls appartenaient tous
au même gang de Chicago.
Je crois que quelqu'un a payé
pour qu'ils se taisent.
C'est ce qui s'est passé ?
Le beau-frère de Clancy
est gratte-papier à Joliet.
ll est payé par un gang rival
pour transférer les cibles ici.
Clancy fait le boulot,
ils partagent l'argent.
Vous êtes des leurs ?
Pas du tout.
Je n'ai rien su
avant la mort de Lewis
et là, c'était trop tard.
Et Carl will ?
Clancy achevait Lewis
quand will est arrivé.
Je devais surveiller les lieux.
Je pensais qu'il le frappait
pour du fric.
- Et vous l'avez assommé ?
- ll le fallait.
Clancy l'aurait tué.
Clancy lui a mis
un coup de couteau.
Quand will est revenu à lui,
c'était fini.
Et voilà qu'il va mourir...
pour quelque chose
qu'il n'a pas fait.
Quelque chose cloche dans ce jeu.
ll manque peut-être des éléments.
Oui, mais il y a autre chose.
Je crois que quelque chose
d'important nous échappe.
Parlez pour vous.
Voilà un cow-boy.
Un geste et je vous descends.
Du calme, ma jolie,
je ne suis que le messager.
Raccrochez et tournez-vous.
Doucement.
Quel gros revolver
pour une si jolie dame.
Gardez Ca pour la fête du village.
Que faites-vous là ?
On m'a payé
pour faire une livraison.
Quel genre de livraison ?
Je ne suis pas armé. Juré !
Seulement la main gauche.
Je savais
qu'il manquait quelque chose.
Qu'est-ce que vous dites ?
Le jeu. Chance !
''Vous êtes libéré de prison.''
Qu'est-ce que ça signifie ?
Bon sang !
Montrez-moi votre registre.
Jarod Short, Jarod St. James,
Jarod Ventor, Jarod Chance,
Marvin Gardens, chambre 5.
La chambre voisine de la nôtre.
''Allez directement en prison,
''ne passez pas par la case départ,
ne recevez pas 20 000 F.''
J'en ai marre d'être un pion
dans son jeu.
''Allez directement en prison.''
Bon sang, Jarod !
Libérez Carl will !
Le directeur vient d'appeler.
ll veut que vous vérifiez
la chambre à gaz.
J'ai mis le cyanure
il y a une heure.
ll y a un problème d'électricité.
- Envoyez Larsen.
- Sa femme a appelé.
ll est malade.
ll a la trouille, oui !
Allez-y.
lmpossible, je suis nouveau.
Je dois servir
le dernier repas de will.
Bon, ça va !
Si on veut
qu'une chose soit faite...
On la fait soi-même.
Heureusement,
c'est pas la chaise électrique.
M. le directeur ?
Qui a fermé la porte ?
Qui est là ?
C'est effrayant, non ?
Etre enfermé
comme un animal sauvage...
Attendre la mort.
Très drôle. Laissez-moi sortir.
Je ne crois pas.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
La même chose que vous.
Je ne comprends pas.
Allons, Clancy !
Je sais que vous avez tué Lewis.
Vous avez accusé Carl Will.
Comment laisser mourir
un innocent
pour un acte
que vous avez commis ?
Vous êtes qui ?
Je suis vous...
Juge...
jury...
et bourreau.
Combien d'hommes ?
Combien d'hommes avez-vous tués ?
Cinq ?
Six ?
C'étaient des animaux.
- J'ai aidé la société.
- Vous auriez réussi,
si Carl Will n'avait pas été là
au mauvais moment.
Dites votre prix.
Mon prix ?
L'argent...
Combien vaut la vie
d'un être humain ?
Combien avez-vous gagné ?
5 000 ?
10 000 par tête ?
Je crois qu'il est temps
que la justice triomphe.
Vous avez droit
à une dernière volonté,
mais à vrai dire,
vous ne le méritez pas.
Le spectacle va commencer.
Cacher à cet homme
que les pastilles de cyanure
sont factices,
ça n'est pas cruel ?
Je serais ravie de répondre
à toutes vos questions,
mais je veux d'abord embrasser
mon père, lui dire que je l'aime.
Poussez-vous !
Ouvrez, on nous attend.
Aucun être civilisé ne peut dire
qu'il aime ordonner de lâcher
les pastilles de cyanure
dans l'acide...
de tuer quelqu'un. On fait ça
pour dissuader les criminels.
Mais il s'avère que la corruption
règne parmi le personnel.
Par conséquent,
des changements auront lieu
pour le bien de chaque détenu.
Ma démission
prendra effet dans 24 h,
après mon dernier geste
de directeur.
Apparemment,
vous aimez les jeux, monsieur...
Parker. Oui.
J'en ai inventé un
qui s'appelle :
''Vous êtes libéré de prison''.
Adaptation

Sous-titrage
NlCE FELLOw
Vu dans Le Caméléon :
Je sais la vérité.
De quelle vérité s'agit-il ?
La vérité sur qui te rend triste.
- Votre mère était formidable.
- Elle était faible.
Ce qui me tracasse, c'est :
pourquoi dans un ascenseur ?
Votre mère était extraordinaire.
D'un côté, je la connaissais
mieux que personne.
Mais elle gardait
une part secrète.
C'est tout ce que tu fais ?
Déterrer le passé ?
Facile à dire, tu en as un.
Maman !
lls vont lui faire mal !
Quoi ?
On a une piste.
Jarod est le meilleur
des rats d'égout.
Personne ne s'intéresse autant
aux excréments !
Un vrai fan
des matières fécales !
C'est charmant !
- ll est resté longtemps ?
- 15 jours.
Ca lui a suffi pour comprendre.
- Quoi ?
- On creusait dans une nappe.
Si on l'avait touchée, l'eau
aurait entraîné 45 égoutiers
dans les oubliettes.
Comme les Egyptiens
dans Les Dix commandements.
Jarod se prend pour Moïse !
Moïse ?
Charlton Heston.
- Jarod a émergé ici ?
- Exactement.
ll n'a pas dit pourquoi.
ll voulait prendre le large.
Commandant Forrester,
il y a un problème.
Au rapport.
Sous-marin en vue.
ll se rapproche.
C'est peut-être notre cible.
Détendez-vous,
Ca va devenir drôle.
Pourquoi ça tombe sur moi ?
Prévenez le capitaine.
ll y a de la bataille dans l'air.
Garde-à-vous !
Capitaine Nagel, commandant
Nashton. C'est le Rostov.
Après son départ d'Odessa,
le capitaine s'est séparé
de la flotte de la mer Noire.
- ll est seul...
- Avec plein de têtes nucléaires.
D'après le dossier,
sa première cible
est Los Angeles.
Les écoutilles sont ouvertes.
lls sont prêts à tirer
dans 2 minutes.
Torpilles à l'eau.
Préparez la torpille leurre.
Torpille prête.
- ll y a un problème.
- Lequel ?
On a perdu le signal du leurre !
Une torpille !
Les torpilles sont à 300 mètres.
Toujours pas de signal !
- 200 mètres !
- Lancement dans 90 secondes.
Allez, Baker !
J'ai le leurre !
La torpille numéro 2 se rapproche.
Raté !
Le Rostov va recommencer.
Les ogives partent
dans une minute.
40l à tribord.
Maintenez le cap !
0-9-0.
Envoyons les deux torpilles.
Envoyons-en une maintenant,
puis on virera à tribord
et on lancera la 2e.
- Pourquoi ?
- Envoyez la 1re torpille.
A vos ordres.
Torpille lancée.
Tête nucléaire dans 30 secondes.
Virez de 30l à tribord.
Maintenez le cap, 1 -2-0.
Raté.
Envoyez la 2e !
Torpille lancée.
Tête nucléaire !
Ca chauffe !
Tête nucléaire dans 10 secondes.
Dans le mille !
lls coulent !
lci le capitaine Drucker.
Vous nous avez eus,
sales Amerloques !
C'est un plaisir de faire
une simulation avec vous.
On manque de guerres froides !
Ne riez pas.
Trois secondes de plus,
Los Angeles brûlait.
Bien joué, Baker.
Commandant Forrester,
cette équipe laisse à désirer.
Le Monroe est comme une chaîne.
Si un des maillons cède...
on frise la catastrophe.
Dans une semaine,
on prend le large.
ll est impératif
d'améliorer
vos temps de réaction.
Après notre dernière mission,
je veux que ça tourne
comme une montre suisse.
Compris ?
Votre jour de congé
est transformé
en séjour en enfer.
C'est un séjour en enfer,
on adore ça !
On y prend plaisir ?
Allez, vous adorez ça !
Je n'entends pas !
Je voulais pas
de jour de congé, et toi ?
Tu n'assumes pas les problèmes ?
Si la mission tourne mal,
ne recommence pas
comme avec Seaver !
Seaver était un imbécile.
Séparez-vous ! Debout !
Knox, Marcus !
Baker, vous êtes le plus gradé.
Si ça se reproduit,
je vous envoie au trou !
- Compris ?
- Oui, mon commandant.
Vous avez très bien réagi.
Comme ce matin, à la manoeuvre.
Désolé,
je ne voulais pas intervenir.
Mais si.
Vous avez eu de la chance.
Je suppose.
Nagel était assez tendu.
C'est le défaut de sa cuirasse.
On a perdu un homme
à cause d'une fuite de gaz.
- Une fuite de gaz ?
- Oui, du JX-5.
- Tout aurait pu sauter.
- Ne m'en parlez pas.
J'étais sur le pont.
Je ne voudrais pas
que ça se reproduise.
Dites-moi,
vous saviez
ce que ferait le Harrison ?
C'est la technique
de prédilection de Ted Drucker.
Vous avez travaillé ensemble ?
Jarod vient du Grant.
Lieutenant Pratt.
Repos.
Officier de sécurité,
commandant Forrester.
J'ai étudié votre dossier.
Vos dates sur le Grant
ne collent pas.
Appelez le Grant pour vérifier.
Je le ferai.
Dès qu'il reviendra
de l'Antarctique,
le mois prochain.
Passez me voir demain.
ll lui faut un passe-temps.
Elle me rappelle quelqu'un.
Fouillez
dans les affaires de Jarod.
Appelez-moi quand aurez une piste.
- Où serez-vous ?
- Ailleurs.
Vous devez pouvoir m'aider.
Ca fait presque 30 ans.
Votre mère adorait les enfants.
Elle a dû en sauver
quelques-uns.
Sauver ?
C'est une longue histoire.
Elle a amené des enfants ici ?
Non, ils arrivent
par la filière habituelle :
orphelins, fugueurs,
victimes de sévices.
Je ne sais pas par où commencer.
Moi, si.
Sauvés
Désolé, ça ne me dit rien.
Tant pis.
Vous m'avez beaucoup aidée.
Qui est ce Jarod
dont vous parlez ?
Un associé.
ll aurait pu vous rendre visite.
Ca n'est pas une impasse,
Mlle Parker.
Celui qui m'a donné ça
est le roi de l'impasse.
Vous pourriez examiner
nos dossiers,
en consultant les archives.
Ces enfants datent d'avant 1970.
Cette année-là,
nos dossiers ont brûlé.
Vous avez eu un incendie en 1970 ?
En avril.
Comment le saviez-vous ?
Ma mère est morte à ce moment-là.
Repos.
Bonjour, mon commandant.
- Bienvenue sur le Monroe.
- Repos.
Un Bazooka
de ma réserve personnelle.
Pour moi ?
C'est intéressant.
Un chewing-gum
qui a le nom d'une arme.
Ca existe depuis un moment.
C'est très bon.
Et il y a une histoire dedans !
Très astucieux. Merci beaucoup.
Repos.
Lâchez-moi !
Laissez-moi tranquille !
J'ai rien pris, laissez-moi !
Arrêtez !
Où allez-vous ?
Ces deux types me poursuivent,
ce sont des détraqués.
C'est eux !
ll y a un problème, sergent ?
Elle piquait
la jeep de l'enseigne.
Menteur !
Je savais pas
qu'elle était à l'enseigne.
C'est la 3e fois en une semaine.
Je vois.
Je m'en occupe.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Melina Pratt.
Comme le lieutenant Pratt ?
Comme sa fille.
Vous allez tout lui dire ?
Et votre père ?
ll navigue sur le Farragut.
ll patrouille dans l'océan lndien.
ll est parti depuis 4 mois.
4 mois et demi.
C'est dur pour vous
et votre mère,
une si longue absence.
Ma mère travaille davantage.
Votre père est absent,
votre mère travaille.
Les adolescents semblent
rêver de cette liberté.
C'est vrai ?
Si ça vous intéresse,
devenez conseiller d'éducation.
J'ai essayé.
Les horaires étaient géniaux,
mais pas la nourriture.
Vous le direz à ma mère ou non ?
La prochaine fois
que vous faites une bêtise,
piquez la jeep de l'amiral.
Pas mal, pour une soudure
à l'acétylène.
C'est la vieille école,
mais ça tient bien.
Je n'ai pas de répit.
''Soude ça, répare ça...''
Aucun respect pour la tradition.
Vous devez avoir raison.
Excusez-moi.
Un problème ?
Repos.
Le quartier-maître Baker.
ll s'est battu il y a deux jours.
Je sais, vous aimez la discipline,
mais laissez Baker.
ll vient de perdre
son meilleur ami.
Scott Seaver.
Vous savez, la fuite de JX-5.
C'est vrai.
Seaver a saboté le réglage.
A cause de ça, le navire
a failli se retrouver en réserve.
Des sangsues
sont venues tout fouiller,
jusqu'au moindre dossier,
pour le sortir de l'eau.
ll a fallu sept amiraux
pour décider
que c'était la faute de Seaver.
Je vois.
Je laisserai Baker tranquille.
ll est sur ce navire
pour six mois.
Là où son ami est mort.
Tragédie sur un destroyer
Une fuite de gaz tue
un quartier-maître
Mon Dieu !
Baker, aide-moi !
lnspection surprise
ou vol de tuyaux boursiers ?
Je faisais seulement
connaissance avec le territoire.
Vous boursicotez ?
Bien obligé,
pour payer les études de mon fils.
C'est lui
qui choisit les actions.
ll a intérêt à bien choisir.
ll étudie l'économie ?
ll est malin,
intelligent,
mais n'a pas de bourse.
Je refuse qu'il passe sa vie
à suer dans un trou comme ça.
C'est vraiment pas
une inspection ?
Promis.
Ne le prenez pas mal,
mais je bosse sans arrêt
depuis que vous torpillez.
Vous me voyez comme ça ?
Tout ce que je dis,
c'est que c'est inutile
de surveiller le Lt Danes.
Repos.
Merci. Bonsoir.
C'est très drôle.
Ca existe encore ?
Mais pourquoi il a
un bandeau sur l'oeil ?
Je ne m'occupe pas
de problèmes cosmiques.
Je veux appeler l'amiral Mason
devant vous.
- Celui qui vous a recommandé.
- Comment l'oublier ?
Bureau de l'amiral Mason.
lci le Lt Pratt,
de la base de Long Beach.
Navrée, l'amiral est parti
pêcher à Bimini.
ll a bien de la chance.
ll est parti longtemps ?
Deux semaines.
On ne doit pas le déranger,
sauf en cas d'urgence.
Je rappellerai.
Raté.
Comme dirait Joe.
Je dois la voir !
- Je suis en réunion.
- Je sais.
Je veux aller voir R.E.M.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Un groupe.
Les billets sont en vente.
Je ne veux pas
que tu y ailles seule.
Je serai pas seule !
ll y aura 40 000 personnes.
On verra ça plus tard.
Comme d'habitude !
Ma fille.
Désolé, je suis déjà passé par là
Et ce tatouage ?
Vous me suivez ou quoi ?
Pas tout à fait.
Un agent de police
vous a laissé cette amende.
Génial !
Ma mère va être furax.
Surtout que vous avez volé
sa voiture.
Mais la rendre furax,
c'est un peu le but, non ?
Allez, essayez encore.
Aplatissez-le
et soufflez.
Dire qu'on vous a jamais appris !
J'ai eu une enfance solitaire.
Bienvenue au club.
l.L.Y. C'est encore un groupe ?
Non, simplement trois lettres
dont je veux me souvenir.
Que diront vos parents ?
Ma mère me déteste,
mon père est absent.
Votre mère ne vous déteste pas.
Les parents
aiment leurs enfants.
D'où vous sortez ?
Seaver est mort
par inhalation de JX-5
provenant
du système de refroidissement.
Des cristaux de glace
se sont formés dans ses poumons.
Un traumatisme supplémentaire...
Baker ! Mon Dieu !
Repos.
Asseyez-vous.
Moi aussi,
je fais des cauchemars.
Sur la famille
que je n'ai jamais vue,
les amis que j'ai perdus.
Seaver n'a pas saboté le réglage.
C'est pas parce que des amiraux
le disent...
Que c'est vrai.
Exactement.
Scott était à cran
la semaine précédente.
ll savait
qu'il y avait un problème.
Mais il n'aurait pas laissé
le Monroe partir comme ça.
lnutile de vous inquiéter,
je ne me battrai plus.
Qu'est-ce que vous dites ?
Je vais parler au Lt Pratt.
- Je m'en vais.
- Vous démissionnez ?
- Ca va arranger les choses ?
- Je l'ai vu mourir.
C'est arrivé tout d'un coup.
Le tuyau a cédé,
la salle s'est remplie de JX-5.
Scott m'a dit de sortir.
ll a dit qu'il se débrouillerait.
J'aurais pu le sauver.
Mais Nashton a fermé l'écoutille.
- Nashton ?
- Je voyais Scott
par le hublot.
ll inhalait du gaz.
Ca rend fou,
ça remplit les poumons
et ça les gèle.
ll étouffait.
Attendez !
Le commandant était sur le pont.
Pourquoi Nashton
aurait fermé l'écoutille ?
Selon lui,
tout le navire aurait explosé.
ll a dit
qu'il devait fermer l'écoutille.
Quel ami j'ai fait !
ll ne devait pas mourir.
J'aurais dû rester.
J'aurais dû mourir à sa place.
Ce n'est pas votre faute.
On a pensé le retirer
de la circulation,
mais sachez que le Monroe
est loin de la retraite.
Cet accident, cette tragédie
sont dus au mauvais travail
d'un jeune ingénieur
du nom de Scott Seaver.
Vous pensez
qu'il fallait fermer la salle ?
Le JX-5 aurait pu
se répandre partout.
Le navire risquait d'exploser.
Si j'avais pu le sauver,
je l'aurais fait.
Un officier est confronté
à ce genre de décision.
ll faut vivre avec ce démon.
J'ai agi pour sauver le navire.
Vous avez agi
pour sauver votre place.
La porte était ouverte.
Vous faites des visites
à domicile ?
Où étiez-vous ?
La dernière fois,
c'est Raines qui m'a demandé ça.
A quoi jouez-vous avec Jarod ?
Jouer ?
Les archives.
Vous commencez à poser
des questions, comme votre mère.
Dans sa dernière séance avec moi,
avant de prendre l'ascenseur,
elle cherchait des réponses.
Elle ne pouvait pas les trouver.
Moi, si.
Alors, vous finirez comme elle.
C'est une menace ?
Un avertissement,
de la part d'un ami.
Le courrier !
On a dû oublier de le distribuer.
Apporté
par le commandant en personne.
Merci.
Une lettre de mon fils
qui est en fac.
Cornell, Ca doit être cher.
Comment vous savez ?
lntéressant.
Une soudure à l'acétylène.
Seaver ne pouvait souder
qu'au tungstène.
Les amiraux auraient dû savoir
que Seaver n'avait pas touché
au réglage.
Nashton vous a forcé
à faire le boulot
après l'incident,
comme si c'était Seaver.
C'est de la folie.
Dites ça à Scott Seaver.
J'ai parlé à son meilleur ami.
ll a dit
que Seaver était nerveux.
ll était au courant.
Vous dites n'importe quoi !
Nashton a menacé votre carrière
ou les études de votre fils ?
Où est la différence ?
ll a dit qu'il me dénoncerait.
On m'aurait foutu à la porte
sans indemnités.
Seaver et moi,
on a dû signer le rapport
malgré le problème de JX-5.
Les amiraux l'ignoraient.
Les réparations
auraient retardé le départ,
ou pire...
auraient mis le Monroe en réserve.
Plus de Monroe,
plus de carrière pour Nashton.
C'est comme ça qu'un gamin
de 20 ans est mort asphyxié.
Ca aurait pu être vous.
Nashton a essayé
de sauver le gamin.
- Mais c'était trop tard.
- C'est faux !
Seaver savait la vérité.
Nashton voulait qu'il meure avec.
Vous allez manquer à votre mère.
lmpossible,
j'existe pas pour elle.
J'y retournerai pas. Jamais.
Vous avez l'impression
de ne pas compter ?
Vous vous sentez oubliée.
- Mais c'est faux.
- Vous en savez quoi ?
Je ne connais même pas
mes parents.
J'ignore s'ils m'ont abandonné
ou si j'ai été enlevé.
Mais je sais
qu'ils sont toujours là,
quelque part.
Je sais qu'ils m'aiment.
Au fond de moi, je le sais.
Et au fond de vous,
vous savez
que vos parents vous aiment.
Ma mère se réfugie dans le boulot
en l'absence de mon père.
Elle est responsable
de bien des vies.
Elle oublie peut-être
la plus importante.
Mais je sais
qu'elle vous aime beaucoup.
Mon père me manque tellement !
''l Love You.''
l.L.Y.
Mon père mettait ça dans
tous ses messages par satellite.
On n'a droit qu'à 40 mots,
alors, il faut abréger.
J'aimerais qu'il puisse
le dire en face.
Pardon, maman !
Pardon, ma chérie.
On parlera à la maison.
- Pardon.
- Ce n'est rien.
Elle est formidable.
Je devrais le lui dire
plus souvent.
Merci.
Vous êtes sûr
de vouloir démissionner ?
Ma décision est prise.
J'ai dit repos ?
Vous êtes sûr de votre décision ?
Oui !
C'est ce que Seaver aurait voulu ?
J'espère vous voir à bord.
Repos.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Je ne sais pas.
lls lui font mal !
Ne bouge pas !
Faites-la sortir !
Emmenez-le !
Jarod les a, n'est-ce pas ?
Quoi donc ?
Les réponses que vous cherchez.
Je le saurai en le retrouvant.
Vous en aurez peut-être
l'occasion.
Le commandant Jarod Forrester
est actuellement à bord
du destroyer Monroe.
On l'a localisé grâce à Broots.
Les services de renseignements
de la Marine
l'ont peut-être retrouvé.
- Les renseignements ?
- Exact.
Que mon père appelle le ministre.
- Arrêtez !
- Non !
Je voudrais acheter des billets.
De la part du ministre.
Je suis impressionnée.
J'espère bien.
Quel est le mot qui convient ?
Surprise.
Votre goût de la discipline
m'a inspiré.
On va faire une dernière
manoeuvre surprise.
Serrez au maximum.
L'arrivée de JX-5 ?
Ca va surcharger le système.
J'ai coupé la pression.
L'alarme sonnera, c'est tout.
Voyez ça
comme un séjour en enfer.
- Que reproche-t-on à Jarod ?
- Absolument tout.
Après vous.
Où sont les autres ?
lls dorment...
dans de beaux draps, comme vous.
Ouvrez-moi !
Ouvrez l'écoutille !
Ca commence à faire effet ?
Vous vous sentez désorienté ?
Ouvrez-moi !
Je ne peux pas.
Ca ferait sauter le navire.
Vous allez devoir mourir
pour sauver les autres,
comme Scott Seaver.
Quelle mort atroce !
Les poumons se remplissent
de glace toxique,
puis ils gèlent.
On a beau essayer,
on n'arrive pas à respirer.
Mais la décision m'appartient.
Considérez ça comme
un démon de plus à assumer
pour un officier.
Pas vrai, Nashton ?
Ouvrez-moi, c'est un ordre !
Je ne peux pas l'exécuter.
Je ne suis pas officier.
J'appartiens
aux renseignements de la Marine.
Je sais que vous avez forcé Danes
à maquiller les preuves
pour salir le nom de Seaver.
Pour sauver votre carrière,
vous avez laissé mourir un gamin.
Pas vrai ?
Je suis désolé.
Je l'ai laissé mourir.
Je ne mettrais pas le navire
en danger !
C'était du gaz hilarant.
Essayez de rire un peu.
Emmenez-le voir
le capitaine Nagel.
C'est un ordre.
Rompez !
Un des hommes
se fait passer pour un officier.
Je sais. Le voilà.
On parle du commandant Forrester.
Jarod appartient
aux services de renseignements.
- Où est-il ?
- Le ministre l'a rappelé.
Vous pouvez encore le rattraper.
ll paraît que je te manque,
tu me manques aussi.
Je t'aime, papa.
Allez au concert
avec un être cher...
Mlle Parker cherche,
que trouve-t-elle ?
Jarod aussi connaît un secret
sur elle.
L'océan le plus proche
est à 2 810 km d'ici.
Ca me convient tout à fait !

Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
Une expérience sur la sexualité.
- La reproduction ?
- C'en est une partie.
J'ai lu les manuels.
Lire, ce n'est pas ressentir.
J'ai quelqu'un à te présenter.
Tu es une fille.
Veux-tu m'épouser ?
Jamais !
lls semblent endurer la douleur.
Cette violence
fait rire les gens ?
Pas les gens. Les hommes.
- Pourquoi ?
- Allez savoir.
Les Stooges sont un mystère
entre les sexes.
Pas vous !
Je suis désolé,
mais c'est assez drôle.
Excusez-moi, je suis un vrai...
Stooge ?
Eh, l'obsédé,
ça fait $12,95.
Assez rigolé pour aujourd'hui.
Les rangers sont à la recherche
de Victor Simpkins,
étudiant en ornithologie
disparu dans la montagne.
J'ai interrogé sa mère.
Au début,
j'ai cru qu'il était en retard,
mais ça fait 5 jours.
Je prie pour qu'il aille bien.
Un orage est annoncé.
On espère le retrouver
à temps.
En direct de Toluca,
David Milkson, d'Action 15.
Tenez votre...
ll me manque un gars
pour Scovell Ridge,
entre B-1 et B-7.
C'est pentu, broussailleux
et très glissant.
Qui ça tente ?
Je suis votre homme.
- Vous avez de l'expérience ?
- Quelques années
dans l'armée.
Spécialisé dans la montagne.
- T'es un leader né.
- Si on veut.
Votre nom ?
Jarod... Forrest.
Ecoutez-moi.
Les éclaireurs
sont partis à l'aube.
On part dans 30 mn.
Ca fait 5 jours
et sa mère s'inquiète.
Le temps presse.
ll faut tout fouiller.
On cherche une aiguille
sans savoir
où est la botte de foin.
- Derrick Kobey.
- Enchanté.
On a vu Victor Simpkins
avant sa disparition ?
Personne le cherchait.
Le chef m'a collé à la paperasse
pendant qu'il s'amusait.
''S'amusait'' ?
Sur la face nord,
à poser des charges.
C'est plein de ravins,
de grottes...
Tu tombes là-dedans...
Même Moby Dick,
on le retrouve pas.
- Tu connais bien le terrain ?
- Huit ans.
Je suis venu dans un stage d'éveil
pour les jeunes de la cité.
Et ça a marché.
J'adore le Bronx,
mais ma place est ici.
Alors, Forrest,
vous avez été formé où ?
Dans la montagne.
Sérieusement.
Vous étiez à Fort Lewis ?
- Vous venez de l'armée ?
- 15 ans.
Vous avez connu
le sergent Tripcheck,
un instructeur ?
Ca me dit quelque chose.
ll ment, Stan.
En fait, c'est un Stooge.
Vous vous connaissez ?
On s'est rentrés dedans.
- C'est une ranger ?
- Non, une volontaire.
Elle tient un atelier
de confection pas loin.
Vous faites pas d'illusions.
C'est une solitaire.
Les éclaireurs ont trouvé
la tente de Simpkins.
On va se répartir
en deux équipes.
Appelez-moi toutes les 30 mn.
Où est Forrest ?
Un problème de Force ?
- La Force ?
- Obi wan Kenobi...
La Guerre des étoiles.
Le système de défense ?
Vous faites quoi ?
J'essaie de savoir
qui est Victor.
Et qui
s'isolerait volontairement
des mois dans la montagne.
Quelqu'un qui se cherche.
En pleine brousse ?
ll faut parfois se perdre
pour se trouver.
Jarod Forrest.
Parlez-moi de votre fils.
Si ça peut vous aider.
ll est droitier ou gaucher ?
Droitier.
ll a des livres
sur les oiseaux de proie.
ll a passé des mois à étudier
la nidification des aigles.
ll les aime depuis tout petit.
ll les observe,
assis devant sa tente,
des jours entiers.
ll est ma seule famille.
Rassurez-vous, on le trouvera.
On ne quittera pas
la montagne avant.
Avec qui je suis ?
Moe.
Vous semblez perplexe.
Je le suis.
ll est resté ici des mois
et il n'y a ni déchets
ni latrines.
- Donc ?
- Je ne sais pas.
C'est un indice.
Vous êtes un drôle de Stooge, Moe.
Pourquoi cette histoire
de droitier ?
Ses lunettes étaient à gauche
du duvet.
Bizarre, pour un droitier.
Par ici.
Quelqu'un a recouvert des traces.
Elles vont par là.
Je voulais pas vous effrayer.
Ca va, je vivrai.
15 jours de moins,
mais je vivrai.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Voici Nia.
Bob.
Vous m'avez fait peur.
Je peux pas vous serrer la main.
La prochaine fois.
Vous vous cachez ?
Non, je cherche.
Vous êtes dans l'équipe
de recherches ?
Une équipe de recherches
pour Bob ?
- Bob, c'est pas vous ?
- Je suis Gros Bob.
Je cherche Petit Bob,
mon associé.
- On cherche un étudiant.
- Sa tente est à 5 km.
Brun, environ 1,80 m.
Connais pas. J'ai rien vu.
On alerte quelqu'un
pour Petit Bob ?
Non. Ca le mettrait en rogne.
Je l'ai déjà vu
démolir un bar entier.
- Et si on le trouve ?
- Je vous le souhaite pas.
ll aime pas les étrangers.
ll aime personne.
Un vilain orage qui s'amène.
Vilain.
Et avant les rangers ?
Pilote d'essai,
chirurgie à coeur ouvert,
commandant sur un destroyer,
la routine.
Et vous, avant la confection ?
Astronaute, patineuse olympique,
le Prix Nobel, la routine.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
C'est un mousqueton.
J'y vais.
Un grimpeur n'oublie pas ça.
Attention.
Vous ne connaissez pas.
C'est dangereux.
Du calme.
J'ai été sherpa dans l'Everest.
C'est vrai.
Attention.
Les marques sont fraîches.
Ca remonte à quelques jours.
C'est à Victor.
Le ruban orange.
Le symbole inuit des aigles.
Les initiales,
il trouvait ça commun.
C'est un grimpeur averti.
ll ne laisserait pas son matériel
à moins de...
Le soleil se lève à 6h35.
On se déploiera de K-4 à K-8,
au pied de la falaise.
Rendez-vous ici à 5h45.
On annonce un front froid
dans 48 h.
Mon fils survivra ?
C'est un grimpeur averti.
ll aura froid et faim,
mais on a survécu à pire.
Je sais qu'il est quelque part,
inquiet pour vous.
Tout le monde va se coucher.
On décolle à l'aube.
Kobey, où est le motel
le plus proche ?
A environ 150 km.
Mais il est miteux.
J'ai une chambre d'amis.
Prenez vos affaires.
J'attends dehors.
T'as pas perdu de temps.
Señorita lceberg
t'invite à faire dodo ?
T'as un ticket !
Pour aller où ?
C'est un vieux lit
et à part quelques ressorts,
il est confortable.
Ca ira très bien.
Casa Rosada.
Vous êtes argentine.
Ce sont vos parents ?
Un gringo qui connaît
la Maison-Blanche argentine.
Vous m'impressionnez.
- C'est tout ?
- Je voyage léger.
En cavale ?
Ca m'arrive.
Je fais beaucoup de recherches.
Enlevez votre chemise.
Pourquoi vous n'avez rien dit ?
Je ne me rendais pas compte.
Je vous laisse de l'eau chaude.
Tu es une fille.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Et toi ?
Mlle Parker.
La douche est à vous.
Dormez bien.
Vous aussi.
lci Sydney.
C'est moi.
ll faut que je vous parle...
des femmes.
Pourquoi ?
J'en ai rencontré une.
Ca va aller.
Ne craignez rien.
C'est moi.
ll faut que je vous parle
des femmes.
Pourquoi ?
- J'en ai rencontré une.
- Raconte.
J'en ai croisé des tas
depuis mon évasion,
maisje n'ai jamais ressenti
ce que je ressens là.
Que ressens-tu ?
Ma vue se trouble
à son approche.
Au moindre contact,
les battements de mon coeur
et ma respiration s'accélèrent.
Frankenstein a une chérie.
C'est chimique, Jarod.
Chimique ?
Ce que tu ressens
est la réaction de ton corps
à un stimulus...
lci, une femme.
Quand elle est sortie
de la douche...
Là !
Ca va pas ?
C'est là que la radio
est le plus audible.
En trafiquant un peu,
on trouvera peut-être la chanson.
Je n'ai pas entendu de radio.
Je veux écouter la suite.
Un indice a pu vous échapper.
Si Victor est descendu là,
il a dû passer
entre cette falaise et le fleuve.
En cas de trouvaille,
on est sur le canal 9.
Allez, on y va !
On a bien trouvé
le mousqueton ici ?
Oui. Pourquoi ?
La Force est avec vous ?
Pourquoi il n'a pas
contourné la falaise ?
Peut-être une lubie.
On ne prévoit pas toujours.
ll faut croire.
Merci d'avoir été là, cette nuit.
Vous avez dit que
vous ne vouliez pas disparaître.
- J'ai dit ça ?
- Deux fois.
En espagnol.
Vous avez mal compris.
J'ai la copie de la bande
que vous vouliez.
La conversation de Jarod.
Vous êtes encore ici ?
Tu as peur de moi ?
Hier, tu avais peur.
Ca se voyait.
J'étais nerveux.
Tu as la peau douce.
Tu ne m'as pas touchée.
Si.
Là.
Tends ta main, comme ça.
Tu sens ?
Comment tu t'appelles ?
Ton prénom ?
Une chose m'échappe.
lls s'appellent Les Trois Stooges
mais ils sont
quatre.
Avec Shemp.
Cinq, en comptant Joe Besser,
ce que personne ne fait,
et six, en comptant
Curly Joe Durita,
qui n'est même pas drôle
en espagnol.
- Larry est un des frères ?
- Non. Moe, Curly...
Quoi ?
Ca va ?
Je peux pas vous serrer la main.
C'est notre 2e rencontre.
Vous êtes passé
entre deux pins.
Pas question.
Et votre associé ?
Je ferai la cueillette sans lui.
La cueillette ?
Oui, et celle de Petit Bob.
ll est malade ?
Les nerfs.
L'avion de vendredi l'a effrayé.
Avec la dynamite,
il a pété les plombs.
De la dynamite, ici ?
Le ranger Conrad
a dégagé des sentiers.
K-4, vous m'entendez ?
lci Forrest.
J'ai trouvé le sac de Victor
à 400 m de la falaise,
sur la rive du fleuve.
Ses pas mènent à l'eau.
ll a dû se blesser en tombant
et s'évanouir dans l'eau.
S'il ne s'est pas noyé,
il est en aval...
ou dans le Pacifique.
Vous arrêtez les recherches ?
Non, madame.
Je passe le relais.
La police d'Anawalt
mènera les recherches
jusqu'à la côte.
J'ai appelé le shérif Hansen.
C'est un homme bien.
ll fera son possible.
Suivez-moi.
ll a du matériel et des vivres
pour plusieurs jours.
ll étudiait
la nidification des aigles.
ll n'y a rien pour écrire.
C'est pas logique.
Sa tente, son mousqueton...
Le sac à dos...
Qu'est-ce que ça signifie ?
Quelqu'un veut
qu'on le recherche en aval.
Vous n'y allez pas ?
ll est dans la montagne.
Vous m'entendez ?
Simulation Apollo.
On est alertés par l'étincelle
qui enflamme l'oxygène
dans la capsule.
J'essaie de fuir,
mais je ne peux pas.
Je suis attaché.
Je connais la procédure,
mais le feu... la chaleur...
J'essaie de ne pas respirer,
mais c'est trop tard.
Le hublot est coincé.
Le hublot est coincé.
ll fait trop chaud
pour penser !
Personne ne peut nous sauver !
Je brûle !
Je brûle !
Je suis là. Tout va bien.
Personne ne pouvait les sauver.
C'était impossible.
Je vous ai laissé de l'eau chaude.
Ce garçon, c'est vous ?
C'est dingue,
mais je peux l'expliquer.
On a tous des cicatrices.
- Dans combien de temps ?
- Dur à dire.
J'avais cru entendre
''l Shot the Sheriff'',
mais en refiltrant,
j'ai reconnu
''Bungle in the Jungle''.
Dans combien de temps ?
Avec les listes des programmes
BMl et ASCAP,
Ca peut être long.
Mais dès qu'on aura trouvé
la station,
l'ordinateur nous appellera.
- Et en avant la musique.
- En avant la musique.
Dans combien de temps ?
Réveillez-vous.
Je crois que j'ai trouvé.
On grimpe depuis 9 heures.
On cherche quoi, au juste ?
Ca.
Le campement de Victor.
La Force est avec vous.
Comment vous avez su ?
Un truc me gênait,
avec la tente de Simpkins.
Elle était trop bas
pour les aigles.
lls nichent toujours
sur les sommets.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
L'avion qui a effrayé Petit Bob.
Le pilote est mort.
Une balle dans la tête.
ll y a des traces de narcotiques.
J'ai trouvé ça.
Livrez la drogue,
ramassez le fric.
Ces vols ne sont pas enregistrés.
S'ils s'écrasent...
Personne ne vous cherche.
Quelqu'un est passé ici.
ll y a deux séries de pas.
Elles viennent
de directions différentes.
Et l'une poursuit l'autre.
Par ici...
ll a entendu l'avion s'écraser.
ll est descendu.
ll voulait aider.
ll a vu le meurtre.
ll s'enfuit.
ll craint pour sa vie.
Victor Simpkins.
Qui le poursuivait ?
Qui dégageait des sentiers
quand Bob a entendu l'avion ?
Conrad.
ll dirige les recherches.
Comment vous avez...
La Force, Jedi.
J'ai vu la vidéo, hier soir.
Ces traces vont vers Box Canyon.
On ira demain.
J'espère que Victor
a une couverture,
parce que sinon,
il ne tiendra pas.
Et nous non plus,
si on ne trouve pas un abri.
Je connais un endroit.
Crétins...
ll faut que je vous parle...
des femmes.
Des femmes.
Les filles sont plus mûres
que les garçons.
Rien de tel qu'un plat maison.
C'est ce qu'on dit.
Quand j'étais petit...
j'ai été enlevé.
Je crois que j'ai été enlevé...
par ces gens...
qui m'ont élevé.
J'ai dû faire des choses
qui ont fait du mal à d'autres...
- Pas besoin de m'en parler.
- Je sais.
Je n'en ai parlé à personne,
mais je veux vous le dire.
Je ne sais pas qui je suis.
Vous êtes Jarod.
Et vous êtes avec moi.
A quel âge êtes-vous partie
d'Argentine ?
A treize ans.
A cause de la Guerra Sucia ?
J'ai vu vos cicatrices.
J'avais huit ans.
lls sont venus sans raison.
Mon père éditait un journal.
Ma mère l'avait rencontré
quand elle était reporter,
mais elle ne travaillait plus.
Je lui donnais trop à faire.
lls nous ont réveillés une nuit.
J'entendais ma mère hurler,
les insulter.
Je ne l'avais jamais entendue
jurer comme ça.
lls nous ont emmenés
dans cet endroit.
Cet endroit horrible.
Je ne les ai jamais revus.
lls m'ont frappée.
Je suis désolé.
lls voulaient que je mente
sur mes parents.
Que je dise qu'ils complotaient
contre les généraux.
J'ai refusé de mentir.
lls ont fini par me libérer.
lls m'ont placée dans une famille.
Personne ne voulait me parler
de mes parents.
lls avaient disparu.
Ensuite, les généraux sont partis.
Je suis venue ici.
Je ne sais pas si mes parents
sont morts ou vivants.
Moi non plus.
lls me manquent beaucoup.
Je sais...
Vous allez trouver ça dingue.
Je n'ai jamais...
Je veux juste savoir qui je suis.
Je peux tout endurer pour ça.
Ce cochon porte une casquette ?
Te voilà !
Le stress l'a fait maigrir.
Viens là, mon grand.
C'est votre cochon ?
C'est mon associé
dans l'empire du champignon.
Petit Bob !
Le seul et unique.
Vous ramassez des truffes ?
Le meilleur nez des USA.
ll avait trouvé le filon.
Mais quelqu'un a fait sauter
la mine
où il avait trouvé...
La mine ?
Celle de Box Canyon.
Elle a sauté le jour de l'avion.
Viens là, mon grand.
Des pas.
Deux séries.
Deux qui entrent,
une seule qui sort.
Conrad poursuit Victor
pour le faire taire.
Victor vient se cacher ici.
Conrad, à court de temps,
décide de sceller l'entrée,
le bloquant à l'intérieur.
La Force est avec moi.
Victor !
Ca va.
Vous allez vous en tirer.
LES TROlS STOOGES
Essayez de m'attraper
La chanson passait
sur une petite radio de l'Oregon.
Parc national de Toluca.
lci Conrad.
lci Bob Carsey.
Je crois que j'ai trouvé...
Où est-il ?
ll est en vie ?
Je sais pas. ll est coincé
dans la mine de cuivre
de Box Canyon.
J'ai à peine réussi
a voir à l'intérieur.
J'arrive.
Kobey, restez ici
pour coordonner l'opération.
- J'appelle sa mère ?
- Pas avant qu'on soit rassurés.
Simpkins !
ll était temps.
Je commençais
à avoir des crampes.
On dirait Lazare,
pas vrai, Conrad ?
Quoi ? Simpkins va bien ?
Est-ce qu'il est vivant ?
Pour témoigner contre vous ?
Un peu, mon neveu !
ll fallait appeler la police.
La cargaison vous intéresse ?
- ll y en a encore.
- Sans façon.
Ca fout la trouille, hein ?
A votre avis, l'enfer
ressemble à ça ?
lmaginez-vous coincé ici...
Personne pour entendre vos cris...
ll n'y a qu'une issue.
Vous devriez reculer.
Me laissez pas là !
Vous en faites pas.
Je dirigerai les recherches
moi-même, dans quelques jours.
Un ranger arrêté
Cupidité, meurtre et dynamite
Je sais faire des tas de choses.
Mais je ne sais pas faire ça.
Je sais que tu dois partir.
ll y a des gens qui me cherchent.
Si je reste, tu seras en danger.
Tu l'es peut-être déjà.
Je saurai me débrouiller.
Je te souhaite
de trouver ce que tu cherches.
Tu m'as aidé
à en trouver une partie.
Avez-vous vu cet homme ?
ll était grand, beau.
Un grain de beauté
sous l'oeil.
ll est resté quelques nuits.
ll est parti.
ll a dit où il allait ?
ll m'a dit qu'il aimait
l'Argentine.
Vous croyez qu'il reviendra ?
Je l'espère.

Un homme perd l'usage de son bras
Jarod avait un caractčre
trčs égal.
ll est resté une semaine
et il est parti.
Je suis gérant de l'immeuble,
mais ma vraie passion,
c'est l'acupuncture.
Jarod y a pris goűt, lui aussi.
Vous lui avez planté
des aiguilles ?
En fait,
je lui ai appris ŕ se le faire.
- Pourquoi ?
- Réduire le stress.
Je sais trčs bien réduire
les tensions dans le corps.
C'est drôle.
Je sais trčs bien les provoquer.
ll voulait des aiguilles
le long du plexus brachial.
Le plexus brachial ?
Le centre nerveux
des membres supérieurs ?
ll voulait que son bras
soit paralysé.
ll est resté comme ça des jours.
Vous avez connu les années 60.
Votre amie connaît-elle
le concept de l'amour libre ?
Quand est-il parti ?
ll y a deux jours.
Alors, grâce ŕ Dieu,
notre travail ici est terminé.
Cela risque de vous manquer.
ll m'a dit que vous sauriez.
Un propriétaire

Cet immeuble n'est pas loin.
Oů est mon cameraman ?
Ca fait haut.
Laissez-moi.
Je veux seulement vous parler.
Jarod, qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Fais tourner ta machine.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Et vous ?
Dave. Je m'appelle Dave.
Jolie famille.
C'est votre femme
et vos enfants ?
lls sont partis.
lls ont été expulsés
et je ne les trouve plus.
Je suis sűr qu'ils vont bien,
qu'ils s'inquičtent pour vous.
Personne ne s'inquičte pour moi.
Si c'était vrai,
je ne serais pas ici.
Je suis sűr qu'ils vous cherchent.
Pourquoi ?
Je bois, je ne sais pas
garder un boulot.
Je les ai perdus pour de bon.
Je peux vous aider ŕ les trouver,
avec la caméra.
Dites-leur que vous les aimez,
qu'ils vous manquent,
que vous avez besoin d'eux.
Mais d'abord,
il faut descendre d'ici.
Prenez-moi la main.
Pour ętre mieux,
il aurait fallu
une strip-teaseuse.
- Pauvre type.
- Annie, monte des clips
pour la promo.
Ca passe ce soir.
ll faut filmer sa famille.
lls sont peut-ętre
dans un foyer.
lls méritent un peu d'intimité.
Contre un peu de fric,
elle sautera sur l'occasion.
Sans jeu de mots.
Dommage que tu aies
tant de poigne.
- Pourquoi ?
- Ton héroďsme
l'a sauvé.
Un saut aurait été plus vendeur.
Ainsi parle celui qui veut
récupérer le JT.
Mon instinct me dit
que ta tęte
sera dans toutes les chaumičres.
Ce serait mieux si Phil
récoltait les lauriers.
Quoi ?
C'est lui qui a du talent,
le héros des téléspectateurs,
pas moi.
Un seul problčme :
notre héros
était en bas sur le parking.
Mais on n'a pas vu ma tęte.
On coupe aprčs le sauvetage,
on prend les images prises en bas,
on ajoute la voix de Phil
et on termine avec Phil et Dave
sortant de l'immeuble.
On a besoin de redorer
notre blason. Fais-le.
- Mais c'est...
- Pas éthique ?
Fais de Phil un héros.
Normalement, c'est Dieu
qui écrit l'histoire.
ll est pas reporter.
Joli quartier.
Je comprends que Jarod ait laissé
le cahier ŕ l'acupuncteur.
- ll ne veut pas qu'on vienne.
- On est lŕ.
Voyons si le cobaye
a laissé des indices.
C'est inutile.
Jarod est parti depuis longtemps.
Peur du noir, Syd ?
Uniquement
quand je n'y vois rien.
On devrait appeler l'équipe
de nettoyeurs.
Laissez tomber.
J'échangerais 12 Ferragamo
contre un Jarod n'importe quand.
Je compte jusqu'ŕ trois
et, qui que vous soyez,
je tire.
Un...
Deux...
Trois.
Que voulez-vous ?
Vous avez quoi ?
J'ai un 9 mm pointé sur vous
et vous avez un couteau,
un couteau rouillé.
C'est votre jour de chance.
Votre jour de chance ?
Prends le fric.
On se casse.
Sydney, pourquoi
ne me répondez-vous pas ?
Tu fais une copie pour Phil ?
J'essaie de joindre
un vieil ami.
Tu trouves
que j'ai eu tort de laisser Phil
récolter les lauriers ?
Je suis payée pour monter,
pas pour penser.
Et ça t'a valu des prix.
Les prix ne comptent gučre, ici.
Pulitzer est dans sa tombe
et Nielsen mange la poussičre.
Phil m'a demandé de regarder
ses vieux reportages,
pour voir son style.
Tu peux me montrer
ses cassettes ?
- Deuxičme rayon.
- Merci.
La fusillade de Ken watanabe.
J'en ai entendu parler.
Comme la moitié du monde.
Et notre tyran local
trouvait que c'était pas assez.
Chris est payé pour savoir
ce que veut le public
et nous, pour le lui donner.
C'est pas une raison pour renier
notre intégrité de journaliste.
''Si ça saigne, ça baigne.''
C'est comme ça, Annie.
Soit on prend la vague,
soit on coule.
C'est de la frime.
En secret,
Phil voue un culte ŕ Cronkite.
Qui est Cronkite ?
Tu seras ŕ ta place, ici.
Ce soir,
en exclusivité sur Channel 43,
un reportage
sur la guerre des gangs.
Des images sensationnelles.
Notre cameraman, Ken Watanabe,
a filmé le meeting d'un gang
dans le quartier
de North Puget.
Mais nous n'avions pas prévu
ce qui a suivi.
Les Bleeders de la 15e Rue
ont fait irruption chez les Burrs,
déclenchant un conflit explosif
dont l'un des nôtres
a été victime.
Je suis blessé !
Phil, oů es-tu ?
Phil, je suis blessé !
Mon bras !
Je peuxplus le bouger.
Sors-moi de lŕ.
Nous prions pour Ken Watanabe,
jeune cameraman courageux.
Dieu te bénisse, Ken.
C'était Phil Campbell pour le JT,
sur Channel 43.

Dalila, je pense tellement ŕ vous
que ma tęte me fait mal.
Je dois vous rencontrer,
vous voir...
J'ai peur, Samson.
lci Samson... Broots.
M. Parker...
Que puis-je pour vous ?
Non, je n'ai pas vu votre fille
depuis hier.
Sydney aussi... non plus.
Oui, monsieur,
je m'en occupe tout de suite.
C'était un plaisir
de vous parler...
Ca a l'air d'aller.
Un pas aprčs l'autre.
C'est ce qu'on me dit.
Je venais vous remercier.
Comme ça a été diffusé,
je devrais peut-ętre
remercier Phil.
C'est spécial, la télé.
Content que vous alliez bien.
Je sais pas ce qui m'a pris.
Vous avez retrouvé
votre famille ?
Ma femme veut pas de moi
avant que j'aie un boulot.
J'ouvrirai l'oeil.
Qu'est-ce que vous regardez ?
Ces câbles, lŕ.
S'ils comptent y brancher
la parabole,
ils vont tout faire sauter.
Vous ętes électricien ?
J'étais chez Satcom.
Je saute pas mieux
d'un avion que d'un immeuble,
mais je sais reconnaître
un problčme de branchement.
Merci encore.
Bonne chance.
Ces trucs sont excellents.
Le résultat de 20 ans de télé.
Surtout le reportage
avec Ken watanabe.
Vous n'auriez pas gardé
les chutes ?
J'aimerais étudier le montage.
La plupart des bandes
sont recyclées.
Męme sur un truc aussi bon ?
J'avais un parking gratuit,
avant.
Bien joué, Dave !
Comme si se faire agresser
suffisait pas...
Vous m'avez tiré dessus.
Je ne vous ai pas tiré dessus.
C'était un accident.
Je n'ai jamais aimé les armes.
J'espčre
que vous cesserez
d'en porter une.
Vous saignez ŕ nouveau.
ll me faut de quoi
bander la plaie.
Pourquoi pas votre foulard ?
C'est une pičce unique.
C'est ce que sera
ma bonne jambe
si on n'arręte pas l'hémorragie.
Merci.
C'est le choc.
ll faut vous réchauffer.
Ne regardez pas.
lls sont sur le point
de faire sauter cette ruine.
Dites-moi
que quelqu'un sait oů on est.
Y a un truc qui m'échappe.
Quoi ?
Oů sont les petits ?
Les quoi ?
On ne voit
que les gros pigeons,
blessés, les ailes cassées,
mais jamais les petits.
Je n'y avais jamais pensé.
Je vous connais.
Vous ętes le cameraman
de la télé.
Jarod Crane.
Ken.
C'est incroyable,
ce que vous avez filmé.
Merci. Je ne pensais pas
devenir le sujet du reportage.
Vous reprenez quand,
ŕ la télé ?
Pour faire quoi ?
Enregistrer des pubs ?
Je suis un type du front.
Ma carričre est finie.
C'est drôle. On imagine
que sa vie va suivre un chemin
et quand on y arrive enfin,
le pont s'écroule.
On ne sait jamais.
La vie a le don
de vous surprendre.
Regardez.
Nom d'un chien...
Comme je disais,
la vie est pleine de surprises.
Ken Watanabe et Phil Campbell.
18 février. Premičre bobine.
Pas la peine de fignoler.
On y va,
on s'assied et on écoute les Burrs
raconter leur histoire.
lls parlent avec leur flingue.
Je risque pas de fignoler.
T'inquičte pas, Ken.
Ca va aller.
On y va.
T'es sűr qu'ils vont venir ?
T'inquičte pas...
Par ici.
Tu fréquentes la racaille, Phil ?
Yo ! D-Mac !
Je suis blessé !
Mon bras !
Je suis blessé !
Sors-moi de lŕ.
Sors-moi de lŕ.
Joli tricot de corps, Phil.
Un gilet pare-balles
comme tenue de travail, Phil ?
ll me faut une cigarette.
Comment diable
je me suis retrouvée lŕ ?
Vous regrettez la mission Jarod ?
Je regrette plein de choses.
Par exemple ?
D'avoir manqué le bal de la fac.
Je regrette...
de m'ętre moquée
de mon 1 er petit ami
quand il m'a dit :
''Tu es la femme idéale.''
Et en cet instant, je regrette
de ne pas avoir un Nicopatch
gros comme un paillasson.
Votre ulcčre...
Pas de médicaments.
Mesdames, messieurs,
le fabuleux Sherlock Holmes !
Laissez-moi regarder.
Les regrets résultent souvent
d'un manque de choix.
Contrairement ŕ vous,
je ne crois pas que tout m'échappe.
Sauf quand il s'agit
de votre pčre.
Ne le prenez pas mal.
Dites-le.
J'ai cédé.
Je le fais toujours,
avec lui.
Vous pouvez toujours
lui dire : ''Papa,
''je m'en vais.''
C'est ça.
Je vois ça d'ici :
deux gosses, une petite maison,
la causette au centre commercial.
Vous avez encore un avenir,
Parker.
Bel avenir...
en attendant de voler en éclats.
Et moi qui essaie
de vous réconforter.
Comme si vous pouviez
me réconforter.
Je l'ai fait, une fois.
Sacré tireur !
ll suffit de comprendre
l'aérodynamique.
En fait, je ferme un oeil
et je lâche.
Et voilŕ. Belle partie.
J'ai horreur de perdre.
C'est ma tournée.
Phil est de bonne humeur
ce soir.
Vous ętes fier ? Phil et Annie
nominés pour le sujet sur Ken.
Męme des nuls comme Phil
ont de la veine.
Les prix font de la pub,
mais ça rend paresseux.
Pour ętre reporter,
il faut avoir faim.
Vous restez ŕ l'eau
ou vous venez ?
Et toi...
souris.
C'est ŕ propos de Ken ?
ll devrait ętre lŕ.
On a oublié de l'inviter.
ll devait ętre fier
d'apporter ce prix.
La chaîne a une mutuelle en or.
- watanabe va bien.
- ll va s'en tirer.
On sait tous que les risques
font partie du boulot.
Ken débutait.
ll a fait du zčle
et il l'a payé.
Si j'avais su,
je l'aurais pas laissé y aller.
J'en suis sűr.
Excusez-moi, la Tour me harcčle
pour que je les trouve.
ll y a une équipe de nettoyeurs
dans la zone de New York ?
Pardon ? Mon numéro d'autorisation
ne vous regarde pas.
Vous commencez sérieusement
ŕ m'énerver.
Ne quittez pas.
C'est moi.
lnutile de me pister,
j'ai brouillé
le signal de la source.
J'essaie de joindre Sydney.
Bienvenue au club.
ll est parti avec Mlle Parker.
Depuis 48 h, aucune nouvelle.
Elle est trop persévérante
pour son bien.
ll faut les trouver.
Je suis tranquille, sans elle.
Vous voulez bosser
pour Raines ?
Notez cette adresse.
1 811 , Bushnell Street.
Dans le Bronx.
Comment ma mčre est morte ?
Cessez de vous torturer.
Elle ne s'est pas suicidée.
On l'a tuée parce qu'elle
sauvait des enfants ?
J'en sais rien.
C'est mon pčre ?
Je connais la vie de votre mčre,
pas sa mort.
C'était une femme gentille,
une inspiration pour le Centre,
quand il travaillait encore
ŕ des projets altruistes.
Je n'imagine pas le Centre męlé
ŕ quoi que ce soit de positif.
Nous avons aidé 4 pays
ŕ devenir des démocraties
pendant la Guerre froide.
Nous avons participé
ŕ l'accord coréen. Et la rumeur
dit qu'on a męme dessiné
la papamobile.
Le Centre
a sauvé des milliers de vies.
Vies qu'ils ont, par la suite,
reprises... par d'autres moyens.
Pourquoi ętes-vous resté,
quand les choses ont changé ?
ll y avait des gens
dont le sort
m'inquiétait plus que le mien.
ll n'est gučre différent de nous.
Nous aurions tous pris
des chemins différents,
si nous avions eu le choix.
Excusez-moi.
Vous avez marché.
Vous ętes dingue, idiot
ou les deux ŕ la fois.
Aprčs avoir levé votre pied pivot,
vous avez fait plus des 2 pas
autorisés par la rčgle.
Merci, elle est prédécoupée.
Servez-vous.
Vous ętes suicidaire ou quoi ?
- Pas que je sache.
- Votre mčre vous a pas dit
de pas traîner
dans les quartiers noirs ?
Je n'ai pas vraiment eu de mčre.
La réponse est non.
Jarod Crane.
Je travaille pour Channel 43.
Je cherche D-Mac.
Pour le filmer ?
Peut-ętre bien.
C'est moi, D-Mac.
Enchanté.
Ce cameraman
aurait pas dű ętre lŕ.
- Racontez-moi.
- Un mec me joint sur le portable.
ll a dű payer
pour avoir mon numéro.
Un Blanc, ŕ la voix.
ll voulait causer de la guerre
des gangs. ll avait l'air réglo.
Qu'un Blanc vous appelle,
c'est inhabituel ?
Vous avez vraiment
pas eu de mčre.
Moi non plus,
je l'ai pas connue.
ll avait aussi appelé
les Bleeders.
lls se sont pointés et...
Ca a pété.
Vous vous rappelez le jour ?
Duane, mon organizer.
On est pas des sauvages.
Le 18 février,
vers huit heures du soir.
Votre numéro de portable ?
Emmenez Mlle Parker ŕ l'étage.
Allez vous reposer.
Si vous voulez me parler,
je suis toujours lŕ.
Merci, Sydney.
Pourquoi les gens sont en noir ?
Pourquoi vous ętes triste ?
On commémore quelqu'un
qui nous a quittés.
La femme qu'on a tuée
dans l'ascenseur ?
La mčre de Mlle Parker ?
Ne parle plus jamais de ça
ŕ quiconque, compris ?
J'aurais pu le sauver.
Qui ?
ll aurait vécu une vie normale.
lls vous auraient tué.
On ne peut pas tuer
quelqu'un qui est déjŕ mort.
Vous vous souvenez.
Tu m'as volé des images ?
Je te les ai empruntées.
Je l'ai fait pour Ken watanabe.
Je ne te suis pas.
Ken a été piégé.
- Quoi ?
- C'est arrivé ŕ Ken
parce que Phil
court aprčs l'audience.
Je ne te crois pas.
Crois-le.
Pourquoi Phil portait
un gilet pare-balles
le soir oů Ken a été blessé ?
Tu crois Phil capable de ça ?
J'en suis sűr.
Annie, tu le connais.
Tu sais qu'il est sous pression
pour revenir au top.
Risquer la vie de quelqu'un ?
ll est aux abois.
C'était le meilleur
et il a baissé.
Tu dois m'aider ŕ l'arręter.
lci Jarod. Ca vous dit,
de travailler pour Channel 43 ?
Dites ŕ votre femme
que vous avez du boulot.
Lumičre.
Caméra.
Annie ? J'organise une projection
spéciale dans le bureau de Chris.
Rends-moi un service.
Fais venir le directeur
de la chaîne.
Action !
Chris a eu vent d'un sommet
entre 2 gangs rivaux.
ll pense que ça fera une suite
géniale ŕ l'affaire watanabe.
Chris t'a branché dessus ?
Sa source a dit
que ça allait péter.
Si ça pčte,
y aura de l'audience. On y va.
Vérifie ton micro.
On s'installe oů ?
Par ici.
On couvre la porte
et on reste dans l'ombre.
- Je le sens pas.
- L'endroit fout la trouille.
Et Ken a été blessé
lŕ-dehors.
C'est peut-ętre lié.
Mais les risques
font partie du boulot.
Oů sont ces cons ?
On va pas les attendre.
Jarod, t'es oů ?
Lŕ-haut.
C'est pas bon.
Je t'ai ŕ l'image.
Souris, Phil.
Tu es filmé.
Pourquoi le directeur est lŕ ?
Tu as rendez-vous avec lui.
M. Ferren, quelle surprise !
Ravie de vous revoir.
Le spectacle va commencer.
Asseyez-vous.
Je suis intrigué.
Ca doit valoir la peine.
Et comment, monsieur !
Une bagarre de gangs ?
- Prends ça !
- C'est Phil ?
lls vont s'entre-tuer.
Tant mieux !
Tu viens me menacer ?
T'as pas le choix.
T'es d'accord ou tu crčves.
C'est sensationnel.
Approche, qu'on entende.
Je suis pas couvert, imbécile.
Je me tire.
T'en va pas.
Tu raterais le scoop.
A moins que ce soit toi,
le scoop.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
Jarod, viens m'aider !
C'est super, continue.
Regardez ça, les mecs.
Pręt ŕ arroser toute la ville ?
Prépare-toi, Seattle.
On fait quoi
de cet enfoiré de Blanc ?
On le plante sur place.
C'est pareil
sur toutes les chaînes.
ll se passe quelque chose.
Ca va ętre génial.
Fais-les parler, Phil.
ll va me tirer dessus.
Comme Ken watanabe ?
Jarod, descends !
Tu passes ŕ l'acte ?
Parce que sinon...
Vous pouvez pas me descendre.
La caméra de la télé vous filme.
Une caméra peut
faire des merveilles.
Mais celle de Ken watanabe
ne l'a pas protégé.
Je ne savais pas
que ça péterait.
Mais tu savais qu'il y aurait
un gang rival. Tu l'avais appelé.
C'est pourquoi
tu avais un gilet pare-balles.
Je les ai appelés.
Tu as mis Ken en danger,
mais tu t'en fichais,
tu voulais un scoop.
- Viens m'aider !
- Je ne peux pas, Phil.
ll faut faire de l'audience.
Comme tu disais,
si ça saigne, ça baigne !
Je l'ai piégé, c'est vrai !
T'as ce que tu voulais,
mon pote ?
C'est de la balle.
J'ai tout ce qu'il faut.
Merci.
''Je l'ai piégé !''
C'était le scoop du sičcle.
Jarod Crane, pour Channel 43.
Je vous tiens pour responsable,
M. Rockwell.
Peu importent les obligations
de cette chaîne,
vous avez gâché une vie.
- Monsieur...
- lnutile.
Vous voulez un scoop ?
Vous ętes viré.
C'est pas possible.
Broots ! Espčce de crétin !
En bas !
Réveillez-vous.
Ca va ?
Vous devez avoir faim.
On s'en fout.
Personne fume, ici ?
Je peux... merci.
Heureusement
que je vous ai trouvés.
Sinon, vous étiez cuits.
N'espérez pas
que je vous remercie, Broots.
De quoi vous avez parlé,
tout ce temps ?
De rien.
Rien du tout.
Y a pas de quoi.
C'est génial.
Comment vous remercier ?
Vous me faites un harnais,
me rendez mon boulot ŕ la télé.
Promettez-moi
de ne pas diffuser ça.
C'est promis.
Envoyez-moi la cassette.
Ca se fait, non ?
- Bonne chance.
- Prenez soin de vous.
On vous couvre, Jarod.
Vous risquez de battre le record.
Ce serait un scoop, non ?

Je n'y vois rien.
Je dois descendre plus bas.
Tu es au-dessus de l'enfant.
Ca va s'ķcrouler.
ArrĻte.
Je peux le sauver, Sydney !
ArrĻte tout !
Tu es mort.
- J'aurais pu le faire.
- Le sauver ?
Tu ne peux pas
sauver tout le monde.
Jarod Halstrom.
Le chercheur le plus cool
qu'on ait eu.
ll avait une bourse,
l'universitķ louait le labo.
ll me donnait plein de sous.
- Vous recherchiez quoi ?
- Nada.
ll mangeait des Pez
et jouait avec les souris.
Les vivantes, en tout cas.
La moitiķ ķtaient mortes
ou dans le coma.
ll leur injectait quelque chose
et les observait des heures.
Un peu zarbi.
ll les a donnķes Ó l'ķcole.
Sauf une souris blanche.
ll l'appelait Jacob.
Rien.
Jarod le trimbalait
partout,
comme son meilleur ami.
Ce sont des cousins ķloignķs.
Je dois rķpondre.
Pas de pompier mort,
ni de cameraman blessķ.
ll doit s'ennuyer.
Le monde n'ennuiera jamais Jarod.
ll veut sauver des vies.
On a une jeune femme.
Jambe et vertĶbre cassķes,
hķmorragie interne.
On l'a mise sous l.V.
de solution saline.
Elle fibrille !
Restez avec moi !
Restez avec moi !
Mlle Parker, vous avez vu Sydney ?
J'ai l'air d'une laisse ?
ll est absent.
Sydney est absent
quand il est ici.
ll n'est pas venu
au labo de simu.
ll a laissķ 4 paires de jumeaux
se tourner les 16 pouces.
Sydney raterait
8 serre-livres humains ?
La sķcuritķ
a constatķ un vol Ó la pharmacie.
Une infirmiĶre a vu Sydney
partir t¶t ce matin.
A plus tard.
Votre fille a besoin de vous.
Trauma 5.
- Elle a une fille !
- On s'en occupe.
- Elle a une fille !
- Emmenez-la.
On y va.
Je reste un moment.
On va l'opķrer.
Je veux m'assurer
qu'elle va bien.
Je fais ķquipe avec toi
depuis 15 jours.
Crois-moi, tu t'investis trop.
Tu perds de l'ķnergie
pour sauver les autres.
On fait ce qu'on peut pour eux
et on passe Ó autre chose.
Dis-toi ńa
ou ce boulot te tuera.
Pas si je le fais avant.
Je n'ai pas de rapport
pour vos 5 derniĶres livraisons.
- ''Livraisons'' ?
- Dr Fletcher, Jarod Randolph.
ll sait mieux conduire
que remplir ses papiers ?
Je vous apporte les papiers
dĶs que j'ai un moment.
Vous avez intķrĻt.
Sydney a fait un sacrķ larcin.
Testostķrone, triphķnylmide...
Diflutazķnil.
Anabolisant, neurostimulant
et antidķpresseur.
Super, Sydney chez les junkies
et pas de trace de Jarod.
Dķcryptez ses fichiers.
Cherchez un indice.
Vous envahissez mon espace.
Tout prĶs, c'est bien.
Tu as accrochķ un membre
d'animal au rķtroviseur.
Une patte de lapin.
La patte avant.
T'en as jamais vu ?
- Ca porte bonheur.
- Pas au lapin.
C'est l'heure du cafķ.
Faites moins de bruit.
J'essaie de dormir.
Tu te reposerais mieux
en baissant la musique.
C'est de l'auto-hypnose.
J'apprends en dormant.
Une revue mķdicale ?
Je suis impressionnķ.
Dis-le aux examinateurs
Ó Atlanta.
J'arrĻte les ambulances
cet automne, si j'ai de la chance.
Essaie la patte de lapin.
Je prķfĶre le trĶfle Ó 4 feuilles.
- Zut, Vargas est lÓ.
- Qui est Vargas ?
Max Vargas, l'inspecteur.
ll devait pas venir

ll est plus chiant
que les cadres de l'hosto.
Vous parlez de ceux
qui m'ont rķclamķ
vos papiers ?
Vous devez Ļtre Randolph.
Ca fait quoi, d'Ļtre riche ?
- Pardon ?
- Depuis un mois,
vous n'avez pas rempli
votre dossier.
Vous devez avoir
des ķconomies.
S¹rement un oubli.
C'est mon boulot
d'y remķdier.
Allons dans mon bureau
remplir ce dossier
pour mettre un peu d'ordre.
Jarod et moi
faisions notre pause cafķ
syndicale.
Ce sera une pause papiers.
Je vous les apporte
demain matin.
Je compte sur vous.
C'est gentil de lui parler, Sydney.
Les gens croient
qu'ils n'entendent pas.
ll doit savoir
qu'il n'est pas seul.
Jacob,
j'ai dķcouvert
une recherche expķrimentale.
La technique Halstrom.
Jarod me l'a envoyķe.
C'est incertain,

Je t'ai promis

''Alors que Sydney Carton
''et les prisonniers

''parlant Ó voix basse,
''M. Lowry regarda Jerry

C'est un courtier d'Alfareta.
Jerry Mitchell.
Queen of Mercy ? Unitķ 45.
On a un homme de 50 ans.
Peut-Ļtre un traumatisme crŌnien.
Le County est plus prĶs.
lls sont meilleurs
Ó Queen of Mercy.
- Cet homme a besoin...
- Stabilise-le.
Je conduis.
ll aurait pu Ļtre soignķ
depuis 8 mn.
Notre courtier est
en de bonnes mains. Ca vaut 8 mn.
J'espĶre.
J'ai fait un choix.
Un problĶme ?
Non, pas de problĶme.
Rien de frappant
dans les e-mails de Sydney.
Tous ses appels
sont liķs au Centre.
MĻme pas le tķlķphone rose
pour se dķtendre.
Et son courrier ?
Revues mķdicales,
magazines de jardinage...
- Journal littķraire.
- Donnez.
Donation annuelle
pour Mount Pleasant.
Une sociķtķ historique ?
ll va toujours lÓ-bas Ó Noļl.
Dr Corey,
je vous dois des excuses.
Les urgences,
c'est votre boulot.
Vous bilez pas.
Vous avez bon coeur.
Au fait,
la jeune mĶre va s'en tirer.
C'est merveilleux.
C'est rare,
un ambulancier si impliquķ.
C'est plus fort que moi.
Je me mets Ó la place
de mes patients.
- Je connais ńa.
- D'o∙ votre intķrĻt pour Steven ?
D'habitude,
j'arrive Ó stabiliser le patient.
Mais celui-ci...
J'ai tout essayķ
et pourtant il m'ķchappe.
Steven a de la chance
d'avoir un mķdecin
si attentionnķ.
Ca va ?
On ne les aide pas toujours assez.
Je n'aime pas ńa.
Ca fait partie du mķtier.
Ca ne facilite pas les choses.
Vous ne comptez pas
aller ailleurs ?
ll y a un poste
de chercheur Ó Cornell.
Les souris, ce sera plus facile.
N'en soyez pas si s¹re.
Je vous en prie,
rķflķchissez bien.
Cet h¶pital a besoin
de gens comme vous.
''C'est une bien meilleure action
''que mes actions passķes.
''C'est un bien meilleur repos
''que je vais go¹ter.''
On fait une pause
avant le prochain ?
ll aime Dickens.
ll est plein d'espoir.
MĻme quand c'est triste,
c'est ķdifiant.
Voici du chocolat.
Nous apprķcions vos visites.
Vous voyez assez de malades
- dans votre mķtier.
- On a besoin de bķnķvoles.
Comment va Steven ?
ll a dķmarrķ
la thķrapie Treathwell.
Dķcouverte Ó Yale,
elle libĶre
des neurostimulants
dans l'hypothalamus.
J'ai un ami dans le coma.
ll y a 20% de rķussite.
- 1 sur 5 sort du coma.
- Et 4 n'en sortent pas.
ll a le profil.
D'aprĶs eux,
si quelqu'un
accepte le traitement,
Steven l'acceptera.
C'est un battant.
Je peux ?
ll faisait de la lutte ?
ll est allķ en finale
du championnat.
Chaque fois, il ķtait menķ,
mais il est revenu
et il a gagnķ.
Vous devez Ļtre fiers.
ll ne renonńait jamais.
On l'encourageait.
Je crois que ńa l'aidait

Je ne connais pas

Bon chocolat.

J'ai intķrĻt.
Je vais m'endetter de 100 000$.
Tiens, l'homme invisible !
Je vais...

J'ai ķtudiķ votre dossier.
Non seulement
je n'ai aucune fiche de paie,

Pour moi, vous n'existez pas.
Je veux votre nom,

Tu es absent depuis 3 jours.
Je ne peux plus te couvrir.
J'avais des affaires

Des secrets ?
Notre travail me pose

ArrĻte.
On ne fait rien de mal.
Ouvre les yeux, Sydney.
lls sont ouverts. On s'est toujours

Oublie ta carriĶre une seconde.
Je parle des enfants.
Sydney... Une amķlioration ?
La technique Halstrom est gķniale.
Ca peut aider beaucoup de gens.
Un seul Ó la fois.
Comment va Jacob ?
C'est encore trop t¶t.
Pourquoi fais-tu ńa ?
Un mķdecin,
ńa soulage la douleur,
vous vous rappelez ?
Salut Jacob.
T'as passķ une bonne journķe ?
Je vķrifiais
l'assurance du courtier d'hier.
On l'a expķdiķ au County.
Vous Ļtes pas les as

Le budget a ķtķ rķduit d'un tiers

Tenez-vous au courant.
Elle a un problĶme ?
Elle est comme vous,
trop sensible.
Vivement jeudi !
Pourquoi ?
J'ai ma mutation.
Fini, les urgences.
On a besoin de vous.
J'en ai parlķ
Ó tous mes amis.
Je saluerai les souris

Qui est M. X ?
Ca ne vous regarde pas.
Ce qui vous regarde

Jarod peut attendre.
Moi, pas.
Faites vos valises.
Vous venez avec moi.
Vous n'avez rien Ó faire ici.
Je n'ai qu'Ó appeler
les nettoyeurs.
J'ai des prioritķs.
Qui ķtait de garde, cette nuit ?
Quelqu'un est venu.
Qui ķtait de garde ?
Consultez vos dossiers.
Ca n'y est pas.
Qu'avez-vous perdu ?
Des dossiers personnels,

Je me retaperai pas

Ce sera inutile,

ķcole primaire de Millbrook...
Mķmoire visuelle.
Et j'en ai assez lÓ-dedans
pour vķrifier vos antķcķdents.
J'ai envie de faire pķdiatrie.
A ton avis ?
A mon avis,
un mķdecin doit avoir une ķthique.
Quoi ?
O∙ est-ce qu'on va ?
J'essaie un autre itinķraire.
Du gymnase de Peachtree
Ó l'h¶pital Queen of Mercy.
Curieux, il y a deux h¶pitaux
bien plus proches
que le Queen of Mercy.
De quoi tu parles ?
D'ķthique.
Steven Chambers a ķtķ blessķ
lors d'un match.
Rennert et vous l'avez conduit
jusqu'Ó Queen of Mercy.
Pourquoi un ambulancier chevronnķ
a fait un tel dķtour ?
Jarod, on a fait ce qu'on a pu.
D'aprĶs mes calculs,
il faut 25 mn
pour aller au Queen of Mercy.
Qu'avez-vous fait pour lui ?
Vous l'avez regardķ
s'enfoncer ?
C'est Rennert qui a dķcidķ.
J'ai consultķ son dossier
sur 5 ans.
ll a conduit Ó Queen of Mercy
au moins 30 patients
qui auraient d¹ aller ailleurs.
30 patients nķcessitant
des soins co¹teux
couverts par l'assurance.
Combien d'autres ont fini
comme Steven Chambers ?
Un mķdecin
doit avoir une ķthique.
ll a des vies entre les mains.
Les Hawks jouaient ce soir-lÓ.
On s'est payķ un bouchon.
On ķtait coincķs lÓ...
J'ai parlķ Ó Steven,
essayant de le tenir ķveillķ,
et Rennert me rķpķtait
qu'on avait bien fait.
Tu aurais pu porter plainte.
C'ķtait ma premiĶre semaine.
C'ķtait dķjÓ dur
de lui dire qu'on se trompait.
Rennert m'a dit
de ne plus jamais le contredire.
Je ne voulais pas d'ennuis.
Je veux juste aider les gens.
O∙ sont-ils ?
Qui ?
Je ne sais pas trop.
Je sais peut-Ļtre
o∙ je crois qu'ils sont.
Dites-moi.
lls n'ont pas ķtķ prķcis.
lls n'ont...
pas dit grand-chose.
Votre petite fille va bien ?
Vous savez,
ils ont dit quelque chose
Ó propos de Mount Pleasant.
Sydney y va parfois.
Je sais o∙ il va.
J'ai augmentķ la dose.
C'est le triple
de ce que vous aviez demandķ.
Je n'imaginais pas.
Peu de gens le savent.
Comment c'est arrivķ ?
Je parle des enfants.
Qu'est-ce qui te tracasse ?
Comment on les a eus.
Je sais ce que je dois savoir.
Ce que le Centre
veut bien te dire.
Tu fais toujours ńa,
tu ķvacues ce qui ne colle pas
Ó ton idķal.
Et toi, tu t'empoisonnes la vie.
C'ķtait ma faute.
Je connaissais la route,
chaque virage.
Ca aurait pu arriver
Ó n'importe qui.
Jarod a fait une simulation
qui a prouvķ que non.
Je devrais Ļtre dans ce lit.
Jacob, tu m'entends ?
''Je ne te laisserai pas
partir ainsi.
''ll le faut, madame,
rķpondit la fille en se levant.
''Vous me laisserez partir
car je vous ai fait confiance.''
J'ai hŌte de savoir
comment finit l'histoire.
Pour le mieux.
Voici du cafķ.
ll ne se rķveillera pas.
Ne dites pas ńa.
J'ai perdu espoir.
Richard aussi, sans l'admettre.
Vous pouvez encore essayer.
La thķrapie...
Un ķchec.
Le traitement est arrivķ Ó terme.
MĻme en augmentant les doses ?
Augmenter, diminuer, diluer,
rien ne marche.
ll y a un autre traitement.
La technique Halstrom.
Ne renoncez pas.
Steven s'est tellement battu.
Un garńon de Cleveland
a besoin d'un coeur.
On essaie de prendre
une dķcision.
ll faudrait un miracle.
Au cas o∙, je veux finir
cette histoire,
qu'il connaisse la fin.
''A quoi serviront en ce cas
vos rķvķlations ?
''ll faut qu'on ķclaircisse
ce mystĶre.''
Je peux le sauver !
- ArrĻte tout !
- Je peux le sauver !
Tu ne peux sauver
tout le monde.
Je devais essayer.
La technique Halstrom...
Elle est dķfectueuse.
L'effet n'est que temporaire.
Merci, Jarod.
J'ai essayķ de venir
le plus souvent possible,
mais mon travail
m'occupe beaucoup.
Tu me manques.
Etais-tu conscient,
tout ce temps ?
La nuit de l'accident,
ńa me hante.
Je t'ai promis de tout faire
pour te sortir du coma.
Tu ne devrais pas Ļtre ici.
Tu ne l'as pas mķritķ.
SL...
...27 ?
Pourquoi on ne m'a rien dit ?
Ca ne vous concerne pas.
- Ca concerne le Centre.
- ll est rķveillķ ?
Rķpondez-moi.
Vous, rķpondez-moi.
- ll est rķveillķ.
- ll parle ?
Pas encore.
Ne le laissez pas parler.
Jacob menace
les intķrĻts du Centre.
Vous Ļtes dans l'obligation
de protķger ces intķrĻts.
Cela vous pose-t-il un problĶme ?
- Non, monsieur.
- Des nettoyeurs
viendront s'en assurer.
Faites en sorte que Jacob
ne se rķveille plus jamais.
Encore des vies Ó sauver !
Je souhaite voir M. Randolph
en tĻte-Ó-tĻte.
On partait bosser.
Nous devons ķclaircir
deux ou trois choses avant.
J'ai vķrifiķ
vos antķcķdents
malgrķ l'absence de dossier.
J'en ai tirķ
des donnķes intķressantes.
Le seul Jarod Randolph rķpertoriķ

ll est temps
de jouer cartes sur table.
Je ne sais mĻme pas

Malgrķ les appels ķlogieux

je dois m'assurer que les patients
sont en de bonnes mains.
Ma chance a tournķ.
Je veux une raison
de pas appeler les flics.
J'ai appris

ll a ķcrit un mot avant.
Je suis contente pour vous.
Pas ta faute
On m'a bipķe ?
C'ķtait moi, Dr Corey.
Tenez.
C'est quoi ?
De la part de Jarod.
On peut attaquer Rennert

On va au Queen of Mercy.

Tiens-le en vie

Qu'est-ce que tu fais lÓ ?
C'est le prix d'une vie ?
De quoi s'agit-il ?
De vous et de cet ambulancier

D'un jeune homme dans le coma.
Steven Chambers

Sa vie t'importait peu.
Ce que tu voulais,
c'ķtait cette enveloppe.
C'est un coup montķ.
C'est injuste.
C'est injuste que ses parents

Je m'en vais.

Vous aviez raison, Sydney.

On atterrit dans 15 secondes.
Du nouveau ?
Depuis qu'il a replongķ

C'est injuste.
Quoi donc ?
Des gens se battent

Suffisamment.

Vu dans Le Caméléon :
- Maman !
- lls lui font mal !
Ramenez Jarod.
Mon père
veut que je m'en charge.
Je n'ai pas peur de votre père.
Je crois que ma mère
a sauvé ces enfants.
Gator Heaven est le paradis
du dressage d'alligators.
On produit plus de champions
que n'importe quel autre endroit.
C'est Jarod ?
ll a appris le métier
en quelques jours !
Un vrai Tarzan.
ll leur donnait des surnoms.
La plus féroce
était Mlle Parker.
ll est parti.
ll a laissé un cahier rouge ?
Mieux que ça.
- C'est pour vous.
- Magnifique.
Fait main par des indigènes.
A Taiwan ?
Une tribu orientale.
Parfait, Jarod. Encore un jeu.
Si vous la voulez,
il faut signer.
Jarod vous offre aussi le stylo.
Le voilà.
Venez, mon vieux.
ll faut évacuer
ce sac à main
avant le cyclone.
- ll ne va pas tarder.
- On a quelques heures.
Difficile à croire,
par une si belle journée.
Je peux m'en occuper.
De l'alligator ?
Vous êtes fou ?
J'ai travaillé
avec les Séminoles.
- En Floride ?
- Non, la tribu.
Viens, ma fille.
Comment vous savez
que c'est une femelle ?
A son sourire.
Mlle Parker, veuillez me suivre.
Papa, la prochaine fois,
évite le comité d'accueil.
C'est moi qui vous ai fait venir,
pas votre père.
Vous avez été occupée.
Je ne vous suis pas.
C'est moi qui vous suis.
Qu'y avait-il
dans le coffre ?
Rien, monsieur.
Laissez-moi
reformuler ma question.
Je sais que c'était
le coffre de maman.
Qu'avez-vous trouvé dedans ?
Je cherchais des réponses.
A quel sujet ?
La façon dont elle est morte.
Ta mère s'est tuée.
Laissez-nous, M. Raines.
Tu ne m'embrasses pas ?
Ca fait trop longtemps.
Comment ça va,
au pavillon d'été ?
Les feuilles reviennent ?
Doucement.
Tu connais le printemps là-bas.
Tu es têtue.
Ta mère s'impatientait toujours.
Je ne m'en souviens pas.
Mais je me souviens de ça.
Tu lui ressembles.
A te regarder,
on croirait
qu'elle est toujours là.
Je veux savoir
ce qui lui est arrivé.
Tu me déçois.
Je te déçois ?
Ne me dis pas que tu y crois !
Je me rappelle ce jour-là
et votre dispute.
Peu après, elle est morte.
Maîtrise tes émotions.
Je t'ai appris à le faire.
Dis-moi seulement
ce qui s'est passé.
Je l'ai tuée.
Je me torture
à vouloir m'en persuader.
Quand un être cher
se suicide,
on cherche des réponses
à ce mystère.
C'est ce que tu fais.
Elle me manque.
Tu étais jeune, tu ignorais
ce qu'elle éprouvait.
C'était une triste époque.
Je ne comprends pas son geste.
Tu ne crois pas
qu'elle me manque aussi ?
Bien sûr.
Tu peux me croire
ou croire Jarod. Choisis.
Je veux une nouvelle mission.
Jarod est l'affaire
de Sydney et M. Raines.
Redonne-moi mon poste.
On a un accord.
Je sais.
Tu étais une enfant
calme et hésitante.
Voilà que tu as cette...
présence.
ll est temps
que mon trésor brille.
Je sais de quoi tu es capable.
Vraiment ?
Oui.
Et notre marché tient toujours.
La Floride ? J'y étais hier.
Oui, mais pas assez au sud.
En votre absence,
Broots et moi avons relu
le vieux cahier
d'Atlanta.
On a trouvé des indices.
Des coordonnées écrites
à l'intérieur nous mènent au...
Au cyclone Cassandra.
Des vents
de 240 km/h.
Quand Jarod était à Atlanta,
Cassandra n'était
qu'une dépression tropicale.
ll devait savoir.
Jarod s'est mis
sur la route du cyclone ?
Un membre de la patrouille
de Bahia Grande
se sert du code d'accès du Centre
au satellite météo.
J'utilise le même.
Broots à l'appareil.
Bien, monsieur, tout de suite.
C'est pour vous.
Bien sûr.
Très clair.
Alors ?
C'est personnel.
On peut y aller ?
Ca prendrait 2 h, mais les gens
commencent à être évacués.
Alors, j'irai avec Sam.
C'est risqué.
Si Jarod est déjà sur cette île,
je l'aurai.
Qui a appelé ?
M. Raines.
Réfugiés haïtiens dans la tempête
Des Haïtiens accusent un policier
Officier acquitté
par manque de preuves
Une fille de réfugiés retrouvée
Les habitants de Bahia Grande
barricadent leurs fenêtres
et remplissent leurs voitures.
On attend Cassandra
d'ici 4 à 5 heures, vers 19 h.
Je dois sortir.
Ne t'inquiète pas, Simone,
on va te soigner.
- On ferme les écoutilles ?
- Ecoutez,
je vais vendre cet endroit
et m'installer en Oklahoma.
Et les tornades ?
- Alors, en Californie.
- Et les séismes ?
N'importe où, mais ailleurs.
Comment elle va ?
La fièvre ne tombe pas.
ll faut vous dépêcher.
Vous auriez dû laisser Simone
dans ce centre !
On l'aurait renvoyée à Haïti.
Bartlett n'aurait pas
laissé mourir ses parents.
L'argent peut tout faire faire.
Je veillerai
à ce qu'il soit payé.
Oubliez-le.
Venez avec nous.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Je ne suis pas doué
avec les malades.
J'ai vu mon père
mourir d'une attaque.
ll fallait le réanimer
et j'étais pétrifié.
Je l'ai regardé partir.
Je refuse cette responsabilité.
L'analgésique la soulagera.
Conduisez-la à Miami.
Les médecins
se chargeront d'elle.
Vous en êtes capable.
Je vous fais confiance.
Si vous le dites.
ll est vide.
Plus de bonbons.
Ordre du médecin.
Tu en auras d'autres.
Dès qu'on verra ta famille
à Miami.
C'est promis.
A très bientôt.
Vous pouvez m'aider ?
lmpossible.
La police a du nouveau.
Les parents de la fillette
sont morts à Harrison Marsh.
La police veut des preuves.
Faites voir.
- Je m'en occupe.
- Je viens avec vous.
Je peux me débrouiller.
Fractures multiples
Lacération mineure
Pouce gauche cassé
Fracture de la clavicule
Ca fait mal !
Plus vite !
On part dans quelques minutes.
Bon sang, vous m'avez fait peur !
Désolé.
C'est quoi, ça ?
Ne restez pas là, coupez ça.
Le couper ?
Le faire m'a pris trop de temps.
Vous avez fait ce filet ?
Considérez-le comme un sac...
un sac-poubelle.
Sortez-moi de là
ou je vous bute !
On passe souvent de la drogue
ou des voitures en contrebande.
Vite !
Vous, vous vendez des vies.
Vous faites passer des Haïtiens
et leur famille doit payer.
Une fois qu'ils sont là,
le prix monte.
C'est du rançonnage pur et simple.
S'ils ne paient pas,
ils meurent dans une tempête.
Comme celle qui arrive...
Vous n'avez aucune preuve.
J'ai tout envoyé au ministère.
La famille de Simone voulait
commencer une nouvelle vie.
Mais vous la leur avez volée.
Cette petite fille
n'a plus ses parents
parce que
vous les avez laissés mourir.
Leur abri s'est effondré,
ils se sont jetés sur leur fille.
lls sont morts pour la sauver !
Vous savez ce que c'est,
de grandir sans ses parents ?
Attendez, mon vieux !
Le cyclone va me tuer !
Mais non.
Vous êtes à 5 km au nord
de la trajectoire.
Du moins, je crois...
mon vieux.
Me laissez pas là !
Message à caractère urgent.
Le cyclone Cassandra approche
de la côte est de l'île.
Le vent souffle à 240 km/h.
L'évacuation de Bahia Grande
est finie.
Les habitants restants doivent
se réfugier dans un centre...
Désolé.
- Pourquoi ?
- ll y a du bon et du mauvais.
Le pont est inondé, le courant
et le téléphone sont coupés.
On est bloqués ici.
Et la bonne nouvelle ?
C'était la bonne nouvelle.
Le pilote a été évacué. ll a perdu
le contact avec Mlle Parker.
Merci de nous avoir choisis...
Ca y est.
Notre sujet principal
est Cassandra
dont les vents atteignent
maintenant 280 km/h.
Cassandra a viré de 30°
et il semble que Bahia Grande
sera sa cible.
Cassandra
ne connaît pas Mlle Parker.
Pourvu qu'ils aillent bien.
Après toutes ces impasses,
il me fallait l'aide de Cassandra.
Aux femmes. Et à l'enfer.
C'est mauvais pour ton ulcère.
Tu l'es aussi.
Ne sous-estime pas Cassandra.
Les vents atteignent sûrement 280Km/h
Cet endroit tiendra le coup.
Au cas où tu te tromperais...
dis-moi qui sont mes parents.
Dis-moi qui je suis.
Je devrais d'abord t'envoyer
dans chaque auberge de jeunesse.
Ou t'enfermer dans un motel
avec Sydney et Broots.
Tu parles de Las Vegas, hein ?
Tu me tiens.
Pourquoi tu ne me dis pas tout ?
Tu as gaspillé ton temps
à défendre les opprimés.
Je n'ai pas gaspillé ma liberté.
Tu dressais des alligators !
Tu as le rapport médical.
J'ai ce que tu as oublié.
Tu ne veux pas seulement
me récupérer.
Tu veux des réponses.
J'ai tout ce dont j'ai besoin.
Papa va être ravi.
Mais papa ne te donne pas
ce que tu veux.
Qu'est-ce que papa t'a dit
sur ta mère
et son suicide ?
Ca suffit !
Sûrement pas la vérité.
La vérité, c'est que tu mens.
Tu as toujours menti.
Tu as falsifié ce rapport.
Jamais je n'aurais fait ça.
Je ne voulais pas te le dire.
Mais j'avais la clé de ton passé.
Bien tenté !
Tu contrôles tellement
la situation !
Tu mènes le jeu !
Plus maintenant.
Maintenant,
c'est moi qui commande.
Tiens bon.
Ma petite...
Ca t'a rapporté
plein de médailles ?
Sauver des enfants
n'est pas une bonne idée ?
Ta mère aurait approuvé.
La 1re offensive est passée.
L'oeil va arriver
dans 17 minutes.
C'est le pire.
Elle s'est évanouie !
- Laisse-moi l'examiner.
- Sam va le faire.
Sam n'est pas médecin.
Je peux le devenir.
C'est moi.
Parle-moi.
Au cas où, tirez dans le pied.
Simone, tu m'entends ?
Pitié !
Ca fait mal !
Elle est inconsciente.
ll faut faire tomber la fièvre.
L'infection se propage.
Elle a besoin de pénicilline.
- ll y en a dans le hangar.
- A l'autre bout de l'île ?
Quand tu partiras pour Blue Cove,
je veillerai
à ce qu'on la soigne.
On n'a pas le temps.
Elle risque le choc septique
ou le coma.
L'oeil va arriver.
Ca nous laisse 20 minutes.
Comment vous savez ?
Jarod faisait la météo
à Porto Rico.
Que dit-elle ?
Elle cherche le ciel.
En mourant, sa mère a dit
qu'elle veillerait sur elle
dans le ciel,
que le soleil et la lune
seraient ses yeux.
Je vais au hangar.
Tu vas la laisser mourir ?
Les menottes.
Je t'accompagne.
Surveillez sa température.
Je compte sur vous.
Elle aussi.
Tu as bien agi.
Appelle-moi mère Teresa.
Ca ne te va pas.
Quoi ?
Cet air que tu te donnes.
Tu essaies d'imiter ton père,
mais tu es différente.
Ca n'est pas personnel.
- Quoi que tu fasses.
- Pour moi, c'est personnel.
Alors,
laisse ma mère en dehors de ça.
Elle a voulu me sauver.
Et maintenant ?
On est à un kilomètre.
En se dépêchant,
on peut y arriver.
Ce sera plus facile sans ça.
- Attention ou je vise le genou.
- Je croyais que c'était le pied.
La fièvre ne tombe pas.
Allons, ma puce.
Aide-moi.
Pourquoi traquer Jarod ?
Ferme-la et surveille la gosse.
Je manque de glace.
Je vais en chercher.
Pourquoi c'est si long ?
Ca y est.
Simone va s'en sortir.
Je suis là !
Cassandra souffle à 260 km/h.
Vous avez de ses nouvelles ?
Non, je suis inquiet.
- Moi aussi.
- Vraiment ?
C'est M. Raines qui l'a envoyée.
M. Raines vous pose problème ?
ll est incontrôlable.
Non, c'est Jarod qui l'est.
ll ment à ma fille sur sa mère.
- ll ment ?
- Vous l'avez vue.
Vous connaissiez son état.
Sa seule issue
était le suicide.
Mme Parker,
qu'elle repose en paix,
était maniaco-dépressive.
Son mariage tombait en morceaux
et de plus, elle était battue.
Qu'a-t-elle dit à ce sujet ?
Je ne peux pas le révéler.
Mais vous connaissez
les psychiatres, ils notent tout.
Moi aussi.
Votre femme était ma patiente.
Le contenu de ses séances
est confidentiel.
C'est moi qui décide, Sydney.
J'en suis conscient.
Autre chose, docteur ?
La corde était résistante.
Elle vous a coûté une molaire.
Deux. La ferme !
Tu n'as jamais nettoyé
derrière toi.
Tu aurais dû voir
le flic de Miami !
Quel chialeur !
Vos gueules !
Crâne d'oeuf !
Le Centre vous paiera...
Silence !
Je m'en fous !
Dès que la tempête sera passée,
on fera un petit tour de bateau.
Mais je reviendrai seul.
Ce soir, vous dormez
avec les lamantins.
Elle ne garde aucune nourriture.
Un jus de fruits
lui fera du bien.
Vous m'avez fait peur !
Ne perds pas de temps.
Ta croisade pour les faibles
a des ratés.
Affronte les conséquences !
J'ai passé ma vie
à simuler la réalité.
Les conséquences
me semblent légères.
Tu as dit que ma mère
voulait te sauver...
Elle voulait
me faire sortir du Centre.
Tu faisais partie
de ses protégés ?
Elle est morte
avant de pouvoir nous sauver.
Nous ?
Elle avait une liste
de sept enfants.
Les malchanceux.
Où as-tu trouvé cette liste ?
ll n'y avait pas
que le rapport médical
dans le coffre.
Le rapport médical est vrai.
Mes parents se disputaient.
Elle touchait le fond.
Elle ne portait plus
son alliance.
C'était un dur moment
pour mon père.
Comment peux-tu le croire ?
Je ne l'ai jamais vu la frapper.
Jamais.
Je n'ai jamais vu personne.
Pas que je me souvienne...
On refoule ses souvenirs.
Surtout les traumatiques.
A moins que quelque chose
ne les réveille. Une odeur...
un son...
J'ai vendu des cassettes pour
la mémoire. Ca a dû t'échapper.
- Laisse-moi t'aider.
- Merci de ton offre,
mais je peux me débrouiller.
Si vous êtes si inquiet
pour elle,
vous auriez dû l'accompagner.
Elle est partie
parce que vous l'avez menacée.
Mlle Parker fait son travail.
Je suis content
que quelqu'un le fasse.
Que vous est-il arrivé ?
Trop de cigarettes,
pas assez de vacances.
Quand vous étiez le Dr Raines,
vous étiez mon collègue,
je n'ai jamais décelé cette...
obsession.
Je n'ai plus à obéir
au serment d'Hippocrate.
Ma seule priorité
est de récupérer Jarod.
Pour cela,
Mlle Parker
a besoin de concentration.
Elle a beaucoup
de questions en tête.
Elle a toujours été curieuse.
Comme sa mère.
Selon la météo,
l'oeil est passé...
On peut y être
d'ici demain matin.
Prenez un jet.
Allons, Broots.
On ne veut pas qu'il arrive
malheur à Mlle Parker.
Voilà...
Une mandarine,
un peu de citron.
Ca met du baume au coeur.
Mais tu es encore brûlante.
Dépêchez-vous, Jarod !
- Où tu vas ?
- Refaire du jus.
Tu cherches ça ?
C'est le moment
de faire un tour de bateau.
Honneur aux dames.
Lâchez Ca !
Un pistolet d'alarme !
Ca peut donner
des brûlures d'estomac !
D'où tu sors ça ?
Je l'ai pris
pendant que tu ne regardais pas.
Tu comptais me menacer ?
J'y compte toujours.
Essayez de ronger ça.
ll va falloir être très souple
pour te sortir de là.
Pourquoi tu m'as sauvé la vie ?
Parce que je me souviens encore
de la petite fille
qui m'a donné
mon premier baiser.
Maman !
Ce n'est rien, chérie.
Maman va bien.
M. Raines !
- Quoi ?
- Vous n'avez pas
un double de la clé
de cette cage ?
Si.
Dans le cendrier, sur le bureau.
Le tout est de l'atteindre.
On veut tous les deux Jarod.
Alors,
faites avancer la cage.
Aidez-moi à l'attraper
et je veillerai
à ce que vous ayez
une jolie récompense.
Du nerf !
J'aurai ma récompense quand ?
Maintenant.
Je vais atterrir.
Où est Mlle Parker ?
Où est-elle, j'ai dit ?
En rendez-vous.
Contre le mur !
Elle a besoin de ça.
Alors, Sam ?
Vous allez me tuer ?
Vous n'en avez pas le droit.
Merci.
J'aurais dû faire Ca plus tôt.
Ca va faire un peu mal.
Mais je te promets
que ça va te soulager.
La tempête est finie ?
C'est fini.
Au secours ! C'est un cinglé !
ll se prend à la fois
pour le juge et le jury !
- Où est-il ?
- Par là.
Bungalow numéro 32.
C'est tout au fond.
Prête ?
Ton papa et ta maman
peuvent te voir, maintenant.
J'étais tout près.
Et j'ai appris certaines choses.
Le statu quo tient toujours ?
On a un accord,
mais pas de statu quo.
Comment ça ?
Plus de surveillance.
Plus de détecteurs de mensonges,
plus de jeux.
Réessayez de me prendre de court
et je détruis
votre réservoir d'oxygène.
On vous nettoiera
à la pince à épiler.
J'attrape Jarod à ma façon.
Et une fois qu'il est au Centre,
je m'en vais.
Voilà le marché.
C'est clair ?
Comme de l'eau de roche.
A plus tard, papa.
Content que tu sois de retour.
Ma fille chérie,
cette bague
était à ton arrière-grand-mère.
S'il m'arrive malheur,
elle est à toi. Tu auras
peut-être plus de chance.
Maman.
Quoi ?
- Tu as reçu la bague ?
- Oui, merci, Jarod.
Tu as trouvé ta réponse ?
Je crois savoir qui a tué
ma mère, mais j'ignore pourquoi.
C'était pour les enfants.
Pour toi, Jarod.
Je pense qu'elle est morte
en essayant de te sauver.
- Tu es en colère.
- Je continuerai à te traquer.
Mais je ne traquerai plus
mon passé.
Et si c'est lui qui te traque ?
Je l'ignorerai.
- C'est toi qui commandes.
- Et j'adore ça.
Jolies bottes. Peau de serpent ?
Croco.

Vous n'avez pas fait

Bravo, Jarod.
Tu fais des progrès.

On se dépêche, Lon Chaney !
Alors, capitaine Cody !
Je suis comment ?
Seule une mère
aimerait ce visage.
Relâchez votre sphincter,
c'est moi.
Je ne vous ai pas
entendue entrer.
Comment va la fan de John Tesh ?
Bien, elle va bien.
Je la saluerai pour vous.
Quelque chose vous tracasse ?
J'ai besoin d'une faveur.
De ma part ?
Peut-on faire
une recherche sur lnternet
sans prévenir Le Centre ?
Je suppose, mais...
si on vous attrape,
on vous crucifie.
Vous voulez que je regarde
si quelqu'un l'a fait ?
Je veux que vous le fassiez
pour moi.
Non, impossible.
Je vous en prie.
Voici des enfants disparus
à la fin des années 60.
Sauvés
Noms, dates de naissance,
descriptions, photos.
Personne ne doit voir ça.
Ne scannez pas ces photos,
ne les envoyez pas sur lnternet.
Au cas où,
prévenez-moi.
Bon sang, c'est les super flics !
On sauve des mouchards et voilà
comment on est récompensés !
Des types au nez épaté
aimeraient vous trouver.
Avec le capitaine Cody,
ça ne risque pas.
Contrairement à vous,
il n'a jamais perdu de témoin.
Plus vite on en aura fini
avec vous, mieux ça vaudra.
Doucement, Lane.
Cody fait son boulot.
Allons boire un coup.
Vous êtes marrant.
J'ai raté quelque chose ?
A washington,
tous les flics en rient.
J'en ai entendu parler.
Un témoin du nom de Diggs
a disparu sous leur garde.
Dans ce milieu, ça arrive.
L'histoire n'est pas finie.
Deux semaines avant,
le complice de Diggs
poignarde Garrison
avec un couteau fait maison
et plonge de 10 000 m
pendant le transfert en avion.
Plutôt gênant pour la police.
Je pensais
que vous étiez au courant.
J'ai été occupé.
Dernières volontés
Dr Shafton, ici Sydney.
ll faut que je vous voie.
Lane !
Je sais
que c'est un peu une gifle
que je sois transféré
au milieu de l'affaire.
On se débrouillait
très bien sans vous.
Je suis juste à cran
à cause de Diggs.
Je suis là pour aider.
Je peux jeter un oeil ?
Dans 3 jours, Eugene Diggs
doit témoigner contre le cartel.
Si on ne le retrouve pas,
les caïds sont libres.
On le retrouvera.
On n'aura aucun répit avant.
S.P.A.M. ? Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
L'Amérique.
Si on n'avait pas envoyé ça
en Angleterre,
les Beatles chanteraient
en allemand.
Un insecte chantant
dans une langue, c'est fou !
Vous permettez ?
Délicieux.
On va voir la femme d'Eugene ?
ll se ronge pour tout.
Je n'arrive pas
à l'en empêcher.
Diggs et son ami Jimmy Rayford
avaient une compagnie aérienne
dans l'Arkansas.
Les affaires marchaient mal.
Jimmy passe un accord
avec les Colombiens
pour transporter
des cargaisons spéciales.
Eugene, qui lui fait confiance,
croit transporter du café.
Mais Jimmy
fait du trafic de cocaïne.
La DEA les coince.
lls doivent témoigner contre
le cartel pour réduire leur peine.
Affaire classée.
Mais Rayford vous attaque
avec un couteau en plein vol,
tente de s'échapper en parachute
et laisse Eugene en plan.
Les mauvaises nouvelles
vont vite.
A washington, on ne doit pas
être content de vous.
Ce ne sont pas les seuls.
Comment je peux parler à Eugene ?
Vous campez devant chez moi,
mon téléphone est sur écoute.
Mes amis ne viennent même plus.
On est vos seuls amis.
Vous n'aidez pas Eugene
en nous mentant.
Eugene a peur.
Selon Jimmy, les types du cartel
sont sans pitié.
Laissez-nous vous aider.
Comme vous avez aidé Rayford ?
Mme Diggs, on peut vous protéger
tous les deux
du cartel.
Je vous l'ai dit,
je ne sais rien.
ll est seul, il a peur,
il n'a plus d'amis.
A qui peut-il se fier ?
La jeune épouse
se retrouve seule...
De vieux amis s'attaquent
au cartel de la drogue
ll faut que tu finisses
la simulation.
Je veux voir l'autre garçon.
Tu ne peux avoir aucun contact.
Alors, je ne finis pas
la simulation.
Pourquoi ?
Comment ?
Je n'ai jamais eu d'ami !
Tu as simulé des choses
que tu ignorais.
Je veux voir l'autre garçon.
Je veux savoir ce qu'est un ami.
Garrison à l'appareil.
On a eu l'avocate de Diggs.
Eugene veut parler.
J'arrive.
J'espère qu'il va se rendre.
ll faut aussi
que je l'empêche de sauter ?
Pardon, j'oubliais
votre blessure de guerre.
Capitaine Jarod Cody.
Cody ? Et moi,
je suis la reine du rodéo.
C'est parti.
Comment va Helen ?
Vous avez vu ma femme ?
Elle irait bien mieux
si vous vous rendiez.
lmpossible.
Les Colombiens nous trouveront.
C'est ce que disait Jimmy.
Pas question de me mouiller.
Vous oubliez Jimmy.
Le cartel ne l'a pas tué.
Jimmy vous a abandonné.
Non, il a eu peur.
Jimmy était mon meilleur ami.
ll vous a trahi, Eugene.
ll ne vous a pas parlé
de la drogue
et a voulu
vous faire porter le chapeau.
C'était une erreur.
ll voulait sauver notre affaire.
Je refuse d'en entendre plus.
Vous aimiez Jimmy, n'est-ce pas ?
C'était comme un frère.
Qui est-ce ?
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Vous êtes seul...
Vous en savez quoi ?
Vous êtes en cavale
et vous avez peur.
Vous pensez
ne pouvoir croire personne,
que tout le monde vous ment.
Ce n'est pas ce que je voulais.
Je sais.
Mais vous ne pourrez pas
toujours fuir.
C'est plus sûr pour moi...
et pour Helen.
Dites-lui que je l'aime, Jarod.
Cabine téléphonique,
Collinsville, Texas.
Ne fuyez plus.
Tout va s'arranger.
ll a une arme !
Promis.
ll n'est pas armé !
On arrive.
ll n'est pas armé !
Ne tirez pas,
il n'est pas armé !
Ne tirez pas !
Attrape-le !
J'ai un trafiquant mort,
un procès dans 3 jours
et maintenant, ça !
Adieu, votre beau record !
J'ai étudié toutes les données.
Dès que j'approche de quelqu'un
qui a des paramètres comparables,
je me heurte à un mur.
Vous pouvez draguer,
mais pas faire ça ?
Pas sans envoyer les photos
sur lnternet.
Désolé.
Vieillissez une des photos
et envoyez-la.
Dites-moi de quoi il s'agit.
Pardon ?
Je risque ma peau,
j'ai le droit
de savoir pourquoi.
ll s'agit de ma mère.
Ces enfants sont peut-être liés
à sa mort.
ll était comment ?
Comme un homme
à qui sa femme manque.
ll ne pense qu'à une chose...
vous.
Vous semblez très heureux.
Notre lune de miel.
Ca va faire un an.
On entend souvent parler de gens
qui épousent leur premier amour.
C'est mon cas.
Je n'ai jamais embrassé
d'autre garçon.
Après la cérémonie,
on est allés dans un motel
de Corpus Christi.
Ca a l'air sympa.
C'était un trou,
mais on n'avait pas les moyens.
Alors, c'est un bon souvenir.
Eugene se méfie de la police.
A cause de Jimmy Rayford.
lls étaient ensemble
à l'école primaire.
Des enfants embêtaient Eugene
et Jimmy l'a défendu.
ll a pris une raclée,
mais a évité bien pire à Eugene.
J'ai souvent entendu
cette histoire.
lls étaient amis.
Peu de choses sont aussi fortes.
La seule personne en qui Eugene
pensait toujours pouvoir croire
a fait de lui un trafiquant.
Pour Eugene, Jimmy était tout.
Et si Eugene avait raison
pour Jimmy ?
Jimmy Rayford a sauté de l'avion
par lâcheté.
ll voulait faire accuser Eugene.
Vous parlez d'un ami !
La police
a tiré sur votre mari
aujourd'hui.
lls l'ont raté.
La prochaine fois,
il peut avoir moins de chance.
Aidez-moi
et je pourrai aider Eugene.
ll y a une cabine téléphonique.
ll m'appelle.
Je n'ai jamais eu aussi peur,
Dr Shafton.
ll s'agit de M. Raines ?
Partout où il va,
tout ce qu'il touche...
malhonnêteté,
méchanceté...
Pourquoi ne pas lui en parler ?
Raines est dangereux.
ll est peut-être lié
au meurtre de Mme Parker.
Et l'accident qui a plongé
mon frère dans le coma
n'est peut-être pas un accident.
Vous cherchez des prétextes.
J'ai des fantasmes de meurtre...
celui de Raines.
On a moins de 48 h
avant que le jury
ne se réunisse.
Je veux que Diggs revienne,
prêt à témoigner.
ll faut que je le trouve.
Pour lui mettre
une balle dans la tête ?
- C'est un fugitif !
- C'est un gamin !
- ll était armé.
- C'est faux, vous le savez.
Pourquoi ça vous tient
tant à coeur ?
J'ai étudié le dossier.
ll n'y a aucun lien
entre Diggs et vous.
Qu'est-il arrivé
lors de la mort de Rayford ?
C'était ma faute, voilà tout.
Je suis allé dans le cockpit.
Soudain,
il y a eu une dépressurisation
et Garrison était lacéré.
Au secours !
Garrison m'a fait entrer
dans la police et je l'ai déçu.
Ce n'est pas que mon patron.
C'est mon ami.
On l'a trouvé dans l'ascenseur,
il descendait.
Tu ne peux pas t'échapper.
Je voulais seulement
retrouver mon ami.
Je sais qu'on serait amis.
Je n'ai pas ce pouvoir...
J'en ai marre d'être seul.
Marre de n'avoir personne
à qui parler.
Si j'avais un ami,
je ferais tout pour lui.
Aveux de Rayford
Ca fait 15 h qu'on parle, Jimmy.
Si on passe un accord,
promettez-moi
d'épargner Eugene.
ll ne savait rien.
C'est moi qui l'ai mêlé à ça.
Je ferai de la prison.
Vous devez
protéger Eugene des Colombiens.
C'est mon ami.
Si j'avais un ami,
je ferais tout pour lui.
C'est comme ça que vous comptez
m'acheter ?
Pourquoi je vous achèterais ?
Vous pensez
que j'ai parlé à Eugene.
Je veux vous parler.
Allez-y.
J'ai une copie
des aveux de Rayford.
Comment l'avez-vous eue ?
J'ai prétendu être procureur.
Je plaisante. Garrison l'avait.
Alors ?
Jimmy Rayford a demandé
une peine plus sévère
à condition qu'Eugene
ait un programme de protection.
ll l'a eu, non ?
Pourquoi Jimmy aurait sauté
s'il avait obtenu gain de cause ?
Vous êtes déjà allé en prison ?
Ca m'est arrivé.
Ce n'est pas le Club Med.
Selon vous, Jimmy Rayford
a fui pour éviter la prison.
Ca n'a pas de sens.
Dites-le à Garrison.
C'est lui qui a 75 points
dans le dos.
Pièce à conviction
Lane était allé
à l'avant de la cabine
pour utiliser la radio.
Le prisonnier
voulait aller aux W-C.
ll s'est baissé
pour refaire son lacet,
a pris un couteau
dans sa chaussette.
ll s'est redressé
et s'est jeté sur moi.
ll m'a frappé par derrière,
vers le bas...
On voit la marque sur ma chemise.
Je suis tombé et il s'est enfui.
ll s'est redressé
et s'est jeté sur moi.
ll m'a frappé
par derrière, vers le bas.
On voit la marque sur ma chemise.
Je suis tombé
et il s'est enfui.
C'est une affreuse tragédie
pour tout le service.
Bravo, Garrison.
Vous vous êtes poignardé
dans le dos.
Personne ne contrôle ce terminal ?
lci, on ne sait jamais.
Je me suis déconnecté
de l'unité centrale.
Ce bijou devrait voler
de ses propres ailes.
Vous portiez ces vêtements hier ?
Oui. Je traque ces visages
dans tout le pays
depuis... 16 heures
et j'ai retrouvé...
Darra Landers, 32 ans,
banlieue de Milwaukee.
Adresse ?
J'espère que ça vous aidera
à trouver la vérité.
Merci.
Et prenez un bain.
Calmez-le.
Reviens à la maison, chéri.
Tu me manques trop.
Ca ne sert plus à rien.
Je sais.
Mais je n'ai plus confiance
en eux.
lls ont voulu me tuer.
lls savaient où j'étais.
On ne se reverra jamais.
lls sont peut-être déjà
au courant.
Qu'est-ce que tu dis ?
Tu as dit que je t'appelais ?
Pardon.
Tu leur as dit ? Pourquoi ?
Parce que j'ai peur.
Tu m'as trahi.
J'arrive pas à croire
que tu m'aies fait ça.
Tu m'as trahi.
On peut faire confiance à Jarod.
Je n'aurais pas dû.
Je ne sais pas où il ira.
Là où il se sent en sécurité.
Un motel de lune de miel,
par exemple.
Parlez-moi encore...
de vos fantasmes violents.
Je pense à ce qu'a fait Raines.
Angelo, par exemple.
Angelo était mon projet.
Un jeune homme à part,
jusqu'à ce que Raines
le transforme en autre chose.
Quand je pense
aux esprits innocents
qu'il a détruits...
La directrice du Centre
ne peut pas vous aider ?
Je ne peux pas
lui faire confiance.
Je ne peux faire confiance
à aucun dirigeant du Centre.
Et Mlle Parker ?
Elle fouille
là où elle ne devrait pas.
Je l'ai déjà avertie,
mais elle refuse de m'écouter.
Qu'éprouvez-vous ?
De la colère, de l'impuissance.
Autre chose ?
Je n'en peux plus.
C'est moi, c'est Jarod.
Vous avez failli me faire tuer.
Je n'y suis pour rien. Promis.
Votre dernière promesse
a failli me coûter cher.
Je vous comprends,
mais faites-moi confiance.
Vous ne pouvez pas me protéger.
Je n'ai plus besoin de vous.
Je n'ai plus besoin de personne.
Quelqu'un a besoin de vous.
Tu n'aurais pas dû leur dire.
Tu aurais dû me faire confiance.
Comme j'avais confiance en toi
et en Jimmy.
Pardon, j'avais peur.
Et tu l'amènes ici...
ll n'est pas comme les autres.
ll est fiable.
Je te le jure.
Bienvenue chez vous.
Vous faites quoi, Jarod ?
Vous agissez sans mon accord,
vous mettez un civil en danger.
Vous avez lancé un défi,
je l'ai relevé.
L'important,
c'est qu'Eugene soit là.
Demain, on prend l'avion
et on démantèle le cartel.
Qu'il parte demain
à la première heure. Compris ?
Faire intervenir sa femme,
c'est bien joué.
Quand on fuit,
ceux qu'on aime,
ceux qui nous manquent
sont ce qui compte le plus.
A quoi vous jouez ?
Vous nous coûtez cher.
Le sort des deux témoins
devrait être réglé.
Mon client est satisfait
pour Rayford,
mais Diggs est encore vivant !
ll y a eu
des complications imprévues...
Peu importe. L'avion atterrira,
mais en mille morceaux.
La télécommande sert à ça ?
Elle désactivera
le système électrique.
Comme vous voudrez.
Je cherche Darra Landers.
Je pensais
que vous viendriez un jour.
Pardon ?
Vous êtes la soeur de Darra,
non ?
Sa soeur ?
Vous ressemblez
à celle qui a amené Darra.
Elle s'appelait Catherine...
Parker.
Je ne sais pas.
Seul l'avocat
connaissait son nom de famille.
Je peux parler à Darra ?
Je croyais que vous saviez.
Darra est morte il y a deux mois.
Darra était une enfant douée.
Elle a eu sa licence à 17 ans.
Elle adorait le théâtre,
jouait différents rôles.
Même quand elle était petite,
elle inventait tout un univers
dans lequel elle se perdait.
Elle semble avoir été
très heureuse.
On voulait ce qu'il y avait
de mieux pour elle.
Vous savez le nom de l'avocat
qui a organisé l'adoption ?
Steinman.
Non... Steinberg.
Michael Steinberg.
Savez-vous où je peux le trouver ?
Je regrette.
ll a déménagé sans un mot.
Je crois que c'était en 1982.
Vous n'avez eu aucun contact
avec ma mère ?
Mais je me rappelle
que M. Steinberg
a dit qu'elle rêvait
de s'installer en Europe,
d'offrir une vie meilleure
à sa petite fille.
Ce devait être vous.
Si je peux me permettre...
Comment est-elle...
Une opération.
De l'appendicite.
Elle allait bien
et l'instant d'après...
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Darra le portait
quand votre mère l'a amenée.
Vous pouvez le prendre.
On voulait que tous les amis
de Darra aient un souvenir.

- Jarod à l'appareil.
- C'est Helen.
Je m'inquiète pour Eugene.
Eugene ne prendra pas cet avion.
Garrison et Lane l'ont emmené.
lls partent ce soir.
Quelqu'un est monté à bord.
Le pilote vient de m'appeler.
Quelqu'un est monté dans l'avion.
Où ça ?
Regarde !
Alors ?
ll n'y a personne.
- Où est l'ouverture ?
- Au fond.
Reste là.
Je viens.
Rappelez-vous la dernière fois.
Tu ne sais pas t'arrêter.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Tout va bien. Restez assis.
Ton flingue !
C'est ce qui est arrivé
à Rayford ?
Vous l'avez largué
pour qu'il se taise ?
La vérité ne paie plus.
J'appuie sur ce bouton
et deux minutes après,
l'avion
explose à travers l'Oklahoma.
Ne bougez pas.
Bien joué.
Pourquoi ?
Les finances.
Défendre Rayford
ne rapporte rien.
Prenez un parachute.
Prenez la télécommande.
Salope !
Les amis vous grillent toujours.
Le système électrique
est coupé !
S.O.S. ! lci le vol 1 701 .
On a perdu le contrôle !
Je répète,
on a perdu le contrôle !
Garrison et Michaels
sont de mèche.
Dites au pilote de freiner !
On a une minute !
Vous avez 30 secondes !
30 secondes, Jarod !
15 secondes !
On a 15 secondes !
Je savais que ça servirait.
On a enfin mis les fers
à la bonne personne !
J'arrête les recherches.
Pourquoi ?
J'ai des résultats
sur les autres noms de la liste.
La plupart sont morts.
Ne me lâchez pas maintenant.
Vous ne comprenez pas.
lls sont morts de façon soudaine
ces six derniers mois.
Mon Dieu !
C'est mauvais signe.
Je dois y aller.
Vous semblez contrarié,
M. Broots.
Tout va bien ?
Traquer Jarod
est un travail très prenant.
Et vous avez fait
des heures supplémentaires.
Je suis navré de voir
que vous avez déconnecté
votre ordinateur.
Je me demande si vous êtes
loyal envers cette mission
ou envers un intérêt personnel.
Je n'ai pas d'intérêt personnel.
Dois-je vous rappeler
les conséquences
pour qui ment au Centre ?
Les actes de Broots
sont sous mon autorité.
Alors, je vous tiens
pour responsable
du manque de résultats.
Faites ce que vous voulez,
mais vous n'obtiendrez rien
si vous ne vous écartez pas.
J'ai des affaires à régler.
Nous en reparlerons une autre fois.
Vous savez où me trouver.
Jarod se dit incapable
de finir la simulation
sans un autre Caméléon.
J'ai convaincu un collègue
d'établir de nouveaux paramètres
pour ce programme.
J'ai quelqu'un à te présenter.
Jarod, voici Kyle.
Où t'ont-ils emmené, Kyle ?
ll les a enterrés.
Vous auriez vu ça.
Bonne chance.
Vous allez repartir à zéro.
Merci, Jarod.
On va être qui ?
Rassurez-vous,
personne ne vous trouvera.
Je le sais par expérience.
Celle d'un policier.
Pas vraiment.
Je crois qu'aujourd'hui
je serai cuisinier !
Quel est votre ingrédient secret ?
Si je vous le disais,
il ne serait plus secret.
Tenez, chère madame.
Régalez-vous !

Vu dans Le Caméléon :
Qui suis-je ?
J'ai été acheté ou volé ?
Où sont mes parents ?
C'était ma faute.
Je devrais être dans ce lit.
Jarod est dur à attraper.
Ramenez-le,
ou quelqu'un d'autre le fera.
C'est clair ?
Un cimetière d'animaux fermé
Jarod, va à La Nouvelle-Orléans,
pour voir l'homme de la photo.
ll détient peut-être
la clé du passé.
Voici vos clés.
Vous avez la chambre 323.
Au secours.
ll y a quelqu'un ?
Aidez-moi.
Ne me claquez pas
dans les doigts.
Ne mourez pas.
Réveillez-vous.
La réception, vous désirez ?
Non, rien.
Je suis en bas.
On le fait, ce contrat ?
- Le contrat ?
- Fais pas le mariole.
On a un mec à buter.
Tu marches ?
Je marche.
Comment je te reconnais ?
Je boite.
Mlle Parker arrête de fumer ?
Comment ?
Le patch à la nicotine.
Je salue sa résolution.
La résolution est une chose,
mais le meurtre...
Jarod a pris contact ?
Comment allez-vous ?
Devinez.
On a reçu un e-mail de Jarod,
adressé à Sydney.
Affichez-le.
C'est personnel.
A l'écran.
Ca va, Broots.
Je n'ai pas de secret
pour Mlle Parker.
Jamais vu personne mâcher
du chewing-gum ?
''Sydney, vous êtes attendu
au Twin City Hotel
''à Minneapolis le 22
pour un congrès très spécial,
''pouvant détenir
la clé du passé. Jarod.''
Le 22, c'est aujourd'hui.
- Qui d'autre est au courant ?
- Personne.
Préparez le jet du Centre
pour un décollage.
Minneapolis.
Un passager.
Un ?
Le message était pour moi.
En ce qui concerne Jarod,
pas de ''moi''.
Seulement ''nous''.
Pour deux passagers.
Prenez ça.
Vous en aurez besoin.
T'as pas l'air d'un tueur.
Faut pas se fier aux apparences.
Je voudrais une cartouche
de cigarettes mentholées
sur son oreiller
à son arrivée.
Au nom de Parker.
Mlle Parker.
Parfait, fantastique.
Merci.
Magnifique.
Broots à l'appareil.
Un problème de sécurité ?
Non, je ne suis pas au courant
de transmissions concernant Jarod.
Entrez.
Enchanté.
Venez vous asseoir.
Je reste debout.
M. Beaulieu
t'offre une chaise.
Tais-toi, Donny.
Pardonnez mon neveu.
ll est jeune
et plein de fougue.
Déjà sucé des écrevisses,
monsieur... ?
Doe.
Jarod Doe.
Pas que je me souvienne.
C'est tout simple.
On arrache la tête
et on suce.
J'aimerais en finir rapidement.
J'admire votre franchise.
Ca manque,
par les temps qui courent.
On vous a engagé
car vous n'êtes lié
à personne ici.
Votre tête n'est pas connue.
On ne vous liera donc pas
à moi.
A ce qu'il paraît,
vous êtes propre et discret,
à part cette histoire
de prendre des photos.
Buter un type
et le prendre en photo...
Vous avez vos affaires.
Moi, les miennes.
Sachez que votre infirmité
n'entame en rien
ma confiance en vous.
C'est très généreux.
T'auras une place
sur le parking du club.
Le gars s'appelle
Benjamin worth.
L'adresse est au dos.
Pourquoi le tuer ?
Vous avez vos affaires.
Moi, les miennes.
$25 000 maintenant.
$25 000 quand ce sera fait.
Une fois sa mort confirmée,
vous aurez l'identité
de la 2e cible.
La 2e cible ?
C'est le même marché.
J'envoie Donny
comme témoin.
Ca vous pose problème ?
Si oui,
je trouverai quelqu'un d'autre.
Pas de problème.
Je suis votre homme.
Je sais ça.
- C'est quoi ?
- J'ai besoin de pellicule.
Va en acheter.
Haute sensibilité,
SGR 3200, noir et blanc.
Pour mes photos.
Où je trouve ça ?
C'est pas mon problème.
Rendez-vous à l'hôtel dans 3 h.
Mon instinct me dit
que Jarod avait une raison.
Je me fiche de votre instinct.
C'est encore
un de ses jeux de piste.
Où êtes-vous ?
Broots, du calme.
Raines est au courant.
- De quoi ?
- Du message de Jarod.
ll sait où on est ?
Non, mais ça viendra.
ll fouine partout.
ll a mis des micros.
D'où appelez-vous ?
Mutant...
- Un problème ?
- ll y en a toujours.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Je crois savoir
ce qu'on fait ici.
Elle est à vendre
depuis 3 semaines.
La plomberie est foutue
et la peinture aussi,
mais c'est le coin
le plus calme
de La Nouvelle-Orléans.
Ca a l'air bien.
Vous êtes
de l'agence immobilière ?
Non, madame.
Je vends
des voitures de collection
à Baton Rouge.
Vous connaissez cet homme ?
Sonny Herbert.
Je ne l'ai pas vu
depuis 25 ans.
Je m'intéresse à sa voiture.
C'était sa fierté.
ll habitait ici.
ll travaillait à Fat City.
Je ne sais plus
exactement où.
Je vois encore toutes les photos
qu'il avait dans sa chambre.
- Les photos ?
- Des enfants.
M. Herbert était détective privé.
Sa spécialité :
retrouver des enfants perdus.
Comment ce voyage
pourrait être plus déprimant ?
J'ai soif.
Va te chercher un autre verre.
Et reviens vite.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
Je viens pour vous tuer.
Ca devrait marcher.
Mais il faut m'aider.
J'arrive.
Faut que j'y aille.
Garde ton sang-froid.
Je sais pas où elle est.
Ecoutez-moi !
Pas d'excuse. Pour 300$ la nuit,
je veux de la glace !
Très drôle, Sydney.
Excusez-moi ?
Les cigarettes sur mon oreiller.
Je n'y suis pour rien.
Vous lui avez parlé
du patch ?
Moi ?
Docteur ?
- On ne pensait pas...
- Vous voir...
A la conférence.
J'ai besoin d'un grand verre.
- Vous nous...
- Reconnaissez ?
- Millie...
- Et Tillie Pilcher.
Nous faisions partie...
Du programme d'études.
Vous me prenez pour un autre.
- Comment...
- Vous oublier ?
Docteur Jacob.
On va vraiment le faire.
On va le buter.
Toi, tu restes ici
à faire le guet.
Je suis pas venu
faire le chien de garde.
Ecoute-moi.
C'est pas un jeu
ni un cours par correspondance
sponsorisé par les allumettes.
Des gens vont mourir
et ce sera fait
par moi, à ma façon
et seul.
C'est clair ?
C'est clair ?
Pas besoin
de me faire un dessin.
ll est mort ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fous là ?
Réponds-moi.
ll est mort.
Tout s'est bien passé ?
Je l'ai pas entendu se plaindre.
Aide-moi à le descendre.
Je veux voir le corps.
- Tu plaisantes ?
- A ton avis ?
La prochaine fois
que l'envie te prend
de pointer un flingue sur moi,
appuie sur la détente.
Aide-moi à le descendre.
- Pourquoi on s'arrête ?
- Pour larguer le colis.
lci ?
Oncle Tug aime bien
fertiliser ce champ.
Y a une pelle à l'arrière.
Jacob a passé des mois
à l'hôpital
avant d'être transféré
dans une clinique.
- Quand...
- A eu lieu l'accident ?
Le 2 août 1967.
Excusez-nous.
C'était un plaisir.
Merci de ton aide.
Tu les butes,
tu les enterres.
On y va.
Souvenir d'un mort.
Tu l'as vu faire ?
Pas exactement.
Pas exactement ?
Je l'ai vu l'enterrer,
pas le buter.
Je travaille seul.
Les photos vous donneront
un gros plan.
Je prends les doubles.
La prochaine cible.
Cette fois,
je veux qu'il voie ça.
Compris ?
C'est vous le chef.
On y va quand ?
Je t'appellerai.
- Pourquoi Tug veut vous tuer ?
- Question à 64 000$.
ll ne me paie que 50 000$.
Mettez-vous à ma place.
Vous entrez chez moi, armé.
Vous me dites
qu'on veut me tuer.
Vous simulez mon meurtre
et m'enterrez avec une paille
pour respirer.
- Et alors ?
- Je ne sais pas qui vous êtes.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Pourquoi Beaulieu veut vous tuer ?
Des conflits professionnels.
Des conflits ?
J'ai deux clubs de jazz.
Beaulieu voulait m'acheter.
J'ai refusé.
ll tuerait pour ça ?
C'est un petit club,
mais la terre vaut cher.
Une seconde.
Où allez-vous ?
Vous n'êtes pas le seul
qu'il veut faire tuer.
C'est ma femme.
Votre femme ?
- Mais dans la piscine...
- Séparés.
On est en phase
de réconciliation.
Elle tient un club
et moi, l'autre.
Ne répondez pas au téléphone
et n'allez pas aux w.-c.
Si je dois... ?
Pas question.
Venez.
Qui c'est ?
Celui qui devait
vraiment vous tuer.
Le seau à glace sera parfait.
L'immeuble est à vendre
depuis 2 ans.
Ca n'a plus d'intérêt,
sans M. Herbert.
Je vais le faire sauter
et vendre le terrain.
J'arrive à temps.
Je peux regarder ?
Vous étiez un des enfants
qu'il cherchait ?
J'en sais rien.
J'espère trouver une trace
de mes parents.
D'autres hommes
sont venus le voir ?
Juste avant qu'il disparaisse.
D'après eux,
il leur devait du fric.
De vraies armoires à glace.
J'ai pas posé trop de questions.
L'un d'eux avait
une bouteille d'oxygène.
Un type bizarre, les yeux
enfoncés. Vous le connaissez ?
On s'est croisés.
lls n'ont rien pris ?
Non. J'ai pas eu le temps
de leur parler du sous-sol.
Des cartons pleins de dossiers
et de photos.
Surtout d'enfants disparus.
- C'est tout ?
- Oui.
C'est pas là.
Rien sur vos parents ?
Ca ne remonte
que sur 20 ans.
Je regrette.
Je ne suis pas là.
Je ne suis pas là.
Oublie ta carrière une seconde.
Je parle des enfants.
Qu'est-ce qui te tracasse ?
Comment on les a eus.
J'en sais assez.
Ce que le Centre
veut bien te dire.
Tu fais toujours ça,
tu évacues ce qui ne colle pas
à ton idéal.
Et toi, tu t'empoisonnes la vie.
Jacob !
ll faut qu'on parle.
Vous comptez
le garder longtemps ?
Je sais pas.
Je m'y suis attaché.
Cet homme est malade.
J'aime cet endroit.
C'est si calme.
Vous avez travaillé
pour Sonny 10 ans ?
Onze.
ll avait mis une annonce,
pleine de fautes.
J'ai eu pitié de lui.
Qu'est-ce que vous lui voulez ?
Quand j'étais petit,
j'ai été séparé de mes parents.
lls ont pu s'adresser
à M. Herbert.
- Et les dossiers ?
- Trop récents.
Je dois parler à Sonny.
C'est impossible.
- Pourquoi ?
- ll est à l'hôpital.
Des brûlures
sur 80% du corps.
D'après la police,
il s'est endormi en fumant.
Vous n'y croyez pas ?
Sonny était insomniaque.
ll aurait été réveillé
par les flammes.
Je l'ai dit à la police,
mais on n'avait pas de preuve
et c'en est resté là.
Autre chose ?
Sonny pensait
qu'il était suivi.
Après l'incident,
j'ai eu peur.
Où est-il ?
Aux Anciens Combattants,
à Slidel.
- Après notre entrevue...
- On s'est dit...
- La même chose...
- Sur l'accident.
Vous dites que c'est arrivé...
- Le 2 août...
- 1967.
Nous avions vu...
- Le Dr Jacob...
- Le lundi d'avant.
Vous vous rappelez
que c'était lundi,
il y a 30 ans de ça ?
- C'était la veille de notre 10e...
- Anniversaire.
- Nous n'avions jamais vu...
- De revolver.
- Le Dr Jacob criait.
- Après vous ?
- Mais il criait...
- Très fort.
- L'autre homme disait...
- ''Sans participer à la solution...
''Vous participez au problème.''
- Le Dr Jacob...
- S'est fâché.
Et alors...
ll a mis le revolver...
Dans le cou du Dr Jacob.
Le Dr Billy.
Le Dr william Raines.
Le Dr Billy nous faisait
très peur.
L'enfoiré !
Je vais oublier
ce que tu as fait.
Et ce serait malpoli
de te tuer en famille.
Où est le corps de worth ?
C'est pour ça ?
Je l'ai déplacé.
Au cas où Gros Dur
ouvrirait sa grande gueule,
vous seriez couvert.
Mais tu ferais pas ça.
Et la femme ?
Je t'ai vu entrer chez elle.
T'as pas chômé.
Chacun ses lubies.
Moi, c'est la photo.
Mais je commence à me lasser,
alors, je l'ai prise vivante.
Pointe pas ton flingue.
Range-le.
- Elle est en vie ?
- Pour l'heure.
Je la tuerai devant vous.
Je connais un bois
près d'ici.
Parfait pour
qu'une femme délaissée
vienne en voiture,
remonte sa vitre
et s'asphyxie.
Je savais que
vous feriez l'affaire.
Attendez.
On dit que vous boitez
car vous avez pris une balle,
qu'on a dû vous enlever
de l'os. C'est vrai ?
Oui, c'est vrai.
Montrez-moi.
Votre genou.
Autre chose ?
Allons-y.
Je dois pisser.
On a assez dérangé M. Doe.
Ne salis pas
sa chambre d'hôtel.
Tout est en place ?
On croira qu'elle s'est tuée
suite à la disparition
de son mari
et à sa faillite.
Parfait.
Parlons d'argent.
Y a un souci.
Quel genre ?
Ce genre-là.
Comme ça, j'ai la paix.
- Descends-le.
- Avec joie.
Grosse erreur.
Tu n'apprendras jamais ?
Montez.
- Combien vous voulez ?
- Combien ?
Tu crois pouvoir te racheter ?
Assez, Ben.
Je crois qu'il a pigé.
Montez, ou je vous tue.
Toi aussi, la fouine.
C'est l'heure
de ma dernière séance photo.
Je vais vous poser
quelques questions.
Si vous répondez bien,
ce sera vite terminé.
Avez-vous engagé un tueur
pour tuer Ben et Doris worth ?
J'ai vu votre cicatrice !
Pas mal, non ?
Un peu de cire
et voilà !
Vouliez-vous faire tuer
Ben et Doris worth ?
Ca n'arrangera rien.
N'essayez pas
de casser une vitre.
Elles sont blindées.
Vous m'avez pas l'air
d'humeur très causante.
Les gaz d'échappement.
Bonne chance à vous deux.
ll t'a engagé
pour les tuer !
Pour les tuer tous !
Je sais où sont les corps.
J'entends rien.
Je l'ai fait.
100 000 dollars
si vous m'ouvrez.
C'est un paquet de fric.
Ce serait fou
de ne pas y réfléchir.
J'ai réfléchi.
C'est non.
Vous les laissez mourir ?
ll n'y a pas beaucoup d'essence.
Le moteur va caler
dans 30 secondes.
J'aimerais les voir
s'expliquer à la police.
Elle ne va pas tarder.
Que dire ?
Merci, mon vieux.
Vous deux...
Vous faites la paire.
Envisagez une fusion.
- Tu vois ?
- Ne commence pas.
Tu me manques, Jacob.
Tu m'as manqué aussi.
Tu aurais dû me parler avant.
J'avais peur.
Je pensais que...
si j'essayais et que j'échouais,
tu partirais à jamais.
Jacob, ce soir-là
dans la voiture...
Je te l'ai déjà dit, Sydney,
ce n'était pas ta faute.
Je n'écoutais pas
ce que tu essayais
de me dire.
Tu avais des ennuis.
J'aurais dû t'aider.
J'avais...
honte.
De te dire
ce que j'avais fait.
Les choses...
Raines est pour quelque chose
dans ce qui t'est arrivé ?
Tu connais la réponse
à cette question.
Vous êtes prêt ?
Pas un mot !
Vous pouvez parler
à M. Herbert,
mais depuis l'accident,
il est souvent inconscient.
M. Herbert ?
Sonny ?
Je m'appelle Jarod.
M. Herbert, il y a trente ans,
mes parents ont pu
vous demander de me trouver.
Vous étiez détective privé
et cherchiez des enfants perdus.
Les enfants.
La reconnaissez-vous ?
C'est ma mère.
Vous rappelez-vous son nom ?
Cette femme...
voulait retrouver
son petit garçon.
C'est exact.
Vous rappelez-vous son nom ?
M. Herbert,
vous rappelez-vous son nom ?
Son nom...
Merci pour la photo.
Quelle photo ?
Sonny Herbert.
Je ne t'ai envoyé aucune photo.
J'allais te remercier
du message
m'informant du congrès
sur les jumeaux.
Je ne vous ai rien envoyé.
Alors, qui ?
Adaptation

Sous-titrage
NlCE FELLOw
Vu dans Le Caméléon :
Oui, M. Parker.
Angelo cherche sur lnternet
des signes de Jarod.
SL-27...
Ca veut dire quoi, Jacob ?
SL-27.
Ca veut dire quoi ?
ll a un nom ?
On l'appelle Jarod.
Ses parents lui manquent.
ll les oubliera vite.
J'ai trouvé ce plan.
ll est pas loin.
Trouvez-le !
- Une berline bleue.
- Montez !
Christine !
Navré.
Je sais qu'il est tard.
ll est 3 h.
Même Dieu dort.
Je dois revenir habiter ici
quelque temps.
Pas empestant comme ça.
Je vous dois un fier service,
mais mon mari rentre demain.
S'il trouve un homme
là-haut, il va criser.
D'où il vient ?
Un homme l'a jeté
dans une poubelle.
Comment peut-on faire ça ?
Comment peut-on
jeter un bébé ?
Le monde est fou.
Des gosses font des gosses.
Les gens savent pas
ce qu'ils veulent...
On gèle, ici.
ll faut appeler la police.
Je suis sa seule famille,
maintenant.
ll a froid, il a peur
et il est seul.
Vous aimez les bébés ?
Bien sûr.
Mais Ax n'a pas eu
le boulot
à Houston.
ll va criser, s'il voit un bébé.
ll aime pas les bébés ?
Non. Si...
C'est pas la question.
ll a faim.
Comment vous le savez ?
Parce que j'ai faim.
Tu veux t'allonger ?
Pourquoi Jarod risquerait
d'être pris pour deux plans ?
En ce qui concerne Jarod,
rien n'est laissé au hasard.
Le petit génie
est un vrai l.M. Pei.
C'est quoi, SL-27 ?
Je reviens.
Qui vous a appris ça ?
J'en sais rien.
Ma mère, je crois.
Vous croyez ?
Enfant,
j'ai été enlevé à ma famille.
J'ai été élevé par des gens...
qui n'ont rien à faire
avec des enfants.
Désolée.
J'apprécie ce que
vous avez fait pour moi.
Ce procès m'aurait ruinée
sans votre intervention.
Mais je ne peux pas
vous laisser...
Appelez-moi
si vous voulez quelque chose.
ll a un nom ?
On l'appelle Jarod.
Ses parents lui manquent.
ll les oubliera vite.
Comment peut-on
abandonner un enfant ?
lls sont si vulnérables,
sans défense...
Comment peut-on ?
Tu parles de tes parents ?
De tous les parents.
ll n'y a pas de réponse
toute faite.
Qui sait quelles pressions
subissent les gens ?
C'est ce que tu cherchais
dans ce cabinet d'architecte ?
Ces plans ?
C'est un indice sur tes parents ?
A vous de deviner.
C'est pour ma petite fille.
Elle a de la chance
d'avoir un père si attentionné.
J'ai fait votre recherche.
J'ai trouvé 2 plaques
immatriculées ''SL-27'',
mais les propriétaires
sont morts dans les années 70.
SL-27 est aussi le nom
d'un antibiotique
mis au point par un laboratoire
israélien en 1983.
C'est bien trop récent.
Si vous m'en disiez plus,
je pourrais vous aider.
Mieux vaut que personne
ne soit au courant.
Du nouveau
sur SL-27 ?
Vous devriez vous parler.
ll dort encore ?
Comme un bébé.
Vous faites quoi ?
Je pirate la fréquence
des personnes disparues.
Vous pouvez pas
garder ce bébé.
Hier soir, c'était une chose,
mais quelqu'un doit le chercher.
Je capte la radio de la police,
la télé, les journaux.
Personne ne le cherche.
Un homme l'a jeté à la poubelle.
Je devrais le lui rendre ?
Si sa mère le cherche,
je la trouverai.
Mais je le rends pas
avant d'être certain
qu'il sera en sûreté.
Je ne veux pas
qu'il grandisse seul.
Encore faim ?
ll pleure pas pour ça.
Qu'en savez-vous ?
Sept petits frères et soeurs.
ll faut le changer.
J'ai neutralisé les caméras
et les micros.
- Je crois qu'on est tranquilles.
- Vous croyez ?
On sait jamais, au Centre.
Allons-y.
C'était à un des enfants
sauvés du Centre par ma mère.
Regardez.
SL...
27.
Pourquoi n'avez-vous rien dit ?
Je pourrais
vous retourner la question.
Quand mon frère
a repris connaissance,
il m'a écrit ceci.
ll doit y avoir un indice
dans les calculs laissés par Jarod.
Broots, continuez
à chercher le lien.
Vous n'avez peut-être
pas remarqué,
mais les gens au courant de SL-27
sont soit morts, soit comateux.
Et ces gens nous sont très chers.
Comme votre fille pour vous.
Je vous demande de m'aider.
En ami.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fait ?
ll semble exprimer
son individualité.
C'est bon signe ?
C'est dangereux.
Angelo, je veux que tu vérifies
en détail le système
de sécurité du Centre.
Chaque dispositif,
chaque niveau,
chaque mode d'accès
et chaque sortie.
Optique, physique, électronique.
Tout.
Tu as compris ?
- Excusez-moi.
- Tout de suite.
Je consulte le dossier.
On a demandé
aux grands-parents biologiques,
mais la situation reste
à éclaircir.
Vous désirez ?
C'est à propos
d'un bébé disparu.
Dans un instant.
C'est illégal de placer
un enfant
sans la signature
d'un parent biologique.
Je sais que c'est dur, Jarod,
mais c'est la meilleure
solution.
Vous êtes malade ?
Vous pouvez pas emmener ce bébé.
- Ni le leur laisser.
- ll n'est pas à vous.
Je sais.
ll devrait être
avec ses parents,
ou avec quelqu'un qui l'aime.
24 heures,
et on amène le bébé à la police,
quoi qu'il arrive.
D'accord ?
D'accord.
Et puis, donnez-lui un nom.
ll a un nom.
Reste à savoir lequel.
- Quoi ?
- Tous ces autocollants rouges...
L'homme qui a jeté le bébé
avait le même sur sa plaque.
Ca veut dire ?
C'est un flic
qui a jeté le bébé.
- Dites-moi tout.
- Devinez.
Le cabinet d'architecte
où était Jarod...
Est celui qui a construit
le Centre.
Comment vous avez su ?
- lci Sydney.
- Ca avance ?
- Quoi donc ?
- Bonjour, Mlle Parker.
SL-27.
Ces calculs...
ça veut dire quoi ?
Je creuse sous les gravats
du Centre.
- Je ne te suis pas.
- Faites l'addition.
Ca ne colle pas.
Je m'étonne que Broots
n'ait pas trouvé.
Je dois vous laisser.
C'est la sieste du bébé.
ll a dit ''bébé'' ?
lncroyable.
2,2 millions de m3
de gravats
ont été extraits
pour la construction du Centre.
Or le Centre,
avec ses 26 niveaux souterrains,
n'occupe
que 2,1 millions de m3.
Ca fait assez de gravats manquants
pour un autre niveau souterrain.
SL-27.
Sub Level 27.
C'est ma mère.
On trouvera la tienne.
- Promis.
- Joli tableau !
Vous voulez des enfants,
avec Ax ?
Pas question.
Je dois m'occuper
de mon salon.
- Du nouveau sur la voiture ?
- Pas encore.
En infiltrant la police,
je saurai qui la conduisait.
J'aurai besoin de vous.
J'ai des clients,
je ne peux pas...
On m'a pris ma place.
Après 15 jours,
je n'ai droit qu'à ''Ax'' ?
Ca s'est bien passé ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Jarod.
Qui c'est ?
Je peux expliquer...
Regarde ses yeux.
- Ca vous ennuie ?
- Pas du tout.
ll est mignon tout plein.
C'est un garçon ?
Vous aimez les enfants ?
J'en aurais toute une tribu
si Christy coopérait.
Pour le garder,
je suis partant.
Je m'en souviendrai.
Je vais bouger le camion.
- Du nouveau sur le scanner ?
- Pas encore.
Vous avez menti sur Ax.
J'ai grandi
avec 7 frères et soeurs.
J'étais l'aînée et ma mère...
elle avait la bougeotte.
Et votre père ?
ll s'occupait
de son autre famille.
C'était à moi de nourrir
Ari et william,
d'habiller Matty,
de coucher Jeremy tôt
et de faire réciter Ella.
J'ai quitté Little Rock
pour vivre avec Ax.
Je veux penser un peu
à Christine.
C'est mal ?
C'est humain.
Vous pouvez jeter un oeil
dessus ?
Pas de problème.
J'ai cogné un junkie
pas coopérant.
La prochaine fois,
il coopérera.
Réparez-moi ça.
- Je suis pressé.
- Entendu,
inspecteur... ?
David w. Geary.
Elles sont pareilles ?
Je reviens.
Réélisez Mitch Meyers
Procureur
C'est par ici.
Quoi ?
La bouche d'égout.
Le conduit est de l'autre côté.
Alors, pourquoi y a-t-il
une plaque ici ?
Aidez-moi, Sydney.
Vous sentez l'odeur ?
L'odeur ?
Je sens le goût.
Après vous.
C'est peut-être surveillé.
J'ai dirigé la sécurité
pendant 3 ans.
Je m'y connais.
Pas sur SL-27.
Allez-y.
Je ne sais pas
si ma mutuelle couvre ça.
Sydney, éclairez-moi.
Y a un truc mort ?
Y a un truc pas mort ?
On y va.
T'as vu ? Parfois, la chance
vaut mieux que le talent.
Je regardais le basket
avec mon père.
Je rêve de le faire
avec mon fils.
Christine m'a tout raconté.
Vous pensez
que c'est ce flic ?
ll s'appelle David Geary.
ll travaille
pour Myers, le procureur.
Les bureaucrates...
Vous en êtes pas fan ?
J'ai conduit
un camion poubelle 20 ans.
Je me suis ruiné le dos
en portant une benne.
La municipalité me vire,
me sucre ma pension.
Je peux pas travailler.
Vous êtes éboueur ?
Technicien de surface.
J'en vois,
des trucs dégueulasses,
mais faire du mal
à une merveille pareille,
ça me dépasse.
Quoi ?
La police a reçu
un avis de disparition.
Ca semble correspondre.
Jeanette Connelly.
Portée disparue
par sa voisine
avec son fils de 5 mois,
Michael.
Bien sûr qu'on la recherche.
Elle a disparu.
N'en faites pas une pendule.
Tout va bien.
ll doit y avoir
une centaine de salles.
C'était quoi, ici ?
En tout cas,
il y a eu un sacré incendie.
ll y a eu des rumeurs
d'incendie l'été 1982.
J'étais en France
avec mon père.
- J'aimerais y être, là.
- La rumeur dit
que c'est l'incendie
qui a mis Raines sous oxygène.
Dommage qu'il l'ait pas achevé.
Regardez.
Des traces de pas.
Elles sont fraîches.
Qui jouait ici ?
Un diable dans la boîte.
Fascinant...
Allez voir la combinaison.
C'est toujours Broots.
ll a une balle dans l'oeil !
Quelque part,
je l'envie un peu.
Qu'y a-t-il, Angelo ?
Une alerte au niveau souterrain ?
Elle n'est pas là.
Police, madame.
C'est pas le genre
à disparaître avec un bébé.
Elle est gentille, pas bête.
J'ai tout dit
à l'autre policier.
Quand ?
10 mn avant votre arrivée.
- lci voiture 36.
- Allez-y.
On a trouvé une fille
sous le pont d'East River.
Blanche, dans les 20 ans,
sans papiers.
Ca date de plusieurs jours.
On l'emmène à St Mary.
Reçu. Qu'est-il arrivé ?
- Et Jeanette ?
- Je vais m'occuper d'elle.
Des seringues ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
ll y a tous les éléments
d'un labo de simulation.
Je ne savais pas
qu'il y en avait un autre.
Moi non plus.
C'est quoi, ce truc ?
Une table d'accouchement.
Avec des chaînes ?
C'est M. Raines.
Qu'attendez-vous ?
C'est quoi, cet endroit ?
En tout cas, ce n'était pas
une salle d'archives.
lls n'ont pas brûlé.
On les a apportés.
Tous ces dossiers
concernent le projet Caméléon.
Ce carton est sur Jarod.
C'est quoi ?
Une cagoule.
Sûrement celle de Jarod.
ll n'y a pas de date de décès
pour les parents de Jarod.
Apparemment, ils étaient en vie
quand on l'a amené ici.
Jarod a été volé.
Vous devriez
regarder cette fiche.
Aucun nom,
aucune piste.
C'est signé par l'expéditeur
qui l'a amené.
L'expéditeur ? Jacob...
C'est la signature de mon frère.
Quoi ?
Raines fait vérifier
la sécurité par Angelo.
- ll sait où on est ?
- Je crois pas.
Comment ça ?
Je ne sais pas !
C'était bizarre.
Raines était méfiant
et Angelo ricanait.
Si vous voyiez sa tête...
Gardez la vôtre froide.
- C'est Raines.
- ll sait.
On prend les dossiers.
Quelqu'un les a mis là.
- On éveillerait les soupçons.
- Si c'était notre seule chance ?
Je veux savoir la vérité
autant que vous,
mais à ce stade,
soyons prudents.
lnspecteur Dave Geary,
pour l'inconnue.
Je regarde.
Tentative de suicide.
Un instant.
Voilà... Chambre 708.
Jeanette, réveillez-vous.
Ne me donnez plus
de sédatifs,
je ne suis pas folle.
Je sais.
Je ne voulais pas me tuer.
On m'a poussée. Un policier.
Personne ne me croit.
Je vous crois.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Jarod.
Je viens vous aider.
ll a pris mon bébé.
J'ai votre bébé.
- ll est avec moi.
- Où est Michael ?
En sûreté. Mais filons. Celui
qui voulait vous tuer est là.
J'avais si peur
de ne plus le revoir.
Où l'avez-vous trouvé ?
Peu importe.
L'important,
c'est que vous soyez réunis.
Pourquoi un policier
voudrait vous tuer ?
A cause de Mitch Myers ?
C'est le fils de Mitch ?
J'étais stagiaire
dans son bureau.
Je le croyais bon,
sincère.
On a eu une liaison.
ll m'a dit qu'il voulait
quitter sa femme.
J'avais du mal à payer le loyer,
alors je lui ai demandé
d'agir en père.
Et ?
ll m'a dit qu'il ferait
le nécessaire et je l'ai cru...
L'inspecteur Geary
est venu,
disant que Mitch
voulait me voir
pour nous aider.
Je ne pensais pas...
On est montés en voiture.
ll m'a jetée du pont.
J'entendais Michael qui pleurait.
Je vais lui casser la gueule.
On peut aller à la police,
maintenant ?
On a un peu de politique
à faire avant.
Je veux vous aider.
Pour Michael.
Les poubelles passent demain ?
Mitch Myers.
C'est urgent.
Jeanette, écoute.
Quand il est né...
ll s'appelle Michael.
Quand Michael est né,
j'ai réfléchi à mon image.
Ma femme, mes enfants,
toi si jeune...
Tout ce pour quoi
je m'étais battu s'envolait.
Et tu as voulu nous tuer ?
Je ne suis pas comme ça.
Je t'aime.
Si tu veux éviter
que ça passe au JT,
demande à Geary d'apporter
50 000$ là où il a laissé Michael.
Police.
Vous passerez une autre fois.
Pas question.
Vous savez pas
ce que vous faites.
On se sent nu ?
Un peu vulnérable ?
C'est terrifiant, non ?
D'être à la merci
de quelqu'un,
sans défense...
Comme un petit bébé...
jeté dans une poubelle
en pleine nuit.
Vous avez jeté
un bébé innocent.
J'attends ce moment
depuis que je vous ai vu
dans cette ruelle.
En tant que procureur,
j'ai oeuvré pour cette ville,
lui rendant confiance
dans les élus.
Excusez-moi, Mme Myers.
Jeanette Connelly.
J'ai eu une liaison
avec votre mari.
Je crois dans l'engagement.
Jan, mon épouse
depuis 15 ans,
mes deux filles,
Jessica et Lindsay.
Je sais que,
pour fonder une famille,
il faut de l'honnêteté.
- Tu as voulu nous tuer.
- Jeanette, écoute.
J'avais peur
de ce que tu ferais,
ou dirais.
Tout ce pour quoi je m'étais battu
s'envolait.
Tu as voulu nous tuer ?
Je ne suis pas comme ça.
J'ai chargé Geary
de t'intimider.
J'ignorais qu'il irait
jusqu'au meurtre.
J'allais oublier.
Là, elles sont pareilles.
Merci, Christine.
Petit bonhomme,
content de t'avoir connu.
Rends-moi service.
Ecoute toujours ta mère.
Ne l'oublie jamais.
Mon bébé...
- Merci.
- Bonne chance.
Dis au revoir, mon coeur.
Broots a détourné
les détecteurs.
On a 10 minutes.
Allons revoir ces dossiers
et fichons le camp.
ll n'y a plus rien.
Si Raines savait
qu'on les avait trouvés,
on serait morts.
Si c'est pas lui,
alors qui ?

Qui suis-je ?
J'ai été acheté ou volé ?
Où sont mes parents ?
- C'est ma mère ?
- Oui.
ll s'appelle Angelo.
ll absorbe les caractéristiques
des autres
et devient cette personne.
- Qu'est-il arrivé à ma mère ?
- Je l'ai tuée.
Je me torture à m'en persuader.
Raines est dangereux.
ll est peut-être lié
à la mort de Mme Parker.
Je fantasme sur son meurtre.
Ceux qui connaissent le SL-27
sont morts ou dans le coma.
SL-27, niveau souterrain 27.
- C'est quoi ?
- Une table d'accouchement.
Avec des chaînes ?
Tu connais la routine.
Serre bien les chaînes.
- Même Houdini serait coincé.
- Serre.
Pourquoi ? ll n'est pas réglo ?
ll joue avec des cartes truquées.
ll a déjà mordu un gardien.
ll aimait pas
sa façon de le regarder.
ll va falloir le rééduquer.
Signé, scellé, prêt à livrer.
Je savais
que ses cartes étaient truquées.
Un avant-goût de ton avenir.
ll faut toujours
irriguer ses gencives.
Je le fais chaque soir.
Bien. Et ton frère ?
Pas lui.
Ma sucette, lke !
On peut essayer, Dr Jarod,
mais Ca sera toujours un Bêta.
- Un Bêta ?
- Et un Brave.
C'est là-dedans.
''Bêta laisse sa chambre
en désordre.
''Brave fait toujours son lit.''
Une leçon de morale pour enfants.
Fascinant.
Je lirai ça.
Le détenu
a pris le contrôle du fourgon.
J'ai parlé avec les gardiens
qui ont survécu.
J'ai cru qu'il allait
tous nous tuer.
Super !
ll n'arrêtait pas de sourire,
comme si ça l'amusait.
ll nous a enfermés
à l'arrière du fourgon.
On pouvait à peine respirer.
J'ai cru mourir.
Un détachement spécial du FBl
dirigé par l'agent Korkos
est sur la trace du criminel.
On ignore l'identité de l'évadé.
Le fuyard mesure 1,82 m
et pèse 79 kg.
ll a une brûlure
à la main droite.
Nous vous tiendrons au courant
au fur et à mesure.
Super !
ll est incorrigible, Dr Jarod.
- Tu dois parler.
- Non.
Pourquoi ?
L'anticipation de la douleur
est pire que la douleur.
ll est à la limite.
Ne discute pas avec moi.
Vas-y.
Tu m'as brûlé la main !
Salaud !
Emmenez-le à l'infirmerie !
Jamais je ne te ferais du mal.
Jamais je ne te ferais du mal.
Une violente évasion
terrifie les gardiens
Vous avez été en contact avec lui ?
Oui, mais ça n'était pas
toujours lui.
ll était différent à chaque fois.
ll parlait en médecin,
en astronaute...
Les psychologues appellent ça...
personnalités multiples.
En quelque sorte.
ll était bizarre.
Après 10 ans de taule,
personne ne savait qui il était.
D'où son surnom de Monsieur X ?
Même lui ne savait pas
qui il était.
ll disait qu'il entendait
des voix dans sa tête.
Dans son cas,
les voix étaient vraiment là.
Quand elles lui disaient
de changer,
il rentrait dans le rôle.
Vraiment ?
Un jour, j'ai joué son jeu.
ll a dit être
inspecteur du fisc
et a rempli ma déclaration.
ll m'a obtenu un remboursement
de 4 000 dollars.
Je me demandais
où il gardait ça.
ll griffonnait là-dedans
après le départ du médecin.
Je décide de qui vit ou meurt
Ca signifie quoi ?
Qu'il est dangereux.
Le nom de son médecin ?
Je l'appelais Dr Asthmatic.
Je sais que c'est impoli,
mais il respirait drôlement.
Normal, avec la bouteille
d'oxygène qu'il traînait.
On donne à Angelo
tous les cahiers rouges
de Jarod.
Dites-moi
ce que votre cobaye va en faire.
Etant donné qu'Angelo
peut absorber toutes les données,
il pourra peut-être
déterminer où est Jarod,
d'un point de vue
émotionnel et physique.
Dans ce cas,
voyons ce que donne l'Eponge.
Pose ça, Angelo.
Remettez-le à sa place.
J'ai le droit de l'utiliser.
Au-dessous de moi, nul ne peut
autoriser son utilisation.
Mon père
n'est pas au-dessous de vous.
Ca doit marcher.
Sinon, je risque mes fesses.
Plutôt une autre partie du corps.
Harriet à l'appareil.
Aérez, ça empeste ici !
On sait d'où vient l'appel ?
Un ami a averti Harriet
de l'évasion de M. X.
L'appel a été localisé.
Agent Jarod Ness.
washington m'envoie.
- Ness ?
- Aucun lien de parenté.
Bienvenue à bord.
L'évadé est surnommé M. X.
En 10 ans,
on n'a rien trouvé sur lui.
Ni antécédents ni empreintes,
ni ADN. Rien.
Comme s'il tombait du ciel.
Condamné
pour une série de délits
qui s'est achevée
par l'enlèvement
de Harriet Tashman.
Vous marchez
dans sa soupe.
Toutes ses victimes
étaient terrifiées.
Ce malade aime
la torture psychologique.
ll a suivi Mme Tashman
pendant deux jours
avant de la menacer
à bout portant.
Mme Tashman
a eu un accident de voiture.
Tous deux ont été blessés.
Elle a ainsi échappé à son sort.
C'était il y a 10 ans.
- ll la cherche encore ?
- Je suppose.
Avant l'enlèvement,
il agissait au hasard.
ll voulait clairement
l'emmener quelque part.
Autrefois, il la cherchait
et Ca semble encore être le cas.
Vous n'avez pas fini ?
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Le gérant de la résidence.
Sa déposition.
J'en ai fait une à l'autre.
L'autre ?
L'agent du FBl de ce matin.
On va où ?
Je vous dirai quand vous arrêter.
On ne fume pas.
- Moi ?
- Le type invisible d'à côté.
Eteignez-moi ça.
- Je viens de l'allumer.
- Je m'en moque !
Eteignez-la !
Comme vous voudrez.
Calmez-vous, Mlle Parker.
ll faut de la patience.
Ne me parlez pas de patience.
ll me faut un coup de pouce,
de quoi faire sursauter
le cobaye.
ll n'a pas cillé, souri ou bougé.
Rien.
Angelo absorbe
les cahiers
par ordre chronologique.
ll en est à 1975
et je l'ai vu tiquer vers 1969.
En voyant le cahier
sur Marilyn Monroe, il a gloussé.
Je n'aurais jamais dû
vous écouter.
C'est une perte de temps.
- Sam !
- Lâche-la !
Angelo, lâche-la !
Ca va, Mlle Parker ?
C'était quoi, ça ?
Une réaction violente à ce qu'il
a vu dans le cahier rouge.
ll n'est pas rouge.
Le cahier qu'il absorbait...
est bleu.
Enlèvement d'Harriet Tashman
L'agression de Harriet Tashman,
ancienne religieuse, est un choc.
Ses blessures sont légères
et il semble
qu'elle ne porte pas plainte.
Un porte-parole de la police
nous explique
que l'affaire est classée.
Mon Dieu !
Maman...
ll m'a fait peur.
Heureusement, tu n'as rien.
Angelo a toujours été un mystère.
Quelque chose te tracasse ?
M. Raines est furieux
que tu utilises Angelo.
Pauvre Dracula !
Angelo est son projet. M. Raines
craint qu'il ne devienne violent.
- C'est un chewing-gum.
- ll t'a attaquée.
Ca justifie
l'inquiétude de Raines.
L'inquiétude ?
Ca va te déplaire,
mais il agit dans ton dos.
ll n'oserait pas me défier.
Pardon, papa,
ce ton ne convient pas.
Tu as peut-être raison.
Raines me semblait loyal,
mais il a changé
depuis le départ de Jarod.
- S'il y avait quelque chose...
- C'est le cas.
Tu as un élément tangible ?
Si jamais tu trouves quelque chose,
quelque chose de fiable...
Je t'en ferai part immédiatement.
Grand-père était gardien ici,
avant moi.
Mlle Harriet, la propriétaire,
m'a donné la place de grand-père
à sa mort.
Elle envoie de l'argent
pour que ça reste joli.
C'est drôle !
Drôle ?
Qu'elle veuille que ça reste joli.
Elle est pas venue
depuis 10 ans.
Vous savez
où on peut la trouver ?
Non, je lui ai pas parlé.
Parfois, je me demande
si c'est elle qui envoie l'argent.
Vous avez déjà vu cette femme ?
- Je dois y aller.
- Joe Bill !
C'est ma mère.
Je ne sais pas où elle est.
J'ai jamais connu ma maman.
J'ai toujours été seul
avec grand-père.
ll dit qu'on doit pas
parler d'eux.
Qu'ils habitent pas ici.
lls habitaient ici ?
Dans la grange.
lls sortaient presque jamais.
Toujours seuls.
Elle avait les cheveux roux.
Et lui,
il faisait des avions en bois.
Toujours des avions.
Quand j'étais petit,
Mlle Harriet m'a appris
à lire correctement.
Ces gens
faisaient penser au livre
sur la fille
qui vivait dans un grenier.
Elle s'appelait...
Anne.
Anne Frank ?
La famille
qui se cachait des nazis ?
Se cachait...
lls sont partis après
l'enlèvement de Mlle Harriet.
Peut-être
qu'ils envoient l'argent ?
Joe Bill, vous savez
où ils sont allés ?
lls sont partis.
lls ont laissé des affaires.
lci Meadow. On a une piste
pour M. X. Korkos vous attend.
J'arrive.
Je reviendrai.
Le chauffeur de taxi
est à l'hosto. Choc psychologique.
ll a failli mourir de peur.
- Comment ?
- Les yeux ouverts de force.
Pour le forcer
à regarder quelque chose ?
Son destin. M. X a garé le taxi
face à un tunnel.
Le chauffeur a parlé ?
ll a eu la langue brûlée
par une cigarette.
ll paraît que M. X répétait :
''Je décide de qui vit ou meurt.''
Raison de plus pour le trouver
avant qu'il trouve Harriet Tashman.
Ce cahier bleu
appartenait à un autre sujet.
ll s'appelle Kyle et a participé
au programme Caméléon,
sous la direction de Raines,
qui était alors médecin.
Pas étonnant que vous ayez
plusieurs monstres.
Qu'a Kyle de particulier ?
ll a été
officiellement relâché du Centre
avant la date du cahier bleu.
Raines aurait gardé Kyle
pour un projet personnel ?
Où ça ?
SL-27...
J'ai modifié
le système de sécurité.
Ca devrait nous laisser
environ 30 minutes.
Puisqu'on manque de temps,
taisez-vous
et ouvrez l'oeil.
Si ça ne tenait qu'à moi,
je ne serais pas là.
Par ici.
Mon Dieu !
On a forcé quelqu'un
à vivre ici ?
A en juger par ces stries,
il a passé pas mal de temps
à chercher à s'évader
en griffant.
Broots ?
Au fond du couloir !
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Une invention maison.
Un ordinateur
de la 1re génération.
Celui de Raines.
ll enregistrait son travail
là-dessus ?
J'avais un ordinateur comme ça,
les premiers temps avec Jarod.
On enregistrait
ses simus là-dessus
avant de les transférer
en numérique.
Ca ne sert plus à rien.
Sauf si...
les données analogiques
sont sauvegardées.
Là ? Comment ?
Certains systèmes avaient
des mémoires sur disque dur.
Club informatique à la fac.
Faites ce que vous avez à faire.
Si c'est là-dessus,
sortez-le-moi.
Et appelez-moi.
Je vais rester seul ici ?
ll vous reste 20 minutes.
Sortez, Sydney.
Bonjour, Kyle.
C'est moi, Jarod, tu te souviens ?
On ne doit pas parler.
- D'où tu viens ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Moi non plus.
Je ne me souviens que d'ici.
Tu sais qui tu es ?
- Qu'avez-vous trouvé ?
- Des informations
sur Kyle.
J'ai réussi à transférer une simu
sur disque numérique.
Laquelle ?
ll fait chaud, je suis fatigué.
Je suis à Memphis depuis 3 jours.
Je n'arrive pas à dormir.
ll y a trop de monde
devant le motel.
Je me prépare.
Je vais entrer dans la légende.
Je vais fermer
une blessure ouverte.
Le Dr King n'est pas
un homme bien ?
Non, il divise notre pays.
On avait des lois, de l'ordre.
King n'obéit pas
et les Américains ont peur.
C'est toi qui as peur.
Non, il est dangereux.
Hoover ne peut pas l'arrêter.
C'est fini,
il doit mourir !
Qui es-tu pour en juger ?
Je décide de qui vit ou meurt.
Mon Dieu, il l'a fait.
Quoi donc ?
Raines.
ll rêvait de faire ça
avec un Caméléon.
ll pensait qu'en lui donnant
assez d'énergie négative,
il supprimerait sa moralité
et pourrait ainsi créer
un sociopathe.
Je décide de qui vit ou meurt.
Votre navire
espionnait dans nos eaux.
Reconnaissez
qu'il y a eu agression.
Plutôt mourir.
Et vous, lieutenant ?
- Jarod a peut-être raison.
- Assez !
Que faites-vous ?
Je n'aurais jamais dû
laisser faire ça.
Une médaille d'aviation ?
On t'a donné ça ?
Non, je l'ai toujours eue.
Le Dr Raines te la laisse ?
Le Dr Raines est mon ami.
Un pliage.
Je t'apprendrai à en faire.
Tu es enfermé où ?
Je descends par l'ascenseur.
Je ne sais pas trop où,
mais il y a
du bruit au plafond.
Les bouches d'aération.
Moi aussi, j'entends ces bruits.
On doit être proches.
Le haut-parleur par lequel
ils s'adressent à nous
est relié à un fil ?
Oui. Pourquoi ?
Je crois savoir
comment on peut parler
sans qu'ils nous entendent.
Qu'avez-vous fait de Kyle ?
Pas de suicide politique
pour une histoire ancienne !
Vous avez désobéi à la Tour
en gardant Kyle
après la date de sa libération.
Si j'étais vous,
j'oublierais le passé.
Jarod est votre bouée.
Plus il reste dehors,
plus votre influence
sur lui diminue.
Je vous jure
que si Kyle est vivant,
je le retrouverai.
Cet enfoiré
peut être n'importe où.
Voici le profil de M. X établi
par nos génies de la psychologie.
En résumé,
c'est une bombe
prête à exploser.
Dorénavant, je lance un 2-1 -1 1 .
Un ordre de tuer ?
M. X est imprévisible,
mais il n'a tué personne.
Vous parlez en recrue
de l'ère Clinton.
ll s'agit d'un tordu
qui a brûlé la langue d'un type.
Vous pensez pouvoir le raisonner ?
D'ici 30 minutes,
la prochaine simu...
Je reviens dans 15 minutes
Les enfants, c'est l'heure
du dessin animé d'oncle Buddy.
J'adore cette émission.
Et voici le bulletin
d'informations de Wendy Barret.
Tandis que le FBl
poursuit son enquête
sur l'évadé de prison
connu sous le nom de M. X,
les pistes viennent à manquer
pour localiser
et appréhender...
Que fais-tu ici ?
L'agent Korkos fait appel
à la population
pour aider à son arrestation.
Une récompense est offerte.
Attends !
Je ne voulais pas !
SL-27 ?
L'Eponge vous a dit ça ?
Pas avec des mots,
mais c'était le sens.
M. X., c'est Kyle.
lls vivaient là-haut.
Pas très propre.
Je suis jamais monté ici.
Pas le droit.
Tout est resté tel quel
depuis leur départ ?
Je crois.
ll m'en avait fait un pour Noël.
Ca me plaisait.
ll y avait un bébé ?
Je l'entendais pleurer.
Je l'ai jamais vu.
J'avais pas le droit de monter.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Mon tas de compost.
Des yeux
qui me regardent d'en haut.
De petits yeux.
Qui regardent fixement.
lls me faisaient peur.
J'ai jamais vu le bébé.
Mais le bébé m'a vu.
''Et entre les mains de Dieu,
''les enfants
ne seront jamais perdus.''
Vous n'allez pas y croire.
Montrez-moi.
Heureusement, vous êtes seul.
Pourquoi ?
Je ne suis pas Scoubidou.
Quel est le problème ?
Je sais
que vous ne me respectez pas,
mais ne regardez pas ça.
Envoyez le disque.
La haine régente la réalité.
Plus tu te concentres
sur ton ennemi,
plus vite tu auras le contrôle.
C'est plus qu'un mot.
La haine est un sentiment.
Je l'éprouve.
Très bien.
Sens-la grandir.
Laisse-la grandir.
Demain, je t'emmène
à la Maison du Dragon.
Je m'y sens en sécurité.
Ce sera toujours le cas.
ll lui apprenait
à haïr ma mère,
à tirer sur ma mère...
Désolé, Mlle Parker.
Voilà pourquoi Angelo
vous a attaquée.
Je dois prévenir mon père.
S'il n'est pas déjà au courant.
On est au Centre.
ll s'agit de la mort de ma mère.
Tout ce qu'on a appris
remonte au SL-27.
Si quelqu'un s'en aperçoit...
Seul votre coeur
sait à quel point votre père
mérite votre confiance.
Soyez prudente.
Navré que vous ayez vu ça.
Je vous respecte.
Au secours !
''Je décide de qui vit ou meurt.''
Mon rapport.
Je t'apporte du nouveau.
Kyle est resté ici 10 ans
après sa soi-disant libération.
Où se déroulaient
ces expériences ?
Je n'en suis pas sûre.
Comment as-tu découvert,
pour Raines...
Tu m'as appris mon métier, papa.
Tu as des preuves ?
Tu pourrais croire ta fille.
Oui, mais il me faut du concret.
J'ai une source. Ca suffit ?
J'aurais dû m'en douter.
Encore des mauvaises herbes
semées par Jarod.
Jarod n'est pour rien
dans ce que j'ai découvert.
Selon le rapport,
Raines a appris des choses
à Kyle... Lesquelles ?
Haïr.
Tuer.
Tuer ? Qui ?
Je n'en suis pas encore sûre.
Tu savais ce que faisait Raines ?
Jamais je n'aurais accepté ça !
Autrefois,
j'étais au courant de tout ici.
Mon époque est peut-être finie.
Désolée, papa.
Laisse-moi m'en occuper.
Je te rapporterai
la meilleure preuve tangible
qui soit.
Laquelle ?
Kyle.
Tu m'entends ?
Où es-tu ?
A trois portes du couloir.
Et toi ?
A quatre portes.
Juste à côté de toi.
Tu as entendu ?
Oui, peut-être qu'ils savent.
Tu crois que oui ?
Quelqu'un sait.
Parlez-moi
de la Maison du Dragon.
C'est une chambre de torture ?
Un asile du Centre ?
Un lieu sûr ?
ll s'agit de Kyle, hein ?
Kyle est là-bas.
ll devait tuer mes parents ?
Je ne sais pas, je te le jure.
Je trouverai des réponses.
Vite, Sydney.
Je vous en prie.
Broots, j'ai besoin de vous.
Piratez l'ordinateur
de M. Raines.
Comment vont tes gencives ?
Elles sont roses.
Je me demandais...
Je vous aiderais volontiers.
New England Air ?
Je voudrais
un aller-retour pour Boston.
On a enfin quelque chose.
Un témoin a vu M. X
essayer d'ouvrir un distributeur
à Boston.
- Qui est le témoin ?
- Un gosse du nom de Betaski.
- C'est lui ?
- La cicatrice...
C'est lui !
Foster, Caine, Charles,
on va à Boston.
Je m'en occupe.
Et moi ?
ll faudra être prêt à tirer
quand je lui dirai
d'éteindre sa cigarette.
Ne discutez pas, vous restez ici.
Génial, corvée de bureau !
La Maison du Dragon se trouve
à Delphi Shores,
dans le New Jersey.
Raines risque d'aller
droit là-bas lui aussi.
Comme tu le sais, je dois
en parler à Mlle Parker.
Vas-y et tu ne seras pas seul.
J'ai laissé la solitude au Centre.
Une dernière chose.
Si tu trouves Kyle,
sache qu'il n'est plus
celui que tu as connu.
Moi non plus.
Dites-moi où ils sont.
Je ne peux pas.
ll paraît
que l'anticipation de la douleur
est bien pire
que la douleur elle-même.
On va le découvrir.
Je m'appelle Jarod,
je viens vous aider.
Trop tard.
Elle est avec moi.
J'adore les réunions de classe.
Je n'aurais pas dû
vous laisser vous voir.
Allons-y, messieurs.
Je n'irai nulle part avec vous.
Moi non plus.
Attrapez-les !
Tu me connais, je suis Jarod.
On m'a dit que Jarod était mort.
Je décide de qui vit ou meurt.
Pas cette fois.
C'est le gros lot !
Non, Jarod !
Lequel ?
Attrapez Kyle !
Montez !
Vous auriez pu nous faire tuer.
Pourquoi m'avoir empêché
de tirer ?
Parce que Kyle est votre frère.

En effet.

Qu'est-il arrivé à ma mère ?
Je l'ai tuée.
Je me torture à m'en persuader.
Raines est dangereux.

qui s'est achevée par
l'enlèvement de Harriet Tashman.
Maman...

et a participé
au programme Caméléon
sous la direction de Raines,
alors médecin.
Je décide de qui vit ou meurt.
ll lui apprenait à haïr ma mère,
à tirer sur ma mère.
Je décide de qui vit ou meurt.
Pas cette fois.
Lequel ?
Attrapez Kyle !
Pourquoi m'avoir empêché
de tirer ?
Kyle est votre frère.
Je ne me souviens pas
de mes parents ou d'un frère.
On vous a enlevé très jeune.
Souvent, on refoule, on oublie.
Comment les avez-vous connus ?
Mes parents sont morts
quand j'avais 11 ans.
J'ai grandi dans un couvent.
Je voulais donner ma vie
pour servir l'Eglise.
J'ai prononcé mes voeux,
je suis restée cloîtrée,
mais ça n'a pas marché.
Ma famille était liée au couvent ?
ll y avait
une certaine Catherine Jamison.
On faisait enrager
la mère supérieure.
Un soir, on a traversé
un étang gelé en cachette.
J'ai glissé et failli me noyer.
Catherine a plongé et m'a ramenée
à la vie par son souffle.
Elle n'est pas devenue religieuse,
mais jamais
je n'ai atteint sa spiritualité,
malgré des années de prière.
En quittant le convent,
elle a épousé un certain...
Catherine Parker.
- Vous l'avez connue ?
- Sa fille.
Quel rapport avait-elle
avec mes parents ?
En 1969,
l'année où j'ai hérité
de cette ferme,
j'ai su
que Catherine avait besoin d'aide.
Elle m'a demandé
de donner refuge
à un homme et une femme dont
les deux fils avaient été enlevés.
Mes parents sont venus
à ce moment-là ?
Pour moi, ils s'appelaient
Charles et Margaret.
lls avaient peur.
Depuis des années,
ils cherchaient et fuyaient.
lls étaient en sécurité, ici.
C'étaient des gens merveilleux.
Vous seriez très fier d'eux.
lls parlaient de mon frère
ou de moi ?
lls n'en parlaient pas,
moi non plus.
C'était trop dur,
surtout pour votre père.
Ses fils lui manquaient beaucoup.
lls savaient
qui nous avait enlevés ?
Votre père craignait
pour la santé de votre mère.
Le bébé ?
Elle a eu une petite fille
le mois suivant.
J'ai une soeur.
Elle s'appelle Emily.
Hélas, il n'y a pas de photos.
Des années après,
j'ai reçu des menaces de Kyle.
ll devait savoir
que j'étais liée à vos parents.
J'ignorais alors qui il était.
ll était désespéré.
ll pensait que je pouvais l'aider.
C'est après l'enlèvement
que votre famille a disparu.
Depuis, ils se cachaient ici.
Je savais que Kyle était en prison
et je connaissais sa colère...
sa souffrance.
J'avais perdu contact avec
Catherine Parker depuis longtemps.
Je me sentais seule
et j'avais peur.
Alors, je me suis cachée.
Vos parents vous aimaient.
Votre frère et vous,
vous leur manquiez.
Tu te rappelles où tu étais
à ton arrivée au Centre ?
Au début, à trois portes
de l'entrée du couloir.
Ensuite, au niveau...
Qu'était la Solution Manchester ?
La Solution Manchester...
Je ne me rappelle
aucune solution.
Le travail a été saboté.
J'aurais pu le faire seul !
Les autres ont perdu
leur volonté. Pas moi.
Je décide de qui vit ou meurt.
ll devait tout avoir oublié
après ces années de prison !
ll ne se souvient pas de tout.
C'est déjà trop !
Jarod nous gêne assez.
- Pourquoi est-il ici ?
- A ma demande.
Qui est Kyle ?
Ou devrais-je dire ''quoi'' ?
Je m'occupe de Kyle.
Tu as raté Jarod.
Malgré une belle occasion.
Je sais que tu es contrariée.
J'aurais dû te dire
que M. Raines était sur le coup.
Je m'excuse,
mais tout est allé très vite.
M. Raines et moi,
on s'occupe de Kyle.
- Mais papa...
- Non, fais-moi confiance.
Pensez-vous que Jarod
reviendra au Centre ?
ll n'y a rien
que Jarod veuille ici
et il a toujours un objectif.
Même si on ignore
comment il s'est évadé,
nos progrès en matière de sécurité
dépassent les capacités de tous.
Même de Jarod.
C'est la 1re fois que
vous doutez des capacités de Jarod.
Espérons qu'ils y ont cru
autant que vous.
lls arrivent !
Emmenez-le !
Au secours ! Lâchez-moi !
Jarod, aide-moi !
Vous avez dit
que c'était important.
Aidez-moi à approcher Kyle.
Pourquoi ?
ll sait quelque chose
sur la mort de ma mère.
Vous voulez que je vous supplie ?
Pourquoi Kyle vous aiderait-il ?
Parce que c'était le cobaye
de M. Raines.
Je le sens.
Je sens que Kyle sait
qui a tué ma mère.
ll est enfermé dans une zone
à laquelle je n'ai pas accès.
ll est surveillé 24 h/24
depuis la salle de contrôle.
Personne ne peut y accéder
sans se faire repérer.
Ca n'est pas entièrement vrai.
Comment ça ?
Je nous ai fait accéder
au niveau souterrain 27, non ?
Je pourrais sans doute
dévier les détecteurs
et couper la caméra
à un moment donné.
Pour combien de temps ?
Suffisamment longtemps.
Je cherchais...
lci...
C'est chaud !
Je suis désolé...
Vous êtes son portrait craché.
C'est ce qu'on dit.
C'est vous qui décidez
de qui vit ou meurt ?
Vous connaissez mon travail.
Vous avez tué ma mère ?
Non.
Alors, qui ?
C'était M. Raines ?
Que faites-vous ici ?
Je cherchais les nouveaux bureaux
de la comptabilité.
Pourquoi je me dis
que vous mentez ?
Ouvrez la porte.
Sortez-le de là.
Mes parents devaient adorer
cet endroit.
Je connais peut-être quelqu'un
qui peut vous aider.
Qui ?
Les voeux sacrés ont la vie dure.
Je dois aller les voir.
Seule.
C'est trop dangereux.
Catherine n'a pas pensé à elle
en me tirant de l'étang gelé.
Je vais m'absenter
quelques jours.
Je ne serai pas là.
Depuis mon évasion,
je cherche des indices
qui me mèneraient à mon passé.
Et le plus gros indice
est là où tout a commencé.
Je ne comprends pas.
Je vais retrouver mon frère.
Je retourne au Centre.
Mon Dieu !
Comment es-tu entré ?
Comme je suis sorti.
Pourquoi ne pas m'avoir parlé
de ma famille, de mon frère ?
Ton frère ?
Kyle.
Du moins,
je crois que c'est son nom.
- Pourquoi ne m'avoir rien dit ?
- Je ne savais pas.
C'est intéressant.
Vous dites toujours ça.
Je te jure que je ne savais pas.
Tout ce que je sais de Kyle...
c'est ce que m'a dit Jacob.
Je vous dérange ?
Non, je relisais quelques notes.
Bien sûr.
Toujours aussi consciencieux.
Vous me préviendrez
si Jarod
essaie de vous contacter ?
Et s'il vous contacte d'abord ?
Jarod, aide-moi !
Tes cheveux...
Cracker Jack...
C.J.
Tu es C.J.
C'est toi qui as écrit à Kyle
en prison.
Tu étais en contact avec lui
et avec moi.
Cette procédure radicale
ne se fait plus depuis longtemps.
La Tour n'a pas encore donné
son accord.
J'ai fait le diagnostic.
Seule la séparation du lobe
frontal lui apportera la paix.
A moins que vous n'ayez
un autre avis.
J'appelle l'anesthésiste.
ll sera prêt dans 10 minutes.
Vous êtes qui ?
Je suis Jarod.
Raines a dit que tu étais mort.
Loin de là.
Pourquoi tu m'aides ?
Parce que je suis ton frère.
Je n'ai pas de famille.
Si.
Je suppose que c'est notre père
qui t'a donné ça ?
Mon Dieu !
- Tu l'as gardée ?
- Pas moi.
Lui.
ll est temps qu'on soit libres.
Pas de blessés !
Où on va ?
A la maison.
Par ici, Angelo.
Je décide de qui vit ou meurt.
Comment est-ce arrivé ?
lls sont au niveau souterrain 19.
J'y vais.
Je dois parler à M. Parker.
- Par ici.
- Ca mène où ?
Dehors.
Niveau souterrain 19.
Broots, où sont-ils ?
J'y travaille.
Niveau souterrain 20.
Je reçois
un signal
par le détecteur de mouvement.
lls sont
dans le système d'aération.
Décrochez ça !
Mon Dieu, mais c'est La Chose !
C'est Angelo.
Fais-moi confiance.
Dis-moi
que ça n'était pas toi, papa.
Je n'ai pas autorisé
la procédure.
Jamais je n'aurais fait ça.
Raines était prêt à détruire
un investissement du Centre,
sans directive de la Tour,
pour se protéger
de ce que sait Kyle.
On le sait depuis longtemps.
Raines a assez fait cavalier seul.
On s'occupera de lui.
Ramène-moi
ce qui appartient au Centre.
Tout va bien.
Tiens.
Une des joies de la liberté.
ll y a des bonbons
sous la tête.
J'en ai plein d'autres.
On va rouler longtemps ?
Je sais où on peut s'arrêter.
Mais à vrai dire...
la fuite est sans fin.
Tu es sorti quand ?
Ca fait presque un an.
ll y a plein de choses dehors.
Tu as tant à découvrir.
Tu t'en souviens.
Ce Kyle a un million d'années.
A mon évasion,
j'avais le cerveau en bouillie.
Je ne pensais
qu'à retrouver mes...
nos parents.
J'écrasais tous les obstacles.
J'ai vite eu
la police aux trousses.
Quand j'ai retrouvé Harriet...
je ne lui voulais pas de mal.
Je pensais
qu'elle savait où ils étaient.
Ca a eu un effet positif.
Au moins, on a un point de départ.
Voilà le reste.
C'est tout ce qu'on a :
cahiers de Jarod, fiches du FBl...
ll a presque fini.
Vous êtes masochiste.
Aux grands maux,
les grands remèdes.
Si l'Eponge peut devenir
n'importe qui,
comme les charlatans
le prétendent,
je le laisse devenir à la fois
Kyle et Jarod.
ll me dira peut-être
où ils sont.
On aurait dû l'attacher.
N'est-ce pas
une hypothèse erronée,
- Dr Parker ?
- ll va péter un fusible ?
Vous pensez qu'il veut vous aider.
Pourquoi pas ?
Laissez faire ce charlatan.
Jarod, si tu es vraiment là,
tu sais qui je suis,
tu sais que je peux t'aider
et aussi que moi seul
peux te protéger de M. Raines.
Je rentre à la maison.
On est en sécurité, là-bas.
Kyle a kidnappé Harriet Tashman.
ll essayait de l'emmener là-bas.
Je les sens ici.
Je sais.
Mais ils n'ont pas de visage.
Parce qu'on ne s'en souvient pas
ou que le Centre
nous en a empêchés.
Ca nous aidera peut-être.
Elle est belle.
lls sont toujours en vie, hein ?
Oui...
et notre soeur aussi.
Elle est née après notre départ.
Papa m'a appris.
On va les retrouver.
Sinon, on ne serait pas allés
si loin.
Korkos !
Vous voulez savoir où est M. X ?
On ignorait que c'était vous.
Ca va,
on veut tous la même chose.
J'ai de bonnes nouvelles.
Quelqu'un vient !
Allons-nous-en !
Attrapez-les !
- Laissez-moi regarder.
- Partez !
J'ai la jambe cassée.
Je ne te laisserai pas ici !
Pars et retrouve nos parents !
Ne leur dis pas
ce que je suis devenu.
Vite, Jarod !
Pas un geste ! FBl !
- Séparons-nous.
- Je peux vous protéger.
ll ne s'agit pas de moi.
Vos parents
sont à Boston.
lls arriveront en taxi
devant ce café.
Voici l'adresse.
Comment vont mes parents ?
Vous jugerez par vous-même.
Demain à 15 h.
Merci, Harriet.
On a agi prudemment avec Kyle.
Comme ça,
on garde les mains propres.
ll faut ramener Jarod.
On a une piste.
Où ? Quand ?
15 h, aujourd'hui.
Prenez des nettoyeurs.
Ramenez-le.
- Sans filet.
- lnutile, Mlle Parker.
M. Raines
ne sera pas de cet avis.
Je sais.
Voilà comment
enlever le cran de sécurité.
Pas question
que Jarod soit blessé.
Je ferai de mon mieux.
Tout chaud et prêt à partir.
Vous allez vers l'est.
Et vous, allez vers l'ouest.
Bonjour, Jarod.
Vous m'avez volé à mes parents.
Vous avez fait tuer mon frère
par le FBl.
Et vous voulez tuer ma famille.
Qu'est-ce que je vous ai fait ?
Vous existez.
Je refuse de connaître
le même sort que mon frère.
Laissez-moi tranquille.
Je croyais qu'il avait arrêté
de fumer.
Non, il n'y avait pas d'indic.
On a appris le rendez-vous
parce que le couvent
est sur écoute depuis 30 ans.
Bien, M. Lyle.
Mais Jarod s'est enfui...
Vous voulez que je vienne ?
Pourquoi ?
Comme vous voudrez.
J'arrive tout de suite.
Oui, vous avez ma parole. Merci.
Content de te voir.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui, on a du travail.
''On'' ?
Raines est entre les mains
du médecin ou de Dieu...
Les greffes de peau
sont délicates.
ll te laisse le champ libre.
C'est ce que tu voulais !
- Pas toi ?
- ll a dépassé les limites.
Je me suis occupé de lui.
Alors que faisait-il hier
dans la rue ?
Pourquoi savait-il
où serait Jarod ?
Raines ne pouvait pas
finir à l'hôpital
en restant derrière son bureau,
non ?
Tu avais promis qu'on parlerait.
Raines a-t-il tué ma mère ?
ll n'y a pas de réponses faciles.
Oui ou non ?
Un jour, tu comprendras...
Est-ce qu'il l'a tuée ?
La mort de ta mère
a encore des répercussions.
Quand je pourrai en dire plus,
je le ferai.
Fais-moi confiance.
Vous venez me chercher ?
Bien entendu.
Un ami m'a envoyé ça.
Le rapport balistique.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Je ne suis pas.
La balle qui a touché
la bouteille d'oxygène...
on ignore
quelle arme l'a tirée.
Sydney à l'appareil.
- Qui est-ce ?
- Je suis fatigué...
mais je n'abandonne pas.
Je m'en doute bien.
Je les retrouverai.
Personne ne me séparera
de ma famille.
Je comprends.
Tu étais plus proche de ta famille
que je ne l'ai jamais été.
Je veux que tu le croies.
Si vous voulez ma confiance,
dites-moi
où mon frère est enterré.
- Enterré ?
- Oui, Kyle...
Dites-le-moi.
Le réservoir du fourgon
était plein.
ll a brûlé pendant très longtemps.
On n'a rien retrouvé. Rien.
Nada.
C'est ce que vous me laissez.
- Tu m'entends ?
- Je suis là.
Après tout ce qui s'est passé,
ils sont plus décidés que jamais
à te retrouver.
Tu sais où aller ?
J'ai une bonne idée.
Attrapez-moi si vous pouvez.
Adaptation

Sous-titrage
NlCE FELLOw
Vu dans Le Caméléon :
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Ton frère.
Va-t'en !
Trouve nos parents.
Vous avez fait tuer mon frère.
Je vous ai fait quoi ?
Vous existez.
On a tiré sur Raines.
Mais la balle,
on ignore de quelle arme
elle venait.
Mon père n'a pas disparu
comme ça.
Je ne suis pas sa secrétaire.
Vous devez savoir où il est.
Je déteste l'arrogance.
Un problème au Centre ?
Mon père est à son bureau
à 7h depuis 35 ans.
Depuis 1 5 jours, personne.
C'est bizarre.
ll se passe des choses étranges
dans la Tour, ces derniers temps.
lls ont augmenté les prix,
aux distributeurs.
Le paquet de chips
est passé à 1 $.
C'est vrai !
Avouons-le,
ça a changé depuis...
Dites-le, Broots.
Depuis qu'on a tiré sur Raines.
Ne me regardez pas.
Je ne suis pas tireur d'élite.
Moi, je voulais pas d'arme.
Si j'avais tiré sur le tubard,
il serait mort,
pas au pavillon
des grands brûlés.
Excusez-moi.
J'ai rencontré des tas d'hommes
de tous les corps de métier
qui se retiraient ici,
mais frère Jarod
était sans pareil.
ll ne quittait pas sa cellule,
mangeait à peine,
ne dormait jamais.
Mais vu la violence
de ses cauchemars,
c'est compréhensible.
Son âme débordait de tristesse.
Pas vraiment Maisons & Jardins.
- Le jour des morts.
- Une fête mexicaine,
proche de votre Halloween,
où les cimetières
se préparent
à recevoir les défunts.
Ces images morbides
expliquent
le long silence de Jarod.
ll est hanté
par l'idée de la mort.
A propos, regardez ça.
- Un cercueil artisanal.
- Jarod l'a fait.
ll ne s'en séparait pas.
On dirait le cahier bleu
de son frère Kyle.
Jarod rêve.
ll fait le deuil de son frère.
Pour qui est ce cercueil ?
Expliquez-nous, Dr Freud.
Quelqu'un va mourir.
Qui veut le toucher ?
T'es malsain.
Courage.
On va en disséquer toute l'année.
Touche pas le cadavre
avant que le prof arrive.
Fernando, ça fait un an
que j'attends ça.
Et puis, je crois pas
que ça le dérange.
Erreur !
Qui êtes-vous ?
Jarod Howard,
votre nouveau professeur.
C'est pas drôle.
Et se moquer des morts ?
Sachez qu'il y a une chose
impardonnable ici.
Je ne tolérerai pas qu'on manque
de respect à ces cadavres.
Sous chaque housse en plastique,
il y a un être humain.
La plupart
sont des inconnus.
Ce qui signifie
qu'ils sont morts seuls,
effrayés,
sans amis, sans foyer.
Oubliés des leurs
et rejetés par la société.
Par conséquent,
ils seront respectés ici.
Ecoutez-moi bien.
Halloween approche.
Si je vous prends à apporter
une tête ou un bras à une fête,
je veillerai personnellement
à vous renvoyer.
On aura assez de cadavres ?
Qui est malsain ?
ll reste des cadavres prédisséqués
du semestre dernier.
Je veux être chirurgienne.
Je dois me faire la main.
La théorie ne suffit pas.
On va recevoir
des cadavres
après les cours.
ll me faut deux volontaires.
Je crois que ces deux-là
feront l'affaire.
Enfin ! Dieu merci,
tu es revenu, papa.
On a la piste de Jarod.
Je ferai analyser ça,
mais qui sait
ce qu'il mijote ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Mlle Parker, je suppose.
Vous ressemblez à votre mère.
Où est mon père ?
ll est absent, à ce que je vois.
- M. Lyle, la personne est là.
- Faites-la entrer.
M. Lyle, que faites-vous
dans le bureau de mon père ?
Je le remplace.
Brigitte,
vous connaissez Mlle Parker ?
C'est la nouvelle nettoyeuse.
La nouvelle nettoyeuse ?
L'analyse des fibres.
Mes premières conclusions.
Elle a vu la planque de Jarod
avant nous ?
Entre nous,
Brigitte vous a devancés.
D'à peine deux jours.
C'est La 4e dimension ?
Nous avons cru bon
que Brigitte
vous aide à capturer Jarod.
Je n'ai pas besoin d'aide.
Et ''nous'', qui est-ce ?
Moi.
La direction veut changer
de tactique.
Elle déplore votre inefficacité.
Jarod court toujours.
Je ne comprends pas.
Est-ce si dur
d'attraper un homme ?
Jarod est plus que ça.
C'est un Caméléon.
ll se fond dans le décor.
C'est un génie qui peut devenir
qui il veut.
Et il a presque trouvé
sa famille.
lmaginez les ramifications.
Nous avons avancé.
Oui. ''Nous''...
Est-ce que ce Sydney...
est un obstacle ?
Doit-on s'en débarrasser ?
Sydney a élevé Jarod.
ll y a un cordon ombilical
affectif entre eux.
Coupez-le :
vous ne reverrez jamais Jarod.
Le Centre en a assez de Jarod.
S'il est aussi malin
que vous le dites
et vous,
si maligne qu'on m'a dit,
réjouissez-vous d'être aidée.
Ca coule de source.
On va être en retard.
Si vous avez des nouvelles
de votre père, prévenez-moi.
Quel C.V. impressionnant.
Diplômé avec mention
à l'université de Londres.
Ca fait beaucoup
pour un jeune homme.
J'apprends vite.
Je suis un peu surpris
que vous souhaitiez enseigner
à des étudiants de 1 re année.
Je voulais travailler avec vous.
J'ai étudié vos travaux.
Vous avez innové avec le produit
de réanimation cardiaque.
D'après moi, c'est un mélange
d'acétylcholine et de digitaline.
C'était secret.
Avec la concurrence,
les secrets ne durent pas.
Malin ! Vous devriez être médecin,
pas chercheur.
En tout cas,
on m'appelle docteur.
Dr Howard ?
Vous voyez ?
Joel, Fernando !
Allez mettre les cadavres
dans le formol.
Joel bosse à mi-temps
aux pompes funèbres.
Jarod Howard, universitaire.
- Fein & Fein ?
- Sheldon est mon frère.
Christopher est devenu médecin
pour nous couler.
L'inspecteur Keyes est là.
Vas-y.
Elle a peut-être du nouveau.
- Je dois y aller.
- Les papiers sont sur mon bureau.
Portez-les à Sheldon.
Envoyez-les-moi.
Fernando a l'air triste.
C'est normal.
Son frère a disparu
l'an dernier à Halloween.
J'emmène ces corps au labo.
Un étudiant en médecine disparaît
Un homme cherche son frère
Qui est M. Lyle ?
ll aboie des ordres
et les huiles obéissent.
ll est peut-être du Triumvirat.
- lls viendraient faire quoi ?
- Prendre le pouvoir.
Leur apparition expliquerait
la disparition de votre père.
Sans parler du prix des chips.
Pourquoi feraient-ils
disparaîître mon père ?
Parce que quelqu'un
a tiré sur Raines.
lls ne renonceront pas
à savoir qui.
Et moi, je ne renoncerai pas
à savoir qui est M. Lyle.
Vous allez pas emménager ici !
C'est hanté, il paraîît.
La maison ?
Non, le jardin.
C'est très prisé, à Halloween.
ll y a des oeufs,
du papier toilette,
des potirons écrasés.
Pour 50 $,
je monte la garde pour vous.
J'ai entendu parler
de Halloween.
Une fête où on apporte
des bouts de cadavres ?
J'ai jamais été invité.
Par ici, les jeunes
font la fête ou jouent
à ''blague ou bonbon''.
''Blague ou bonbon'' ?
Vous sortez d'où, de Bosnie ?
Les enfants se déguisent
et demandent des bonbons aux gens.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que ça se fait.
Si on leur en donne pas,
ils cassent tout.
C'est du racket.
Vous pigez vite, le Bosniaque.
50 dollars, un bon placement.
Je m'appelle Bruno.
Pour monter la garde,
je suis votre homme.
Je prends note.
Prenez l'écarteur
et ouvrez le sternum
pour accéder au coeur.
Dire que cette chose
faisait vivre ce corps.
Pour ôter le coeur,
coupez autour du péricarde.
Maintenant, détachez
l'aorte
et les veines pulmonaires.
Ca doit être sec.
Excusez-moi.
Je vais l'aider
à ne pas salir ses chaussures.
Pour les Grecs,
le cerveau abritait la conscience.
Et que le coeur abritait l'âme.
lntéressant, ce crucifix.
J'ai vécu à Cuernavaca.
On en fait des semblables.
ll vient de là-bas.
Ma grand-mère est de Cuernavaca.
Elle nous a élevés
à la mort de nos parents.
Elle a donné le même
à mon frère Enrique
avant qu'on vienne ici.
Pour nous porter chance.
Votre frère a disparu.
Je suis désolé.
On dit parfois que le lien
fraternel peut être si fort
qu'on sent la douleur de l'autre.
Vous sentez la sienne ?
Vous avez un frère ?
Vous sentez sa douleur ?
Chaque jour.
Je sens mon frère
dans mon coeur,
mais il ne peut plus me sentir.
La chance d'Enrique a tourné.
J'espère seulement que,
quand son coeur s'est arrêté,
il n'a pas souffert.
Où suis-je ?
Jarod...
Ca faisait trop longtemps.
Une partie de ma vie manque.
Tu as l'air soucieux.
Epuisé.
Je ne peux pas dormir.
Ce sont peut-être les émotions
liées à la perte d'un parent.
- De ton frère.
- Non, je comprends cette douleur.
C'est autre chose.
Chaque fois
que je ferme les yeux,
je vais quelque part.
Un endroit horrible.
Je fais toujours
le même cauchemar éveillé,
mais je ne le finis jamais.
Je ne peux pas.
Ton subconscient refuse peut-être
d'affronter la suite.
Laisse-moi t'aider.
Dis-moi où tu es.
Dites-moi où j'étais.
Où tu étais ?
Toute ma vie est sur ces disques,
de mon enlèvement
à mon évasion.
Chaque respiration,
chaque simu,
chaque morceau de nourriture.
Sauf les 3 dernières
semaines d'octobre,
un an avant mon évasion.
- C'est une erreur.
- ll n'y a pas d'erreur.
ll manque trois semaines
de ma vie.
J'ignore comment je le sais,
mais c'est lié à ma peur...
à mon cauchemar.
Je dois savoir
ce qui s'est passé.
Ce que vous m'avez fait.
Je dois le savoir.
- Vous cherchez ?
- Je prends mes marques.
Pas dans mon bureau.
J'ai vérifié sa maison
en Ecosse et à Bemmany.
Personne n'a vu votre père.
- Larron ?
- Oui, Mlle Parker.
Si elle entre encore
dans mon bureau, je vous tue.
ll est sorti de son trou ?
On a trouvé quelque chose...
Dehors.
Evitons de parler là.
J'ai vérifié mes notes.
J'étais en Europe
dans la période
dont parle Jarod.
Les dates concordent.
J'avais été envoyé
à un congrès sans intérêt
par M. Raines.
Tout ce qui est louche ici
est signé M. Lambeaux de peau.
M. Lyle apparaîît,
votre père disparaîît.
La moitié du temps,
vous nagez dans l'ignorance
et l'autre moitié,
vous êtes un sage omniscient.
Question de survie.
Je vais retourner dans mon trou.
D'abord, vous allez m'aider
à savoir qui est M. Lyle.
Comment je dois faire ça ?
- Qui connaîît tous les secrets ?
- M. Raines.
Un point pour Captain Kangaroo.
Raines est à l'infirmerie.
Profitez-en pour consulter
son fichier sur M. Lyle.
Vous êtes folle ?
Et pendant que vous y êtes,
cherchez ce que faisait Raines
quand j'étais en Europe.
Où est le reste de l'équipe ?
Joel essaie de retenir
son déjeuner
et Chloe est allé le prendre.
Un calavera.
Vous avez vécu à Cuernavaca.
J'ai appris à faire ça là-bas.
- Vous étiez prof ?
- Non, moine.
J'ai beaucoup appris
sur cette fête.
Sur le respect qu'on porte
aux ancêtres.
Quand on était petits,
mamie nous emmenait
sur la tombe de nos parents
qu'on décorait de calaveras
qu'on avait faits.
Elle nous parlait d'eux,
nous reliait à nos racines.
Vous avez fait ça ?
- J'ignore où est ma famille.
- Je veux trouver Enrique
pour l'enterrer.
Vous êtes sûr qu'il est mort ?
La nuit où il a disparu,
il avait décidé
de ne pas aller à la fête
pour m'aider à réviser.
ll n'est jamais rentré.
Une partie de moi est morte.
La partie qui était liée
à mon frère.
Certains frères
n'ont pas ce lien.
Vous faites revenir les morts ?
Je t'ai pas entendu frapper.
C'est drôle.
Moi non plus.
En général, les adultes
se moquent d'Halloween.
Je fais une étude.
J'ai les coupures de journaux
que vous vouliez.
Maintenant,
où est ma coupure ?
Je sais que ça me regarde pas,
mais pourquoi vous vouliez
que les nécros récentes ?
Exact, ça te regarde pas.
Voilà des bonbons.
Les orange et noir
sont mes préférés.
Les orange et noir ?
Tu viens vraiment de Bosnie.
J'ai passé l'âge
de demander des bonbons.
- Tu fais quoi pour Halloween ?
- J'adore
mettre du caca de chien
dans un journal,
le poser devant chez un vieux con
et mettre le feu.
- Pourquoi ?
- Pour qu'il le piétine.
Ca doit salir ses chaussures.
Très bon !
Vous êtes là ?
Vous n'étiez pas à mon cours.
Votre groupe m'inquiète.
Vous risquez d'échouer.
Je serai à la hauteur.
ll ne s'agit pas de vous,
mais de Fernando.
Son frère n'a pas tenu.
- J'ai peur qu'il craque.
- Je connaissais Enrique.
Mais Fernando est solide.
C'est vrai, Enrique
n'a pas tenu le coup ?
Je l'ai vu craquer.
Je l'aidais à recruter
des SDF
pour le Dr Fein.
On devait chercher
un certain Broadstreet Bill.
Quand je suis arrivé
pour l'équipe de nuit,
Enrique était bizarre.
ll a appelé le Dr Fein.
Et il est rentré chez lui ?
ll est allé enterrer
quelqu'un.
A onze heures du soir ?
C'est fréquent, ici.
C'est moins cher, je crois.
Marisa,
si vous êtes morte
dans mon labo,
qui est enterré
à votre place ?
Mon Dieu !
Enrique...
On t'a enterré vivant.
Tu as refait ce cauchemar.
C'était quoi ?
Une expérience
sur des narcotiques ?
Du gaz neurotoxique ?
Ou une l.R.M. de l'enfer ?
En tout cas,
ça a été fait à mon insu.
J'étais en Europe
pendant la période manquante.
Je fais de mon mieux
pour te répondre.
Vous pensez parfois à la mort ?
Chaque jour, je me dis
que c'est peut-être le dernier.
Vous êtes malade ?
Je travaille au Centre.
ll y a des bouleversements, ici.
Alors, partez.
Mon travail n'est pas terminé.
Tant que vous serez en danger,
- toi et...
- Jacob.
On n'oublie pas son frère.
Ni dans la vie,
ni dans la mort.
Vous êtes silencieux...
Ca ne vous change pas.
Amusant.
Je vous attendais.
Votre frère m'a chargé
de vous donner ça.
L'inspecteur Keyes
est venue vous voir.
Vous savez qui c'est.
Elle aide Fernando
à retrouver son frère.
Elle m'a donné ça pour vous.
C'est un ordre d'exhumer
pour une certaine Hall.
Marisa Hall.
C'est fort intéressant.
L'inspecteur Keyes
est passée au labo
prendre les empreintes digitales
de cadavres.
ll y a un corps prédisséqué
sur ma table. Je parie
qu'il s'agit de Marisa Hall.
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Combien de vos clients
l'inspecteur Keyes
va trouver dans mon labo ?
Et pourquoi Enrique Ramos
a été enterré vivant
dans la tombe qu'il creusait ?
Je l'ai déterré moi-même.
Si vous ne voulez pas creuser
votre tombe,
dites-moi ce qu'il faisait là-bas.
ll y a un an, mon frère
m'a demandé d'incinérer un SDF.
Enrique travaillait tard.
En voyant le corps,
il s'est énervé
et a appelé mon frère.
Ensuite, mon frère
le cherchait partout.
Je lui ai dit qu'Enrique
enterrait Marisa Hall.
Je pensais
qu'il l'avait fait partir.
ll n'a pas eu cette chance.
lncroyable ! lls ont augmenté
le prix des chips.
C'est mon travail de nettoyer.
Je m'appelle Brigitte.
Vous avez perdu votre langue ?
C'est juste que je pensais...
être le seul à manger
ces trucs-là.
Vous n'êtes plus seul, M. Broots.
Au fait,
M. Raines n'est pas
dans son bureau.
Je ne devrais pas faire ça.
Le Dr Fein
ferme son labo à clé.
ll a peur
qu'on lui pique ses données.
Même les cobayes
entraient un par un.
Comme ce SDF ?
Broadstreet Bill ?
Le Dr Fein
a fait des tests sur lui.
Et on l'a pas vu
depuis un an ?
Personne ne le verra plus jamais.
Raines n'avait rien sur M. Lyle.
Comme s'il n'existait pas.
Pourquoi vous faites
dans votre froc ?
Pourquoi ?
A cause de cette Brigitte.
On dit que c'est une tueuse.
Elle m'a vu sortir de chez Raines.
Elle m'a appelé ''monsieur''.
Elle voulait dire quoi ?
Oubliez la sorcière
et démarrez ce foutu disque.
ll vient des archives privées
de Raines.
C'est Jarod !
Vous étiez en Europe.
R.A.S. On s'en va.
Et là ?
Aucune idée.
Je ne suis jamais entré.
On ne devrait pas faire ça.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
Qui est avec M. Raines ?
Cardio-benzine.
Ca ralentit le rythme cardiaque.
A dose suffisamment élevée,
Ca l'arrête.
Zoomez sur la jauge.
Mon Dieu.
Niveau de congélation.
Là. Arrêtez.
Qui est-ce ?
M. Lyle.
Ce monstre est partout.
Qui est-ce ?
J'en sais rien.
C'est ce qui me fait peur.
Adrénaline cortisone.
Le remède expérimental
pour la tension ?
Expérimental, oui.
Pour la tension, non.
ll s'en servait pour réanimer.
Ca lui servait à quoi ?
A rattraper ses bourdes.
Jarod fibrille.
lls le tuaient.
Dégagez !
C'est ce qu'ils m'ont fait.
M. Fein voulait tuer
ses cobayes ?
ll les tuait tous.
Pour une minute ou deux.
Puis, il les ressuscitait.
Broadstreet Bill ?
Celui qui n'est pas revenu.
Blague ou bonbon ?
Qui veut des Pez ?
- Blague ou bonbon ?
- Tenez.
Dr Fein ? Jarod à l'appareil.
Navré de vous déranger,
mais Sheldon vous cherche.
A propos d'un ordre d'exhumer.
D'exhumer ?
ll a dit de qui il s'agit ?
Une certaine Hall.
Vous voulez que j'y aille ?
Une erreur
nuirait à la réputation
de l'école.
Non, je m'en occupe.
Comme vous voulez.
Blague ou bonbon ?
Quelle peur !
Après tout, c'est bien là
le sens de cette fête.
N'est-ce pas ?
Vous arrivez trop tard.
ll est parti.
- Qui ça ?
- Enrique.
Le garçon que vous avez tué.
- Quelle macabre plaisanterie...
- Ce n'est pas une plaisanterie.
C'est une leçon de vie.
Dans certaines cultures,
l'esprit d'un homme tué violemment
revient se venger de son assassin.
Flippant, non ?
- Je m'en vais.
- Ne partez pas, Dr Fein.
C'est le jour des morts
et vous êtes
l'invité d'honneur.
Laissez-moi sortir.
Ce n'est pas drôle !
Je sais, ce serait affreux
d'être enterré vivant.
Surtout avec ça au pied.
Ne réveillez pas les morts.
Vous les rejoindrez bientôt.
Enrique avait découvert
que vous aviez tué un cobaye ?
Vous êtes fou !
On ne dit pas ça
à un homme muni d'une pelle.
Laissez-moi sortir !
Vous avez transformé un SDF
en cobaye humain
pour tester vos médicaments.
En cas d'échec,
personne ne le réclamerait.
Ce fut un échec.
Et quelqu'un l'a réclamé :
Enrique.
Vous l'avez enterré vivant
pour protéger vos recherches.
N'est-ce pas ?
Oui ! Laissez-moi sortir !
En criant,
vous gaspillez de l'oxygène.
Et croyez-moi,
vous allez en avoir besoin !
Joyeux Halloween !
Attends 1 5 mn
et appelle l'inspecteur Keyes.
ll a assez d'air ?
Plus qu'assez,
mais il n'a pas à le savoir.
Vous savez, le Bosniaque ?
C'est le meilleur Halloween
de ma vie.
- 9/20 ?
- J'ai pas eu 9/20.
Mais si !
- C'est toi qui as eu 9/20.
- Mauvais !
Vous attendiez
Florence Nightingale ?
Que voulez-vous ?
Des réponses.
Que vous seul
pouvez me donner.
Votre peau cicatrise bien.
Evitons une autre explosion.
Personne
ne nous entendra.
Personne ne nous voit.
Et personne ne viendra
vous sauver.
ll n'y a que vous...
et moi.
Maintenant...
je veux savoir où est mon père.
Où...
est...
mon père ?
Je ne sais pas.
- ll est mort ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Qui est M. Lyle ?
Qui est-il ?
C'est le père fouettard.
lls ont arrêté mon coeur.
- Pourquoi ?
- J'en sais rien.
Pourquoi M. Raines
fait-il ce qu'il fait ?
ll n'était pas seul.
L'autre homme...
M. Lyle.
ll est au Centre, maintenant.
Je ne laisserai pas passer ça.
Je te le promets.
Moi non plus.
Ca va aller ?
Je survivrai.
Même si c'est le jour des morts.
Halloween.
Je suis en retard
pour la tournée des bonbons.
Déguisé en quoi ?
La pire créature
que je connaisse.
Blague ou bonbon ?

Vu dans Le Caméléon :
Un problème au Centre ?
Mon père est à son bureau
à 7 h depuis 35 ans.
Depuis 15jours, personne.
Dieu merci, tu es revenu, papa.
Qui êtes-vous ?
M. Lyle.
Brigitte, la nouvelle nettoyeuse.
Nous avons cru bon que Brigitte
vous aide à capturer Jarod.
ll aboie des ordres
et les huiles obéissent.
ll estpeut-être du Triumvirat.
lls viendraient faire quoi ?
Prendre le pouvoir.
Leur apparition expliquerait
la disparition de votre père.
Pourquoi le faire disparaître ?
Parce qu'on a tiré sur Raines.
lls ne renoncerontpas
à savoir qui.
Qui est M. Lyle ?
C'est le père fouettard.
L'argent a été viré
sur notre compte d'Omaha
et prélevé électroniquement.
On vérifie les mouvements.
On espère que c'est une erreur.
Jarod a volé 1 5 millions de dollars
au Centre
pour une oeuvre de charité.
Sa seule erreur :
nous mettre le nez dedans.
''Votre généreuse donation
''aidera l'organisation à l'avenir.
''Les millions de dollars
'feront le bonheur des enfants.
''Prions pour vous.
Bonne journée.''
Je l'aurai.
Je vous en prie.
Jarod est plus dangereux
que je pensais.
J'aime la glace.
- Tenez, Jarod.
- Merci, Phil.
- Très intéressant.
- C'est une Roue magique.
Ca sert à quoi ?
A rien.
Ca n'arrête jamais de tourner.
Ca tourne en rond.
Tu me la vends pour 1 0 $ ?
Désolée.
1 5 ?
Non. C'est un cadeau
de mon grand-père.
20 ?
- 25.
- Vendu !
Salut, bonhomme.
Va te chercher à manger.
Je t'installe.
Je reviens.
Ca roule, Scooter ?
Vous devriez pas venir.
Où trouver une glace ailleurs ?
Quel temps !
ll fait au moins 40l à l'ombre.
T'as bonne mine, Scott.
Tu veux quoi, Nick ?
ll s'agit pas de ce que je veux,
mais de ce dont j'ai besoin : toi.
Non.
Pas cette fois.
C'est une super occase.
Ta dernière occase
m'a coûté 7 ans de ma vie.
Je suis sorti de taule
depuis 1 0 mois.
J'ai mon fils.
Ca m'intéresse pas.
lntéresse-toi.
Papa ?
Attends-moi devant.
J'arrive.
Sean, obéis à ton père.
Va-t'en.
Je vois ton dilemme.
Un coup et on est quittes.
Prends Martinez.
ll est mort.
ll avait dit non.
L'équipe ?
Nous trois, plus un.
C'est pas risqué ?
Trinney envoie
un mec de Brooklyn.
Un certain M.D. Cross.
Cross ? Connais pas.
Moi non plus.
Trinney en répond.
ll est manchot.
Un casseur manchot ?
Je le prends à 1 5 h à la gare.
On commence ce soir.
Scotty ? Sois pas en retard.
C'était rien.
Des types qui m'embêtent.
Tout va bien.
A la gare.
- Vous partez ?
- Rendez-vous d'affaires.
Vous faites quoi ?
Je suis un casseur manchot.
Quel bras ?
Bonne question !
Jarod mijote quelque chose.
Je sens ça comme la grippe.
Après avoir frôlé la mort,
il profite peut-être de la vie.
ll est peut-être en vacances.
Vous avez mangé un oignon ?
Tu m'as raté à Omaha.
ll s'est passé quoi, à Omaha ?
Le Centre t'a mise à l'écart.
lls ont envoyé une remplaçante.
De quoi tu parles ?
De la blonde.
1,70 m. 55 kg.
Desjambes à tomber.
Tu renonces à moi ?
Tu rêves !
Le train en provenance
de Brooklyn entre en gare.
C'est mon train.
J'y vais.
De quoi il parlait ?
J'aimerais le savoir.
M.D. Main Droite.
Très drôle.
Vous retournez pas.
On nous épie.
Des flics ?
Ecoutez.
Je le répéterai pas.
Le lieu a changé.
Le coup est à lndianapolis.
Je suis de Flatbush.
L'lowa, connais pas.
L'lndiana.
C'est kif-kif.
J'ai noté l'adresse,
les codes et tout.
C'est pas casher.
J'appelle Trinney.
Si vous faites ça,
vous perdez ceci.
Vous en aurez autant
après le coup.
- La cible ?
- Je m'en occupe.
Rendez-vous dans 4 jours
à l'hôtel Argyle de New York.
J'ai réservé une chambre.
Je peux partir avec le magot.
Si vous faites ça,
je vous poursuis comme Martinez.
On vous appellera ''Sans Main''.
Dur !
Le train pour l'lndiana
va partir...
C'est le vôtre.
Laissez ça sur place.
C'est quoi ?
Une carte illustrée.
J'envoie toujours mes voeux.
Laissez ça.
C'est mes outils.
Achetez-en d'autres.
Y a un flic qui cherche
un manchot
portant une mallette noire.
Je prends la mallette...
et le risque.
Comment vous ferez ?
Rendez-vous à New York.
Rendez-vous à New York.
M. Cross ?
Appelez-moi M.D.
Pourquoi j'ai rien su d'Omaha ?
Changez ces masques de place.
Sauf votre respect,
je n'ai pas
à vous informer
des mouvements de Jarod.
A vous de m'informer.
- D'après votre dossier...
- Pardon ?
D'après votre dossier,
vous teniez Jarod
à Las Vegas, Chicago,
washington et en Floride.
Vous avez eu l'occasion
de le ramener.
Je vais vous le faire manger,
mon dossier.
Ne soyez pas susceptible,
Mlle Parker.
Vous emménagez ?
Posséder n'est pas tout.
Excusez-nous,
nous avons une réunion.
Du nouveau
sur votre père disparu ?
Qui dit qu'il l'est ?
ll plie bagage et disparaîît.
C'est logique.
Vous l'avez offert à votre père
quand vous étiez petite.
Je pensais qu'il l'avait jeté.
Je suis sûr qu'il va bien.
ll ne partirait pas
sans dire au revoir.
N'est-ce pas ?
Vous êtes mort.
Et on a tous les menottes.
Vingt minutes.
C'est tout ce qu'on a
avant la ronde du gardien.
ll faut faire plus vite
avec la 2e alarme.
Je fais de mon mieux.
Dans le temps,
tu faisais ça en dormant.
Tu te souviens, Dewey ?
Scooter était le meilleur.
A 1 6 ans, il ouvrait
les coffres de la YMCA
et volait portefeuilles
et caleçons.
Tu faisais quoi
de ces caleçons ?
C'était il y a longtemps.
Je t'ai sorti de la rue.
Je t'ai traité
comme mon fils.
Et quand ça a chauffé,
tu m'as laissé prendre
Laissons-le.
Ce coup est assez dur comme ça.
J'ai pas besoin
d'un mec distrait.
Je le connais.
Vous, en revanche,
êtes un mystère.
J'appelle Trinney
pour vous remplacer ?
On réessaie.
La nuit a été longue.
On reprend demain chez moi.
Vous avez un stylo ?
Pour l'adresse.
81 6, Highland.
''A papa, de la part de Sean.''
C'est votre fils ?
Ma vie.
Un cadeau de fête des pères.
Viens, Jarod.
Mlle Parker
a fait un cadeau à cet homme.
Pourquoi ?
C'est la fête des pères.
C'estpour lui dire
qu'elle l'aime.
Je passe ça sur lnternet ?
Oui. Je veux savoir
d'où il sort.
Je parie ma retraite
qu'il est recherché.
Le point d'interrogation,
c'est les vigiles.
Je pensais pas m'en servir.
Pour ouvrir les portes fermées ?
On sait pas
sur qui on tombe.
Parfois,
il suffit d'avoir l'air dangereux.
Sean, qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
J'habite ici.
T'es censé être
chez Mme Albertson.
Je suis passé à la boutique.
Tu n'y étais pas.
C'est ma faute.
J'ai insisté pour voir
les meubles de ton père.
Je m'appelle Cross,
M.D. Cross.
M.D. comme Main Droite.
C'est quoi, ça ?
T'occupe pas.
Si le juge d'application
des peines te voit,
tu auras des ennuis.
Je veux pas.
Qui est le père ici ?
Retourne chez Mme Albertson,
je viendrai te chercher.
Fais ce que je dis !
Attends... Sean !
Ecoute.
J'ai besoin d'être
un peu tranquille.
Je t'aime.
Moi aussi, je t'aime.
A plus, Main Droite.
Enchanté, Sean.
Pourquoi vous faites ça ?
Ce coup,
vous voulez pas le faire.
Donc, Avani
vous fait du chantage.
J'ai pas connu mes parents.
La mère de Sean est morte
après sa naissance
et je suis parti en taule.
Sean est passé
de famille en famille,
comme moi.
Vous l'avez retrouvé.
Et je compte le garder.
Un fils a besoin de son père.
Tu dois finir
la dernière simulation.
J'ai fait ça pour vous.
Pour moi ?
Ca vous plaît ?
Non, Jarod.
Ne recommence
plusjamais.
Au travail.
Bonne fête, papa
On a reçu ça
du bureau d'lndianapolis.
M.D. Cross.
ll casse des coffres-forts.
En quoi ça nous intéresse ?
D'après le bureau,
Cross a pris 25 000 $.
Et il a laissé ça.
D'après le cahier rouge,
Cross retrouve Jarod
à l'hôtel Argyle
de New York.
Jarod n'aurait pas
laissé ça.
Cross a foiré et oublié ça.
C'est tiré par les cheveux.
D'après les gardes
d'lndianapolis,
Cross a failli être pris.
Brigitte, allez à New York.
Trouvez Cross.
Je ne comprends pas.
C'est un message de Jarod
pour vous deux.
Lequel ?
Vous tournez en rond.
On a 1 8 mn
avant la ronde du gardien.
J'aime pas ça.
Un fourgon nous suivait.
Les flics savent.
Alors, ils suivent encore Dewey.
J'ai tout prévu.
On y va.
- Combien de temps ?
- 5 mn.
Vous en avez 3.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
ll est en avance.
Toutes les 20 mn ?
- C'est quoi ?
- Le gardien.
Encore longtemps ?
Deux minutes.
Tu vas faire quoi ?
Réduire les risques.
J'y suis.
On a volé une carte magnétique ?
Elle ouvre le dépôt
de diamants à wilmington.
De quoi tu causes ?
ll dit qu'il y a pas de fric.
ll y a un autre coup.
C'est bien ça ?
20 millions de dollars
de diamants.
D'après ma source,
ils resteront 36 h au dépôt.
On y va lundi avant l'ouverture
et avant qu'on remarque
l'absence de la carte.
On avait dit un coup.
Sans moi.
Ca me désole, Scott.
J'espère que tu changeras d'avis.
On a beau prévoir...
A demain.
Dewey ?
C'est Nick.
Ca va ?
Oui, ça va.
Ce genre de truc arrive,
avec Avani.
Un problème ?
C'est trop facile.
- Quoi ?
- Ca !
Nick me laisserait pas
partir comme ça.
A moins que...
Vous avez une voiture ?
Oui, venez.
Sean ?
Sean, réponds-moi !
La maison est vide.
Désolé, Scotty.
L'occasion est trop belle.
J'ai besoin de toi.
Sean est en sûreté.
Ca dépend de toi
qu'il le reste.
lntelli-Research l'a trouvé
sur le réseau de la police.
Pourquoi Jarod serait
fiché par la police ?
D'après les données,
il est soupçonné
d'appartenir à un gang
de cambrioleurs par ici.
Pardon ?
L'avis a été envoyé
par l'inspecteur Evans
de Middletown.
C'est à moins de 1 50 km d'ici.
Reste à savoir
ce que Jarod fabrique
avec des cambrioleurs.
C'est une équipe de haut vol.
Spécialiste des coups impossibles.
Comme ?
Convois de fonds, chambres fortes.
Surtout des diamants.
Recherchez les cibles potentielles
dans un rayon de 600 km.
Tout ce qui peut les intéresser.
Fouillez le passé
de l'inspecteur Evans.
S'il a volé un Nuts à 6 ans,
je veux savoir
combien il avait de cacahuètes.
J'ai étudié le plan
de la salle de bal.
On a intérêt à faire sauter
les portes de derrière.
Ca me paraîît juste.
T'en penses quoi, Scotty ?
Rendez-le-moi.
Je suis là.
C'est ce que tu voulais.
Rends-moi mon fils.
Concentre-toi.
Pour le bien du petit.
Ce n'est qu'un blindage d'acier...
Où est mon fils ?
Si tu tires, tu tues Sean.
Scotty, laissez-le.
Où est Sean ?
Après ce coup,
vous serez avec Sean.
Promis.
Donnez-moi ça.
Donnez-moi ce flingue.
S'il lui arrive malheur,
tu regretteras d'être en vie.
Ne jamais sous-estimer
la relation père/fils.
Je ne peuxpas l'accepter.
C'estpour vous.
Je ne suis pas ton père.
C'est destiné
à quelqu'un d'autre.
Vous ne m'aimez pas ?
On a du travail.
Ca sent le gin, ici.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Je n'ai ni le temps
ni l'envie de bavarder.
J'irai donc droit au but.
Vous avez un nom ?
Disons seulement
que j'ai votre misérable vie
entre les mains.
Vraiment ?
A vous de juger.
Allez-y, ouvrez.
D'où vous tenez ça ?
Aucune importance.
En revanche,
j'en ai plusieurs copies.
Bien...
Vous avez diffusé cette photo ?
Je le veux.
Je sais rien.
Je le veux.
Harold ?
Désolée...
Pour vous et pour moi.
Je sais peut-être
où ils vont frapper.
Soulagez votre prostate,
je tiens Jarod.
La blondasse
va faire craquer son string...
Je vous en prie, continuez.
Pendant que vous y êtes,
expliquez-moi ça.
J'ai vu M.D. Cross
à New York.
On l'a envoyé braquer
notre bureau d'lndiana.
Un homme du type de Jarod.
On a essayé de vous prévenir.
M. Evans va bien ?
Vous m'avez filée ?
En effet.
Dites-moi tout ce que vous savez.
Jarod est lié
à des cambrioleurs.
D'après Evans, ils visent le dépôt
de diamants de wilmington.
On les encercle
et on les coince tous.
Je suis contre.
- Quelle surprise !
- Vous avez mieux ?
Vous l'avez déjà encerclé.
Jarod ne se laissera pas
prendre dehors.
On le laisse entrer
dans le coffre,
quand il se sent en sûreté,
on le cueille.
Autant lui poster les diamants.
Je connais Jarod.
Je sais comment il pense.
Mais il vous échappe.
On suit le plan de Brigitte.
M. Broots, je vous charge
du système de sécurité du dépôt.
Vous pouvez ?
Allez sur place
et verrouillez le bâtiment.
Ca ne marchera pas.
Nous allons attraper Jarod
une fois pour toutes.
Vous pouvez ?
Dewey a pris ces photos
du dépôt.
La carte désactive
le 1 er système de sécurité.
- Du monde sur place ?
- Minime.
Le dernier système
est à infrarouges.
Tu peux le franchir ?
Bien sûr.
Alors, pas de problème ?
Pas maintenant.
Vous disiez ?
Rien.
Vous avez l'air secoué.
Non, ça va.
On est fin prêts ?
Accès restreint
Entrez mot de passe
Les zones coloriées
représentent les accès au dépôt.
Quand c'est rouge,
le bâtiment est verrouillé.
Quand c'est vert,
il ne l'est pas.
A mon avis, ils désactiveront
la vidéo-surveillance
dès leur entrée.
Mais peu importe.
Moi seul ai le mot de passe
pour contrôler le système.
Très impressionnant.
Je suis sûr
que M. Broots a tout prévu.
Vous êtes sûr, M. Broots ?
C'est parti.
On y est.
lls sont dedans.
Finissons-en.
Pas encore.
ll est à notre merci.
Et savoir cela
nous donne l'avantage.
Celui de la surprise.
Mais encore ?
Nous le tenons, M. Lyle.
Ne faisons pas d'erreur.
Vous faites quoi ?
Ou je vous explique,
ou je le fais
et on s'en va.
A vous de voir.
Jarod ne serait pas entré là
sans plan de sortie.
On fait comme prévu.
Tournez-vous les pouces.
Moi, je vais faire mon boulot.
Vous ne saboterez pas l'opération.
Vous allez tirer ?
C'est fait.
La mèche a cédé.
- Vous en avez une autre ?
- Dans mon sac.
J'y vais.
Je sais où elle est.
- Retirez le bout cassé.
- Faites vite.
Scotty, aidez-moi.
- Une seconde.
- Maintenant.
Ouvrez-moi.
Rendez-lui son fils.
Ouvrez !
Vous ne comprenez pas ?
Libérez Sean.
Dewey le tient.
Appelez-le
et dites-lui de le relâcher.
Ouvrez ou je tire.
Allez-y.
Dis-lui.
Nick, arrête.
Pan !
Parfois,
avoir l'air dangereux...
ça suffit pas.
Appelez-le.
Le numéro.
C'est Nick.
Libère le gosse.
Tout de suite !
Le téléphone.
ll fallait appeler Trinney.
Scotty, sors-moi de là.
Tous les soirs, pendant 7 ans,
j'ai pensé à toi.
Et en sortant...
j'ai enfin une vie
et tu me prends mon fils.
C'était professionnel.
Ca, c'est personnel.
On se casse.
Me laissez pas ici !
Deux sortent.
Mon arme.
Si vous voulez Jarod,
donnez-moi mon arme.
Envoyez les nettoyeurs.
Tous les accès
se déverrouillent.
ll reste une zone bouclée.
Sean ?
J'ai eu si peur !
Ca va ?
Ca va.
Tu vas bien ?
N'en fais pas un plat.
Navré de vous interrompre.
Vous devriez mettre les bouts.
Prenez ça avec vous.
C'est de l'argent qu'on me devait.
Je ne comprends pas.
Considérez ça comme un cadeau
de fête des pères.
Bonne chance.
Bonne chance.
Un gang de cambrioleurs
pris en flagrant délit
Ca n'a pas été trop dur,
dans le dépôt ?
Non. Tu as impressionné
le nouveau régime.
J'espère que
ça ne te causera pas d'ennuis.
Votre inquiétude me touche.
Mais je n'appelle pas pour ça.
Je me demandais
si vous aviez jamais imaginé
ce que ce serait d'être mon père.
Ca ne s'est jamais présenté.
Je ne me suis jamais autorisé
à entretenir cette idée.
Merci, Sydney.
Ca a le mérite d'être franc.

Tout ce qui est louche ici
est signé
M. Lambeaux de peau.
- Ca a changé depuis...
- Qu'on a tiré sur Raines.
- Je ne suis pas tireur d'élite.
- Je voulais pas d'arme.
Sij'avais tiré sur le tubard,
il serait mort,
pas au pavillon
des grands brûlés.
Le Centre t'a mise à l'écart.
lls ont envoyé
une remplaçante.
- De quoi parles-tu ?
- De la blonde.
Du nouveau
sur votre père disparu ?
Qui dit qu'il l'est ?
Rentre à la maison, Jarod.
Prends ma main.
Je ne peuxpas.
Essaie.
Tu peuxy arriver.
Maman !
Ne t'en va pas.
Ne t'en va pas.
Jarod passait son temps ici
pendant son séjour.
Dans un tipi ?
Non, c'est un caisson
d'isolation sensorielle.
Je m'étonne
qu'il s'en soit approché.
Jarod adorait
flotter dans le caisson.
Ca lui donnait la liberté
dont il avait besoin.
En général, on reste une heure.
Jarod y passait
des jours.
En sortant,
il embrassait tout le monde.
Jamais je n'ai connu
un tel lien avec l'autre.
Prenez une douche
et ça pourrait vous arriver.
Jarod a laissé quelque chose ?
ll m'a dit de vous donner ça.
Merci.
J'ai une arme et je m'en sers.
Super !
Retrouvons-le.
Vivre dans un tipi !
Au secours !
Au secours !
Tenez bon.
Jarod, attendez la nacelle !
Sa corde ne tiendra pas.
Appelez l'hélico !
Tenez bon.
De la corde !
Ca va pas ?
Attendez !
Tenez bon.
Je vous tiens.
Belle journée pour être en vie !
La victime va s'en tirer.
Formidable !
Paraîît que vous avez risqué gros.
ll fallait le voir !
Direct dans la légende !
Attention, Spiderman est parmi nous.
On verra qui tisse la toile.
- Spiderman ?
- La bande dessinée.
Des brochures immobilières de Denver.
Une mutation ?
La retraite.
Mon petit-fils vit à Denver.
C'est une bonne chose !
Ca fait de la promo pour les autres.
Préparez-vous, on va à la tour.
Bon sang !
3 fois en une semaine.
Avec Bobby,
on s'entraîînera 24 h sur 24.
Bien vu.
On s'y met tous.
- Comme d'habitude.
- C'est un rite.
A chaque mission réussie,
5 $ pour Chris.
- Tombé à l'entraîînement ?
- ll est sorti du coma.
L'assurance
ne couvre pas les accidents ?
Si.
Mais Chris a essayé de se tuer.
Où étiez-vous passés ?
Dans notre petit coin de paradis.
Je vous ai rapporté ça.
Vous n'allez pas y croire !
J'ai l'habitude.
Et mon père ?
Personne ne sait où il est.
La fayote doit le savoir.
N'accusez pas
sans preuves.
Un bon conseil :
Avec M. Lyle et elle,
c'est devenu bizarre.
Ca va l'être encore plus.
Le voilà.
C'est lui.
lls viennent par ici !
Voici le Dr Curtis.
ll travaille pour M. Lyle et moi.
Enchanté.
Je n'en doute pas.
S'il veut vous parler,
merci d'être disponibles.
Certainement.
Merci ! On y va ?
- Qui est-ce ?
- Je voulais vous le dire.
C'est un criminologue behavioriste.
ll doit trouver
qui a tiré sur Raines.
C'est très mauvais signe.
Du calme, Broots.
lls cherchent un tireur,
pas un chialeur.
lls vont accuser quelqu'un.
Et avec eux,
on est des cibles sur pattes.
Un innocent n'a rien à craindre.
On est au Centre.
J'ai une petite fille
qui aime son papa.
On ignore
s'il voudra nous parler.
Ben voyons !
M. Raines forcera tous les témoins
à parler à ce type.
Je dis bien tous.
D'enfer !
Les victimes ont le temps
de voir un film !
Deux minutes !
2'07. Pas mal.
C'est trop,
pour une manoeuvre simple.
Moins fort !
J'essaie de réfléchir !
On a réveillé le monstre.
Qui est-ce ?
ll se fait appeler Spencer.
ll se plaint du bruit
et écrit des poèmes.
Et il cherche à les vendre !
- Chris a voulu se tuer ici ?
- Roger l'a trouvé là.
Je pensais
qu'on pouvait tout se dire.
Chris était déprimé
mais ne parlait pas de suicide.
Rien n'est sûr.
ll a laissé un mot
sur son ordinateur.
J'ai vu ça à Chicago.
Un type déprimé par son boulot.
La pression.
Non, Chris adorait son boulot.
C'était peut-être sa famille.
Sa mère l'a abandonné très jeune.
Depuis la mort de son père,
il la cherche.
ll ne l'a pas trouvée ?
ll la croyait tout près.
ll a passé des annonces
dans le journal, sur lnternet.
ll devait penser
ne jamais la trouver,
toujours ressentir ce vide.
C'est fou
de ne pas connaîître sa mère !
Un sauveteur tente de se suicider
Maman, appelle-moi
Grace Welman, où es-tu ?
Chris, calmez-vous !
Du calme !
Je vous en prie !
Désolée.
Pas de visites maintenant.
Calmez-vous.
- Revenez plus tard.
- La sortie du coma
provoque un choc.
ll a peur.
ll a besoin de contact, d'amour.
Vous êtes psy ?
Je sais ce qu'est l'isolement.
Venez, Jo Ellen.
Embrassez-le.
C'est toujours votre ami.
Tout va bien.
Soyons clairs,
je veux bien comprendre.
C'est une araignée et un homme ?
C'est un lycéen piqué
par une araignée radioactive.
Ca doit faire mal.
ll développe
des pouvoirs d'araignée.
ll escalade, lance des toiles
et a une sensibilité d'araignée.
C'est-à-dire ?
Je ne sais pas.
ll a la tête qui vibre...
J'ignorais que c'était
le cas des arachnides.
Les arachnides, je sais pas,
mais lui, oui !
C'est fascinant.
Je vais tous les lire.
Mme welman ?
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Je suis un ami de Chris.
Vous faites erreur.
Je m'appelle Carter.
C'est votre nom de jeune fille.
- Que voulez-vous ?
- Ce qui compte,
c'est ce que veut Chris.
ll vous cherche.
ll a besoin de vous.
Je n'ai rien demandé.
Et surtout pas qu'on me trouve.
Maman, je t'aime.
Ne me quitte pas !
Ne t'en va pas.
Votre mère vous prenait
dans ses bras ?
Tu dois entrer dans le caisson.
Qu'éprouve-t-on
dans les bras de sa mère ?
C'est comment ?
Là n'estpas la question.
Le caisson détend
et aide à se concentrer.
Je veux savoir ce que ça fait.
J'ai oublié comment c'est.
Jarod, écoute-moi.
Tu ne connaîtrasjamais
cette expérience.
Ta mère est...
Mieux vaudrait
que tu l'oublies.
Jamaisje ne l'oublierai.
Penser à ta famille
perturbe ton travail.
Trouver ma famille,
c'est mon travail, Sydney.
On cherche à savoir qui a pu
tirer sur M. Raines.
Je suis là pour aider.
Je sais
que votre situation est délicate.
Nous perdons notre temps.
Vous n'êtes pas marié, hein ?
Je dois répondre
à des questions rhétoriques ?
Qu'éprouvez-vous pour Jarod ?
A vous de me le dire.
Très bien.
C'est le fils
que vous n'avez jamais eu.
Quels sont vos sentiments
pour lui ?
Vous vous débrouillez bien,
continuez.
Vous aimez beaucoup Jarod.
Vous feriez tout pour le protéger.
Mais par curiosité, entre nous...
Comment assumez-vous
le fait de l'avoir enlevé
à sa famille ?
Je n'ai pas été mêlé
à son enlèvement.
Vous n'avez rien fait contre.
Ca ne vous a rien fait ?
Aucun remords
de l'avoir privé d'une vie normale ?
Je n'avais pas le choix.
Vraiment ?
J'ai dû obéir.
A qui ?
La personne à qui vous obéissez.
Exactement.
On sait donc
que vous tenez M. Raines
pour responsable
du gâchis de la vie de Jarod.
On sait aussi que tuer Raines
vous procurerait
une profonde satisfaction.
C'est humain.
J'exècre la violence.
Ca ne signifie pas,
vu la motivation,
que vous n'iriez pas
jusque-là.
Ce sera tout, docteur.
Un peu d'entrain !
C'est divertissant.
Drôle. Vous comprenez ?
Ce Spiderman
est un super-héros fascinant.
Cependant,
sa vie est très triste.
ll est orphelin,
se reproche la mort de son oncle
et on essaie de le tuer.
La malédiction du super-héros !
Peter Parker
n'avait aucun problème.
Contrairement à Miss Hulk.
Vous voilà !
Vos résultats.
Le condamné marche vite
vers la potence.
On va devoir s'entraîîner.
Jarod, vous serez avec Roger
samedi matin. Jo Ellen
et Bobby, l'après-midi.
Je peux changer ?
J'ai des projets.
Annulez.
Bobby est rapide à la corde.
- Pas vous.
- Tu dormiras le matin
et tu seras plus belle.
Si c'est possible.
S'il vous plaîît !
C'est non.
On a du pain sur la planche.
A plus tard.
Que tient Chris ?
Un tendeur.
C'est bon pour ses muscles.
Astucieux.
Un élastique avec des crochets.
C'est le concept.
ll va se rétablir ?
C'est tôt,
mais je suis optimiste
quant à ses facultés
cognitives et motrices.
ll a pu parler de sa chute ?
Son amnésie traumatique
est en progrès,
mais aucun souvenir
de l'accident.
Le lobe frontal a dû être touché.
ll n'a pas encodé l'incident
dans sa mémoire.
Vous ne connaissez pas
les tendeurs
et vous connaissez
la théorie de Dearling ?
J'ai travaillé au noir
comme psychologue.
J'ai lu son dossier.
Chris est tombé sur le dos.
En effet.
L'hématome de la 1 2e vertèbre
indique
qu'il est tombé
sur quelque chose.
Le rapport n'en parle pas.
Ses blessures
devraient être plus graves.
Une chute de quatre étages
est souvent fatale.
Vous avez aussi été chirurgien ?
Avant de faire du rodéo.
Ce bruit
réveillerait un mort.
Désolé, je suis tombé.
J'aimerais vous parler.
Vous n'avez rien de mieux
à faire à 3 h du matin ?
ll est 7 h.
Les nuisances sonores
empirent chaque jour.
Si le bruit vous gêne autant,
vivez dans un abri !
Un poète a besoin de liberté
pour créer.
Ca... c'est la liberté.
Le seul inconvénient,
c'est le bruit.
Vous écriviez,
le jour où cet homme est tombé ?
Je cherchais une rime
et j'ai entendu
quelqu'un crier : ''Non !''
Un peu comme vous
tout à l'heure.
Et puis, boum !
Après, ça a été la pagaille.
Sirènes, ambulances, flics.
Je n'ai plus pu créer
de la journée.
Selon le rapport, vous n'avez pas
parlé à la police.
J'ai seulement parlé
à un des sauveteurs.
- Qui ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Ce type est arrivé,
s'est excusé pour le bruit.
ll m'a donné 20 $
pour acheter à manger.
Ca, c'était poétique.
ll était comment ?
Avec l'équipement et le casque,
vous vous ressemblez tous.
Vous savez quoi ?
ll avait une pince à billets
particulière.
Avec une sorte
de toile d'araignée
au milieu.
Des pastèques ?
On appelle ça comme ça
sur terre. Le dessert de ce soir.
Pourquoi taper dessus ?
Je donne des coups.
Sinon,
comment savoir si elle est mûre ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je n'en ai jamais mangé.
C'est un régal, E.T.
Chacun paie sa part.
Vous me devez 5 $.
Je n'ai rien sur moi.
Tout le monde doit payer.
Maman t'a pas donné
d'argent de poche ?
Si on veut.
Vous me dépannez ?
- Vous me rembourserez ?
- Bien sûr.
On peut se faire confiance
entre nous, non ?
ll paraîît que...
Entrez.
Asseyez-vous.
Elles sont mignonnes !
J'ai étudié votre dossier.
J'ai une lettre
d'une certaine
Mme Mosely.
Quoi ? Mon institutrice ?
- Ca remonte à quand ?
- C'est adressé à votre mère.
Mme Mosely semblait s'inquiéter
pour votre sécurité à l'école.
Pourquoi ?
On s'en prenait
à l'intello de service.
Vous vous rappelez
ce que vous éprouviez ?
Je suppose. Si j'y réfléchis.
A toi.
Avez-vous jamais essayé
de vous défendre
contre vos persécuteurs ?
Quels persécuteurs ?
En fait, non. J'ai appris
à être plus malin qu'eux.
Et aujourd'hui ?
Comment réagissez-vous ?
- Personne ne me persécute.
- Je pensais
que Mlle Parker le faisait.
Elle me taquine amicalement.
Vous êtes donc amis !
Non, attendez un peu.
Pas tout à fait.
Comment vous traite M. Raines ?
ll me traite bien.
Avec un grand respect.
C'est très intéressant.
Je vois qu'on vous a souvent
entendu le critiquer.
C'est un pur mensonge.
J'aimerais savoir qui a dit ça !
ll s'agit... de M. Raines.
Ca doit vous ronger,
de vous sentir persécuté
et de devoir toujours encaisser.
Sans jamais pouvoir vous venger.
Combien de temps accepterez-vous
d'être humilié avant de dire
''Assez ! C'est terminé !'' ?
- Jusqu'où irez-vous ?
- Vous voulez entrer dans ma tête.
Remuer tout ça.
Raté !
A toi.
Je veux pas !
Laissez-la !
Que lui fera-t-on ?
A votre avis ?
On va lui faire mal ?
Comme M. Raines
avec votre fille ?
Dites la vérité !
Si quelqu'un touche à ma fille,
je le tue !
Qui que ce soit !
Je le tue !
Le livre est bien ?
Je me demande comment
le juge va s'en tirer.
Comment sais-tu ?
Vous lisiez toujours
à votre bureau à 20 h.
- Ca vous détend toujours ?
- Tu me connais trop.
J'entends des oiseaux.
Là où tu es, il fait jour.
Vous devenez fort à ce jeu.
J'entends aussi
de la tristesse dans ta voix.
C'est vous
qui me connaissez trop.
J'ai pensé à ma mère...
au moment où on se verra enfin.
Continue.
C'est seulement que...
on a été séparés si longtemps.
Est-ce qu'elle...
Peu importe.
Chacun rêve
d'un amour absolu chez sa mère.
Ca n'est pas toujours le cas.
Votre mère vous aimait ?
Je crois que oui.
Mais sache que si une mère
rejette sa progéniture,
l'enfant n'y estpour rien.
Ca montre souvent
que cette femme ne s'aime pas.
Je vous ai dit de me laisser !
Ca vous aidera
plus que la méthadone.
La clinique vous en a donné.
Mais la méthadone n'empêche pas
le manque d'héroïne.
Voilà pourquoi vous transpirez.
Vous êtes camé ?
J'ai étudié la toxicomanie.
Parole de scout.
C'est une racine biologique
à l'effet calmant.
Des amis la cultivent
dans l'Oregon.
Croyez-moi, ça marche.
C'est Chris ?
A 1 1 ans.
Son père me l'a envoyée
quand j'étais en cure.
Vous gardez sa photo
en essayant de l'oublier !
Je préfère seulement
qu'on ne se voie pas.
Vous êtes allée à l'hôpital.
J'ai regardé
la feuille de visites.
ll y avait
votre nom de jeune fille.
On m'a dit que Chris
était dans le coma.
Je suis allée voir mon fils.
Je n'ai pas eu la force
d'ouvrir la porte.
Ma mère.
Je ne l'ai presque jamais vue.
J'en sais peu sur elle,
mais je ferais tout
pour être dans ses bras.
Ecoutez...
lnutile de me dire que Chris
a besoin de moi,
que le passé est oublié.
Je suis une grande droguée,
mais une mère lamentable.
Vous êtes malade.
La maladie a contrôlé votre vie,
vous a isolée
de ceux que vous aimez.
Mais vous avez le courage
de lutter.
Vous trouverez la force
de revoir Chris.
Où sont les autres ?
Dans le coin.
Vraiment ? C'est drôle,
il n'y a que ta voiture
au parking.
J'ai du travail.
Pour le capitaine ?
Je dois finir
avant son arrivée.
Quand je serai capitaine,
tu m'obéiras ?
Je n'aime pas jouer !
Devinez ce que j'ai trouvé.
Je n'ai pas vu votre voiture.
J'ai pris le bus.
Pastèque sans graines.
Dieu sait
comment ils les retirent !
J'ai du travail.
A plus tard.
Si je suis fatigué,
vous devez être épuisée.
- Pourquoi ?
- Vous avez du travail,
vous vous entraîînez et en plus,
vous devez le supporter.
Comment ça ?
Regarder par-dessus votre épaule,
vous demander quand il arrivera,
ce qu'il voudra. La colère,
l'impuissance !
Ca me rongerait
au point de hurler.
Au début,
il me draguait gentiment.
Je pensais pouvoir maîîtriser Ca.
Mais il est tellement agressif.
ll me fait peur.
Etre la seule femme,
Ca doit être un fardeau.
Si je me plains,
j'aurai mauvaise presse.
Bobby niera et je serai
la brebis galeuse du groupe.
Si je ne suis pas virée.
C'est déjà assez dur comme ça.
Alors, je me tais.
Chris l'avait découvert ?
Un soir... Bobby m'a touchée.
J'étais bouleversée.
Chris m'a consolée.
ll était formidable !
ll avait ses problèmes,
mais il veillait sur moi.
ll était furieux contre Bobby.
ll a fait un rapport,
je n'ai pas pu le signer.
Vous auriez dû.
Vous n'êtes pas la première
à éprouver ça.
Bobby a déjà fait ça.
A Portland.
ll a failli perdre sa place.
Sa femme l'a presque quitté.
Mais il a forcé la victime
à se rétracter.
Je ne sais pas.
ll a des relations.
Bobby va devenir capitaine.
ll gagnera forcément.
Pas sûr.
Merci d'être venue.
Cet entretien
doit vous être pénible.
Mon intention
est d'éliminer les suspects,
pas de les incriminer.
Etant donné
que j'ai menacé Raines,
je suis votre suspect numéro 1 .
Et cet entretien a lieu
dans l'ancien bureau de mon père
car Raines pense
que ça me déconcertera.
Je ne comprends pas.
Mon père a disparu. Un clone
de Ralph Reed le remplace.
Qu'y a-t-il
de si difficile à comprendre,
docteur ?
Continuons.
Vous connaissez Jarod
depuis l'enfance.
Quelles sont vos relations ?
Mes relations...
consistent à le retrouver
et le ramener.
Vivant si possible.
Sinon, mort.
Que M. Raines tire sur Jarod
ne vous gênait pas ?
Pas du tout.
La fumée vous gêne ?
Vous ne cachez pas
votre hostilité envers M. Raines.
Est-ce parce que
vous vous sentiez protégée
par votre père ?
Papa n'a pas à me protéger
du balafré.
Vous pouvez développer ?
ll est mêlé
à la mort de ma mère
et sait où est mon père.
Qu'est-ce qui vous fait
croire ça ?
lntuition féminine.
Vous aimeriez donc le voir mort ?
J'aurais plaisir à l'autopsier
avant sa mort.
A votre arrivée,
je n'avais aucune opinion
concernant votre rôle
dans l'agression de M. Raines.
Avouez que
votre extrême franchise...
Sij'avais tiré,
espèce d'ordure,
vous seriez mort.
Est-ce que c'est clair ?
Vous aimez la pastèque, poète ?
Un ouvrier est coincé
sur un échafaudage.
Ces crétins comprendront jamais.
Et les autres ?
- On est seuls.
- Allons-y.
- On dirait un infarctus.
- Je commande, Spiderman.
C'est moi qui y vais.
De la corde.
Doucement.
Encore.
De la corde !
Vous êtes fou ?
Je veux
que vous soyez assez haut.
- Pour quoi ?
- Votre chute.
Ca va pas ?
Ca marchera.
Salut !
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Ce que vous avez fait à Chris
quand il vous a accusé
de harcèlement sexuel.
C'est une blague ou quoi ?
Ce n'est pas une blague, Bobby.
Je ne ris pas.
Vous délirez !
Vous deviez le faire taire,
pour votre promotion.
Vous avez suivi Chris à la tour
et coupé sa corde.
Vous avez fait croire
à une tentative de suicide.
C'est faux ! ll a laissé un mot !
Que vous avez écrit.
Si vous voulez,
j'en écrirai un pour vous.
D'accord ! J'ai coupé sa corde !
Je l'ai fait !
Maintenant, remontez-moi !
Pas question.
Ca, c'était poétique !
ll est temps, Dr Curtis.
Vous avez une conclusion ?
Une intime conviction ?
N'importe lequel a pu le faire.
Pas très satisfaisant.
Je regrette, M. Raines.
C'est ma seule conclusion,
d'après mes évaluations.
Dehors.
M. Parker sait peut-être
qui a appuyé sur la détente.
Où qu'il soit.
J'ai fait ce que vous vouliez.
J'ai dit que Ca pouvait être
n'importe qui.
Voilà qui est coupable
selon moi.
Nous sommes quittes.
Pour l'instant.
Un sauveteur tente de tuer
un de ses coéquipiers
ll y a du progrès ?
Ca dépend de son humeur.
S'il gardait le moral,
il pourrait retrouver 80%
de ses facultés.
Maman !
Je t'aime.
Moi aussi, je t'aime, Jarod.
Adaptation

Sous-titrage
NlCE FELLOw
Vu dans Le Caméléon :
Votre mère n'a pas dû
vous parler de cet endroit.
Non, en effet.
Elle venait en cette saison
chaque année.
Elle adorait le printemps.
Vous étiez amoureux d'elle ?
Elle gardait une part secrète
en elle.
M. Lyle arrive,
votre père disparaît.
Ca coïncide trop
pour être une coïncidence.
Qu'y a-t-il, Jarod ?
Je n'aime pas être observé.
Ton dessin le montre.
Tu veux queje sorte ?
Non, pas vous, Sydney.
Eux.
lls enregistrent tout, non ?
Partout oùje vais,
tout ce queje fais,
tout ce queje dis.
Coupez les caméras, Sydney.
Je ne les contrôle pas.
N'y fais pas attention.
lmpossible !
Vous ne comprenez pas ?
Je les sens.
Je ne peux rien y faire.
C'est injuste !
Coupez-les !
Souriez !
C'est fini !
Que fait le planning familial ?
Comment ça va ?
On fait une promo
pour les grands-parents.
J'ai une tête
à avoir un monospace ?
Vous le connaissez ?
Oui, c'est Jarod.
Adams.
ll a travaillé ici
et m'a donné ça.
Réconfortant !
Vous savez où il est ?
Non, mais il m'a dit
que quelqu'un passerait
chercher ça.
- Tenez.
- Je suis quelqu'un.
On est à Manhattan.
C'est du vol.
Allons, on est à Manhattan.
Vos parents doivent être fiers.
Excusez-moi.
Je crois que c'est pour vous.
Un appareil sans pellicule.
Tragique symbole !
Pourquoi ?
Parce que je vais devoir écouter
votre interprétation de ce jouet.
Je crois
que la disparition de votre père
vous stresse.
Ce qui me stresse, c'est Jarod.
Prenez des vacances,
ça vous détendrait.
Tirer dans la rotule de Jarod, aussi.
Mais je ne peux pas,
puisque j'ignore où il est,
n'est-ce pas ?
Souriez !
C'est dans la boîîte !
Super séance !
C'est mieux que
photographier des triplés.
Mauvaise mine.
Trop bonne mine.
Qu'elle fasse du sport !
Coiffée par un toiletteur
pour chiens !
Vous êtes un peu dur, non ?
Dur ? Je suis agent !
C'est une agence de mannequins,
pas un foyer d'accueil
pour ex-reines de beauté.
Vous avez vu le book de Jarod ?
lmpressionnant.
Non, exceptionnel. Vous avez
travaillé avec les plus grands.
Avedon, Penn, Newton...
On sent leur influence.
J'ai apprécié leurs livres.
Leurs livres... très drôle !
Vous photographiez
Cindy Thomas à 1 1 h 30.
ll paraîît qu'elle est exceptionnelle.
Elle manque d'expérience,
mais a un potentiel fou.
Jusqu'ici, aucun photographe
n'a su capturer
la qualité insaisissable
qui fera d'elle la prochaine...
Kimberly Green. Morte
dans un accident de voiture.
C'est la version officielle.
C'est faux ?
Un homme la suivait.
La police a conclu à un accident.
Je suis sûr qu'il l'a tuée.
On n'a pas retrouvé son corps.
Ni le maniaque ?
ll est toujours là, quelque part.
J'avais toute la collection
des Sentinelles de feu.
Quoi ?
C'est La Guerre des étoiles,
mais avec des marionnettes.
Un peu comme vous ?
Votre ligne était occupée.
J'appelais Saint-Thomas.
La villégiature de votre père.
J'ai eu son domestique
qui a toujours parlé anglais.
Mais aujourd'hui,
quand j'ai évoqué mon père,
il ne comprenait rien !
ll reviendra.
Alors ?
Vous avez reçu un colis.
Ca vient du Maine et ça bouge.
Jarod ?
A votre avis ?
Voici la pellicule manquante.
Serrez-vous la pince.
''Où est papa ?''
ll ne vit que pour me torturer.
Jarod ?
On avait rendez-vous
il y a 30 minutes.
J'ai eu une urgence. Hélas,
une fausse piste.
Dommage.
Vous êtes encore bredouilles ?
New York ?
ll était parti à notre arrivée.
Un indice sur sa destination ?
Rien que l'on puisse interpréter
de cette façon.
Regrettable !
Excellent avec de l'ail.
Je sors. Si on demande
où je suis, mentez.
Superbe, Cindy !
Formidable ! Génial !
Superbe !
Détends-toi, amuse-toi.
Sois une enfant.
Je ne dois pas être
provocante et sexy ?
C'est toi qu'on vend.
Alors, sois toi-même.
Je sais.
Souris !
C'est ça !
C'était génial !
Tu peux rentrer chez toi.
C'était un peu ridicule,
mais très sympa. Merci.
Le dernier cliché
fera peut-être notre couverture.
Exceptionnel. Brian a raison.
Mais par curiosité,
où avez-vous appris
cette technique ?
Au Studio Frimousse. Excusez-moi.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Désolé de vous avoir fait peur.
C'est rien.
J'étais en plein travail.
Une femme à barbe.
Certains paieraient cher
pour voir ça.
C'est qu'une expérience.
Plus de défauts.
Ce sont les défauts
qui sont intéressants.
Un photographe comme vous
sait ça.
Je suis retoucheur de photos.
J'ai cru
vous voir faire des photos.
J'ai l'habitude de l'appareil photo.
Mais ça n'est pas le cas de tous.
Je ne suis pas photographe.
Ca devait être votre sosie.
Enchanté de vous avoir connu.
Je t'assure, Cindy.
Miami est la capitale du beignet.
De la gastronomie cubaine,
peut-être, mais des beignets ?
J'ai goûté mon 1 er beignet ici.
C'est une longue histoire.
Tu as raison.
La ville est super.
J'adorais m'y promener,
mais après l'accident
de Kimberly...
Vous étiez amies ?
Un peu.
Elle était très secrète.
Elle n'était proche que de sa soeur.
Je ne lui en voulais pas.
C'est dur d'avoir des amis
quand on se méfie de tous.
Le maniaque...
ll a fait de sa vie un enfer.
ll lui envoyait des photos d'elle.
Quel genre ?
Son quotidien :
au supermarché, au restaurant...
Dessus,
il écrivait ''Tu es à moi''.
ll l'a même attaquée à l'acide.
Elle voulait simplement
être normale.
Je sais ce que c'est.
Un problème ?
Non, tout va bien.
Merci de m'avoir raccompagnée.
C'était un plaisir.
Coupez les caméras, Sydney !
Je ne les contrôle pas.
N'y fais pas attention.
lmpossible !
Vous ne comprenez pas ?
Je les sens tout le temps !
Je ne peux rien y faire.
C'est injuste !
Kimberly Green prend d'assaut
le monde de la mode
Un mannequin échappe
à une attaque à l'acide
Mort tragique d'un top model
C'était injuste, Kimberly.
Tout simplement injuste.
Un secret :
le homard
est un bon animal de compagnie.
ll a hurlé
quand je l'ai ébouillanté.
Où veux-tu en venir ?
ll s'agit de ton père,
ça me semblait clair.
Dis-moi où est mon père.
Dis-moi où sont mes parents !
Je ne sais pas.
Devine.
Ca n'est pas drôle.
Tu sais ce que j'éprouve.
Bonne chance.
Dis bonjour à Gladys pour moi.
Gladys ? Qui est...
Bonjour. Vous désirez ?
Mlle Parker !
Gladys.
Coupable.
Qu'est-ce que je fais ici,
au juste ?
Jarod a dit que vous trouveriez
ceci très précieux.
Une valeur sentimentale,
sûrement.
J'en pleurerais.
ll manque quelques pièces.
Vous voulez un peu de thé ?
Vous semblez tendue.
Je suis censée faire quoi ?
Du feu ?
Celui avec qui vous déjeunez
demain vous aidera.
Qui ça ? Où ?
Jarod a dit que vous sauriez.
Vous connaissez
''Chuck, le roi du homard'' ?
On ne saura jamais
la raison pour laquelle
un homme suivait Kimberly Green.
Maisj'ai identifié
des caractéristiques
communes à ce genre de personne
en entrant dans leur tête,
en prenant leur place,
en quelque sorte.
Tout d'abord, le maniaque
pense que la victime
lui appartient.
D'où une tentative de contrôler
sa vie par la peur.
En contrôlant les actions
de la victime par la peur,
il manipule sa capacité
à dialoguer
avec les autres.
Une peur qui se réalise
dans l'anonymat,
le refus d'une confrontation
avec la victime.
C'est ce que la victime
ne voitpas qui est terrifiant.
Et ce qui a pu arriver
dans le cas de Kimberly Green,
si une victime
rejette les tentatives...
de cette personne
pour contrôler sa vie,
alors le contrôle échappe
au coupable
et il a recours à la violence.
Zoe ?
Désolé.
Ca va, on a fini.
J'ai passé pas mal d'auditions,
mais rien de tel.
Comment vous appelez ça ?
Une simulation.
ll fallait que j'entre
dans la tête d'un criminel.
C'était du bon boulot.
Une question !
Pourquoi avoir parlé au flic ?
Un inconnu qui paie
pour me suivre,
c'est un peu tordu.
Je trouvais ça bizarre.
Désolé si c'était trop réaliste.
En voyant le flic...
j'ai eu envie
de vous effrayer un peu.
Ca a marché.
Je me souviens peu de mes rêves.
Mais celui-ci était vraiment...
J'étais dans une sorte de bar.
Tout le monde portait du cuir.
J'essayais de draguer
la serveuse.
Pendant tout ce temps-là,
je disais
des choses très intelligentes.
Vous savez,
comme dans les rêves...
Et soudain, elle se retourne
et c'est Mlle Parker.
Et là, ça m'excite vraiment.
Elle tend la main, m'entraîîne
par-dessus le comptoir...
et me met dans un mixer.
Désolé pour la séance.
Ce n'est pas une séance !
Je cherche Mlle Parker.
Vous l'avez vue ?
Pas depuis le déjeuner.
Je crois qu'elle a parlé
d'une piste sur Jarod.
Vraiment ?
Un déjeuner dans le Maine ?
Astucieux.
Qu'elle m'appelle à son retour...
de déjeuner.
Comment il sait,
pour nos séances ?
ll m'a entendu parler du mixer ?
Pardon, je vous avais pas vu.
Vous êtes doué, pour un amateur.
C'est ma passion.
C'est pas mal.
Vous l'avez capturée.
Si tout est comme ça,
montrez votre travail.
Jamais je pourrais faire ça.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
J'ai trouvé ça.
Maintenant, il est après moi.
Pourquoi ?
ll lui faut une autre cible.
lnstalle-toi chez moi.
J'engagerai un garde du corps.
Ca ne changera rien.
S'il veut m'avoir, il m'aura.
Comme il a eu Kimberly.
Bienvenue chez Chuck.
Je peux vous aider ?
Mlle Parker !
Je suis connue dans ce trou !
La table de Jarod est là.
Vous avez de la compagnie.
Jarod est ici ?
Je crains
que ça ne soit que moi.
Ben ?
Apparemment,
Jarod nous a piégés.
Pour la police, Kimberly Green
est morte par accident.
Mais sa soeur Erika,
comme beaucoup,
croit qu'elle a été tuée
par celui qui la harcelait.
Sa soeur Erika,
comme beaucoup,
croit qu'elle a été tuée...
La soeur du top model en deuil
Jarod Adams, photographe
de l'agence Faxon.
Je n'ai rien à vous dire.
Le maniaque est revenu.
ll harcèle
une amie de votre soeur.
Cindy Thomas.
Entrez.
Rien n'est pire
qu'être privé de sa famille.
Kimberly n'était pas
sa seule victime.
J'ai perdu ma seule famille.
Elle a été prise quand ?
Dans une famille d'accueil.
On a eu une drôle d'enfance.
Ca vous dépasse.
Vous avez tort.
On est passées de famille d'accueil
en famille d'accueil.
On ne savait jamais où on allait.
Mais Kimberly ne laissait personne
nous faire du mal.
C'est la 4e fois.
Pas question de changer.
Donnez-moi votre numéro
et je vous rappelle.
Ca m'aurait étonnée.
Je déteste qu'on envahisse
mon intimité.
Je vous comprends.
J'aurais aimé votre soeur.
Elle a l'air d'une battante.
C'est vrai.
Une seule chose la dépassait.
Le sentiment d'être piégée.
Par sa vie, par le maniaque.
L'un et l'autre étaient liés.
Elle cherchait une issue.
Elle a dû y penser
en tombant du pont.
Au moins, elle est en paix.
On a dragué la rivière,
mais le corps
n'a pas été retrouvé.
561 Renseignements.
Oui, Boca Raton, Floride.
Vous désirez ?
Merci. C'est tout
ce dont j'avais besoin.
Pas étonnant
qu'on vous sollicite, Erika.
Ca va ?
Oui, je vais bien.
Ne refaisjamais ça.
Je t'ai cru mort.
J'ai pensé qu'en prétendant
être mort, j'aurais la paix.
Vous êtes comme moi, Kimberly.
Comme moi.
- La même chose.
- Bien, Mlle Parker.
Un cadeau de Jarod. Je crois
que je suis au bout du rouleau.
J'en ai bien peur.
Ca fait des années !
C'était à vous ?
Non, à votre mère.
Jarod a passé du temps chez moi.
Ca devient plus clair.
Quoi ?
L'intérêt qu'il portait
à votre mère et...
à ça.
ll a dit que quand on se verrait,
je devais
vous donner ça.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi,
je l'ai gardée sur moi.
Elle danse à l'intérieur.
Ca ne marche pas
sans l'autre figurine.
Désolé, j'ignore où elle est.
Je la croyais perdue.
Mais Jarod l'a trouvée
dans le grenier
avec d'autres affaires
de votre mère.
J'étais là
quand elle l'a achetée.
Ca me rappelait
sa beauté délicate.
Sa démarche gracieuse de danseuse.
Ma mère était danseuse ?
Et comment !
Elle ne vous l'a jamais dit ?
Je découvre qu'elle m'a caché
beaucoup de choses.
Voilà pourquoi
j'ai pris tant de leçons !
Vous dansez toujours ?
Non, j'ai arrêté quand elle...
Elle aussi a arrêté...
quand elle a connu votre père.
Savez-vous où est mon père ?
ll a disparu.
Jarod m'a fait venir ici
pour le retrouver.
Désolé, je ne sais rien
sur votre père.
Seulement votre mère.
Ca a pu être pris
n'importe quand !
Vous savez que non.
Je sais que vous appelez
votre soeur chaque soir.
Je suis innocent.
Je dois vous croire ?
Je sais où est Kimberly.
Si je voulais
envahir son intimité,
je ne serais pas
en train de vous parler.
Aidez-la à me faire confiance.
Je sais ce qu'elle ressent.
Personne ne le sait.
Moi, si.
Je te l'ai dit,
tu n'as rien à craindre.
lls ne te regardentpas.
C'est la seule caméra du bureau.
Je l'ai décrochée ce matin.
Souviens-toi,
c'est une faveur queje te fais.
Je dois la remettre bientôt.
On peutparler ?
Rien que vous et moi ?
Fais tout ce que tu veux.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
ll y a quelque chose
dans la pendule.
Juste au milieu.
Vous disiez
qu'ils ne regardaientpas !
Je ne savais pas.
Vous disiez
queje n'avais rien à craindre !
Allez au diable !
Après l'agression,
je ne pouvais
que mettre en scène ma mort.
D'un piège à l'autre.
Au lieu de vivre un cauchemar,
j'en fais.
Sur quoi ?
Toujours la même chose.
Ses yeux.
Le soir où il m'a agressée,
j'ai senti son regard
toute la journée.
Devant chez moi,
je me suis retournée...
et il était là,
il portait une cagoule.
ll a essayé de me jeter
de l'acide au visage.
Je ne me rappelle que ses yeux.
Parlez-m'en.
lls étaient froids.
Sans sentiment.
Vous ne vous sentiez protégée
nulle part ?
Chez moi et à l'agence.
Mais à la fin,
je me sentais épiée partout.
J'étais paranoïaque.
J'en doute.
Le grand public ignore
qui est Cindy Thomas.
Mais pas le maniaque.
ll aurait accès à l'agence ?
Je ne sais pas.
Aidez-moi à le découvrir.
Aidez-moi à retrouver ces yeux.
C'est la seule issue de ce piège.
Croyez-moi.
Je pense avoir un moyen.
La relation
entre votre mère et moi
a duré presque quinze ans
avant sa mort.
Je la revois marcher
vers l'auberge,
par un beau jour d'avril.
J'étais sur une échelle
quand elle m'a appelé.
Sa voiture était en panne.
Elle avait essayé de la réparer.
Elle était couverte de cambouis.
Vous l'avez aidée à réparer ?
Elle m'a aidé à me soigner.
Je suis tombé de l'échelle.
Elle aidait toujours les autres.
Même quand elle était
dans le besoin.
C'est là
que vous êtes tombés amoureux ?
C'est là
qu'on est devenus amis.
On l'a été pendant des années.
Elle venait chaque année
début avril
et restait deux semaines.
Je vivais dans l'attente
de ces moments.
Ca peut sembler bête, mais
elle aimait les choses simples :
cueillir des fleurs près du lac,
regarder les étoiles...
Catherine avait
une soif de vivre infinie.
Une étincelle.
Jusqu'à...
Sa rencontre avec mon père ?
Au début, elle semblait heureuse.
Mais au fil des ans,
l'étincelle a pâli.
Mais elle continuait à venir.
J'étais une oasis
dans la vie où elle étouffait.
Elle ne me parlait jamais
de cette vie.
Rien que de ses sentiments.
Elle était comme ça avec moi.
C'était des années
avant que nos lèvres se touchent.
Je crois sincèrement
qu'on était faits l'un pour l'autre.
Mais on n'a pu avoir que cela.
C'est affreux...
de savoir qu'elle était si triste.
Elle l'était, avant vous.
A votre naissance,
l'étincelle est revenue.
Vous lui avez donné la force
de se rappeler qui elle était.
Elle était en train
de changer de vie.
Mais elle est partie.
Elle me manque.
A moi aussi.
Ne soyez pas triste.
Elle n'était pas triste
en parlant de vous.
Et elle ne voulait parler
que de vous.
Quelle était l'autre figurine ?
Une danseuse, une petite fille.
Dommage
qu'elles ne dansent plus ensemble.
Que faites-vous ici ?
Votre travail.
C'est excellent.
Dire que personne ne l'a vu !
Je vous l'ai dit, c'est impossible.
Vous êtes doué, Toby.
L'appareil photo parle pour vous.
Ce sont des personnes superbes.
Je ne suis pas des leurs.
La beauté n'est pas qu'apparence.
ll y a aussi de l'émotion.
Dans les yeux
de ceux que vous photographiez,
je vois de l'émotion.
Que voulez-vous ?
Toby a pris ces photos ?
De tous ceux qui étaient là.
Alors ?
ll n'était peut-être pas là.
ll a pu changer ses habitudes.
Ceux qui traquent une proie
font toujours pareil.
ll était là.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
ll y a une silhouette au fond.
Mon Dieu !
Brian...
Trop bouffie.
Pas assez diaphane.
Bob Vila pourrait peut-être
photographier ses mains.
Pour vous, Brian.
M. Faxon,
vous avez Paris en ligne.
Tu es à moi
Kimberly ?
Bonjour, Brian.
Ca va pas ?
Je m'appelle Zoe.
Pardon, j'ai cru que...
Qui est là ?
Vous êtes piégé.
Ca fait quoi ?
lci, Brian.
Par ici !
Vous ne nous voyez pas.
Mais on vous voit.
Le pouvoir est à nous.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Je suis vous, Brian.
Je suis faible, je suis lâche.
Je me cache pour épier.
Faire peur aux autres
me donne de la force.
Que voulez-vous ?
Vous vous sentez piégé ?
Vulnérable ?
Terrifié ?
Comme Kimberly et Cindy.
Vous avez peur
que je vous fasse du mal ?
Le pire,
c'est que vous ignorez comment.
Et vous ignorez quand.
C'est ça, le harcèlement.
Pas vrai ?
Avouez-le, Brian.
Elles vous ont repoussé
et ça vous a déchiré.
Je voulais être avec elles !
Vous vouliez contrôler !
Ca n'a pas marché avec Kimberly.
Vous l'avez suivie et piégée,
vous avez voulu la détruire...
avec de l'acide.
Et vous avez fait pareil
avec Cindy.
Je voulais seulement
qu'elles soient à moi.
Maintenant,
c'est vous qui êtes à moi.
Détendez-vous.
Ca n'est que du CO2 et de l'eau.
On dirait que tu as vu
un fantôme, Brian !
Je croyais que tu étais...
Non, je ne le suis pas.
Et je n'ai plus peur.
Laissez parler votre book.
Darrin va adorer votre travail.
J'aurais jamais cru
que ce jour viendrait.
Quoi qu'il arrive,
merci, Jarod.
Faites un malheur !
Le maniaque
derrière les barreaux
Jolie, non ?
La musique.
ll n'y a jamais de musique
à la fin de tes jeux.
Désolé que tu n'aies pas fait
bon voyage.
Mais tu as tout
pour trouver ce que tu cherches.
Bon voyage
Pourquoi m'avoir donné ça ?
Pour te souhaiter
un bon anniversaire.
Mon anniversaire
n'est que le 3 janvier.
Justement.
Elle venait chaque année
début avril.
Mai, juin, juillet,
août, septembre, octobre,
novembre, décembre...
Je le cherchais partout.
Papa ?
Ca va, mon ange ?
Tu as braconné dans mon bureau ?
Tu as été absent un mois.
Où étais-tu ?
Je ne peux pas te protéger.
Viens, M. Lyle et M. Raines
nous attendent.
Ecoute ton père
et suis-moi.
Bien sûr.

NlCE FELLOw
Vu dans Le Caméléon :
Angelo est comme une éponge,
il absorbe les traits des autres.
ll nous aidera à trouver Jarod.
Vous n'êtes plus seul.
Je m'appelle Brigitte.
Je fais mon boulot.
Vous ne saboterez pas l'opération.
Un curieuxphénomène
se présente chez Jarod.
Ce matin,
il ignorait sa propre identité.
On doit commencer, Jarod.
Pourquoi ce nom ?
C'est le tien.
Je ne sais pas
à quoije ressemble.
Ca te fait quel effet ?
Comme sije n'existais plus.
Je veux savoir quije suis.
Aucun doute,
toutes ces simulations ont
provoqué
ce trouble de l'identité.
Je crains que,
s'il continue à s'effacer,
il perde sa véritable identité,
pour toujours.
ll est parti.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
ll semble que Jarod s'intéresse
à l'art classique.
Aphrodite n'avait pas
des lolos pareils.
Je dirais que M. Peabody
est en pleine crise de puberté.
Pourquoi sculpter
des femmes, sinon ?
Dr Clay ?
J'en ai eu pour mon argent.
Vous êtes un artiste.
Le travail mène à la perfection.
Touche son visage.
Dis-moi ce que tu ressens.
Tristesse.
Douleur.
Honte.
La douleur de qui ?
La tristesse et la honte de qui ?
ll ressent ce qu'a ressenti Jarod
en faisant ça ?
On commence
tout juste à comprendre
le don d'empathie d'Angelo.
Mais il peut nous dire
ce que Jarod simulait
ou les émotions
suscitées par les statues.
Ou celles de l'ouvrier
qui a emballé la pâte à modeler.
Douleur.
Tristesse.
Honte.
J'ai des émotions.
Le bonheur n'en fait pas partie.
Joli dessin.
Ca vous a pris du temps ?
Ma fille Debbie l'a fait.
Un miracle,
après ce qui s'est passé.
Vous ne me demandez rien ?
Si j'entends encore parler
de votre ex-femme
et de son footballeur,
je vais gerber.
ll ne s'agit pas d'elle.
De quoi, alors ?
Je peux vous faire confiance ?
Je m'en vais.
Quelqu'un me surveille.
On est au Centre.
Quelqu'un surveille
tout le monde.
Pas au Centre.
Debbie était chez moi.
Partout, je me sentais épié.
Chez le glacier, au zoo, chez moi.
Assis !
Je suis suivi.
Broots, avez-vous
des preuves tangibles ?
Des pas,
du bruit dans les fourrés.
A notre arrivée, hier soir,
c'était éteint.
Je laisse toujours allumé.
Vous avez une ampoule grillée.
On le savait.
Douleur.
Tristesse.
Quel dommage !
Votre mammoplastie...
Une belle fille comme ça
méritait 90 de tour de poitrine.
J'ai suivi la norme.
Au-delà, elle aurait basculé.
Très drôle !
Vous en êtes au dessert ?
On va exciser le défaut.
Vous traînez.
J'ai une rhytidectomie à 10 h.
Quoi, Ray ? T'as peur
de louper une promotion ?
Rhytidectomie à 1 0 h.
ll semble irritable.
La clinique de Santa Barbara
lui est passée sous le nez.
Vous refermez ?
J'aimerais regarder votre technique.
On dit que vous laissez
peu de cicatrices.
Je n'en laisse pas.
- Votre secret ?
- Le tracé des points
et des nerfs d'acier.
Mon vieux s'est marré quand
je me suis inscrit au macramé.
Qui se marre, là ?
Oui, Debbie. Papa va bien.
Je suis occupé.
Tu me manques aussi.
Reste chez maman
quelques jours
et puis, tu reviendras.
Et fais-moi plaisir.
Fais-moi un autre beau dessin.
Oui, je l'ai ici.
Je l'adore.
Moi aussi, je t'aime.
Au revoir, ma puce.
Alignement parfait.
L'incision est quasi invisible.
Belle assistance.
Où vous avez été formé ?
A Princeton, Harvard...
et la pâte à modeler.
La pâte à modeler ?
Très drôle !
Un truc pas drôle :
j'ai pas été payé.
Je suis pas venu à Beverly Hills
pour rester sur la touche.
Croyez-moi, l'argent viendra.
On ne traite pas des démunis.
L.A. est plein
de gens riches et vaniteux
sous un soleil ravageur.
C'est de l'or.
Je me suis payé une Boxter.
Cash.
Et question nanas,
vous voyez
la fille de Hellraiser 2 ?
Je sors avec elle.
En fait, j'ai remodelé ses fesses.
Elle doit être 2 fois mieux
que dans Hellraiser 1.
Encore en train de frimer
avec les pétasses ?
Dr Brant.
wade.
Dr Clay ?
Christine Brant, chef de service.
Enchanté.
Vous êtes formé
en trauma maxillaire.
On a un blessé avec de graves
blessures faciales. Pour vous.
J'arrive. Ravi...
Le temps, c'est de l'argent.
Vous cherchez quelque chose ?
Je finirai par le trouver.
Du calme, M. Broots.
Je viens vous aider...
pour votre problème de voyeur.
Comment vous savez ?
Pas important.
Ce qui est important,
c'est que je vous crois.
Reste à savoir
pourquoi vos amis
ne vous croient pas.
C'est pas qu'ils me croient pas...
lls ne peuvent pas vous croire fou.
lls ont peut-être
quelque chose à cacher.
On sait comment traiter
un homme de votre calibre.
On peut vous protéger.
Qui ça, ''on'' ?
Ceux sur qui vous pouvez compter.
Je vous souhaite de trouver
ce que vous cherchez.
Peur.
Papa a peur.
Papa a peur.
Sacrée grosse oreille.
Vous ne plaisantiez pas.
Remarquable,
cette pâte à modeler.
On est censé la cuire,
mais je m'en sers pour m'entraîîner
à la blépharoplastie
et à l'otoplastie.
Vous êtes en manque de crac-crac.
C'est un nouveau jeu ?
Pas exactement.
Des soucis sur votre patient ?
Non, mais je ferai
une visite de contrôle.
C'est un subventionné.
Pas de contrôle.
On l'opère à l'oeil.
Qu'il s'estime heureux.
A l'oeil ?
J'ai pas fait 7 ans d'études
pour ça.
Une fois par semaine.
Je commence à m'interroger.
L'argent, les stars ?
J'ai même pas vu de starlette.
Pas encore.
Brant s'en occupe.
Et on hérite des B.A. ?
Aider les pauvres,
c'est le dada de Brant.
Et le vôtre,
si vous tenez à votre place.
Soyons clairs.
On ne fait pas
que donner aux acteurs
un rôle dans leur prochain film.
On pratique gratuitement
la chirurgie réparatrice.
Si vous voulez faire l'un,
vous devrez
faire votre part de l'autre.
Jolie oreille.
On devrait lui coudre
une ceinture au cou.
Un accident de voiture
fait un mort et un blessé
Blessée, l'étudiante
abandonne ses études
Pourquoi fais-tu ça ?
Je suis personne
Ne m'appelez pas comme ça.
Je suis personne !
Tu ne peuxpas
te fuir éternellement.
Sa résistance continue.
ll refuse les simulations,
les interactions
et même la nourriture.
Cet isolement auto-infligé
est un phénomène nouveau.
Je m'inquiète pour son avenir.
Vous désirez ?
Bonjour. Je suis le Dr Clay,
de Surgicare.
Je viens voir Tricia.
Personne n'est venu la voir.
Justement.
Son amie, qui conduisait...
Dieu ait son âme.
Elle a traversé le pare-brise.
Tricia a de la chance
d'être en vie.
Elle n'est pas d'accord.
A cause de son visage,
elle ne sort pas.
Cette enfant a une voix divine.
Ca lui a valu
une bourse d'études.
Elle ne s'en servira plus jamais.
Jamais, c'est loin.
- Vous êtes mélomane, aussi ?
- C'est à Tricia.
Un cadeau mystérieux.
lls ont commencé à arriver
un mois après l'accident.
Pas de carte, pas d'adresse.
Dieu les bénisse.
ll n'y a que ça
qui la rende heureuse.
Je peux la voir ?
Tricia, tu as de la visite.
Tu aimes le blues ?
C'est ma musique préférée.
Je suis le Dr Clay.
Vous pouvez réparer mon visage ?
Je ne sais pas.
C'est dur de voir à travers ça.
Je ne veux pas.
Quand j'avais ton âge,
je ne sortais jamais.
Je ne suis pas sorti
pendant 30 ans.
C'est une longue histoire.
Quand je suis sorti,
j'ai compris
ce que j'avais manqué.
Les arbres...
l'air frais...
le soleil.
La vie est un don.
Rien ne vaut
qu'on passe à côté.
Ravi de t'avoir connue.
Attendez.
Tu as de beaux yeux.
lls sont bleus ?
Violets.
Ma nouvelle couleur préférée.
Qui va là ?
Papa a peur.
J'ai besoin d'un conseil.
- Médical ou féminin ?
- Les deux.
Ceci appartient à un top model.
Mannequin ou top model ?
Top.
Fracture du mandibule.
On peut opérer
sans provoquer une paralysie ?
Le pape est catholique ?
C'est obligatoire, je crois.
Entre les mains du Maîître,
elle sera plus belle
après qu'avant.
Le 7e nerf crânien
est près de la fracture.
Vous êtes sûr de pouvoir l'éviter ?
Le plus dur sera d'obtenir du labo
le sang A négatif
dont elle aura besoin.
Un top model ?
Elle sort avec quelqu'un ?
Je ne crois pas.
Je serais ravi
de vous la présenter.
Dr Eubanks,
je vous présente Tricia Holmes.
Je me souviens de vous.
La fracture du mandibule.
Comme le top model.
Vous devez vous souvenir
du résultat.
Le rameau postérieur
est abîîmé et le nerf
facial droit a été coupé.
Qu'est-il arrivé ?
A vous de me le dire.
Vous étiez pressé ?
Un rendez-vous galant ?
Avec les pauvres, vous bâclez.
Je donne le meilleur
de moi-même à mes patients.
Sauf pour les visites de contrôle.
Coupable. Mais j'applique
la politique de la maison.
Je suis un bon chirurgien.
Je n'ai pas pu faire ça.
- Vous avez réduit la fracture ?
- Complètement.
Et le nerf était intact ?
Ses blessures
n'étaient pas si profondes.
Je ne lui ai pas fait ça,
je vous le jure.
Si ce n'est pas vous,
qui est-ce ?
La boucle est bouclée.
En effet !
Broots, une dernière question.
Pourquoi ne pas prendre un avocat ?
Je vous dis que sans Angelo,
je serais mort.
ll m'a sauvé. C'est un héros.
Le singe est sorti du zoo.
Comment ?
J'ai trouvé cette carte
dans sa poche.
Qui sait comment il l'a eue ?
En tout cas, il vous a sauvé.
Vous ne me croyez pas ?
Et ces photos ?
Faites-en des cartes de Noël.
C'est l'heure de le coucher.
Emmenez-le.
Vous ne me croyez pas non plus ?
Je ne sais pas trop que croire.
J'ai trouvé ça
près de chez vous.
Des douilles.
Du 9 mm,
ce qu'utilise le Centre.
Et il y avait ça...
à côté.
Mlle Parker veut ma peau.
On vous protégera.
Mais on n'a rien sans rien.
Que voulez-vous ?
Mlle Parker ?
Je veux savoir
où elle va et à qui elle parle.
Vous aurez besoin de ça.
Je ne sais pas trop.
La loi du plus fort.
A vous de choisir.
A vos souhaits.
A mes souhaits...
Comment es-tu sorti ?
Donne-moi ça.
C'est à moi.
Ce n'était pas Mlle Parker.
C'était Brigitte.
Mlle Atchoum va bien ?
Je viens de la croiser.
Que faites-vous avec ça ?
Vous voulez
que je vous fasse mal ?
On les a trouvées devant chez moi.
Les douilles de votre arme.
Et vos mégots.
Semés par Brigitte.
C'est elle qui me suit.
A qui est cette carte ?
Amateurs !
Jarod, où es-tu ?
Mon Dieu.
Que fais-tu ?
Je cherche. Je me cherche.
Tu t'appelles Jarod.
Tu as un don merveilleux
à offrir au monde.
Un don qui peut aider les gens.
ll suffit que tu croies en toi,
de nouveau.
A quoije ressemble ?
Je veux savoir quije suis.
De l'histoire ancienne.
C'est moi au club de théâtre.
J'avais le 1 er rôle dans Grease.
On portait du cuir,
dans la Grèce antique ?
C'est moi à la chorale.
Soliste soprano ?
Tu réussissais dans tout !
Pas en football.
Tu dois avoir hâte
de reprendre tes activités.
Qui voudra d'une artiste
avec cette tête ?
Si vous ne m'arrangez pas,
je renonce aux études.
Je regrette,
mais je ne peux rien faire.
Le nerf n'est pas récupérable.
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
Qu'ai-je fait pour mériter ça ?
Vous ne savez pas ce que c'est
d'être la risée de tous.
D'être montrée du doigt
comme un monstre.
J'ai connu l'exclusion.
Ca m'a rendu plus fort.
Je ne veux pas être plus forte.
Je veux être moi.
Je veux
redevenir elle.
Elle est partie.
Pour toujours.
Pas son don.
Ta chambre est pleine
de choses qui te passionnent.
Ton visage n'est qu'une partie
de qui tu es.
Toi seule détiens la clé
de son avenir.
Je sais que la vie
est un drôle de voyage...
mais pour le vivre...
il faut sortir de chez toi.
- Comment va ma puce ?
- Mieux.
J'espère.
Ceci est arrivé.
Ouvrez-le.
Mon arthrite me fait des misères.
Encore des cadeaux
du mystérieux ami.
lls ont tous le même cachet ?
De Santa Barbara.
- M. Hawthorne.
- Dr Clay.
Navré de vous bousculer.
Le Dr Brant
voulait régler ça sans délai.
Votre appel était un peu vague.
Un problème ?
ll y a eu une fuite
sur l'affaire Tricia Holmes.
Je n'irai pas par quatre chemins.
Le Dr Brant veut votre coopération,
ou tout Ca disparaîît.
Je ne me rappelle pas
chaque patient.
C'est une bonne réponse
pour le conseil de l'ordre.
lls ouvrent une enquête.
Je n'ai rien dit à personne.
Vous devez déclarer
que vous n'avez rien vu d'anormal,
ce soir-là.
Et Tricia Holmes
pourra retourner cacher sa laideur
pendant que le Dr Brant et vous
profiterez de ceci.
Marché conclu ?
Je ne mentirai plus pour elle.
ll était 2 h du matin
quand Tricia Holmes
est revenue du bloc.
Le Dr Eubanks avait fait
un excellent travail.
Elle se reposait.
Tout était calme.
- Et Brant est arrivée.
- Elle était hystérique.
Elle remodelait le menton
d'une star
et les implants osseux
avaient été abîîmés.
Elle avait besoin d'un donneur,
et vite.
Elle a lu la fiche de Tricia.
Sans broncher,
elle a pris un scalpel.
Elle ne l'a même pas
reconduite
au bloc opératoire.
Elle a rouvert son visage
et prélevé de l'os
pour sa star de cinéma.
Dans sa précipitation,
elle a sectionné le nerf facial.
Brant m'a promu pour me faire taire.
Depuis, je suis piégé.
Demandez à Tricia
ce que c'est qu'être piégé.
Rude journée, Brigitte.
Vous savez ce qu'on dit :
''Les femmes au travail...''
Vous semblez fatiguée.
Mais la filature,
c'est dur, pour une jeunette.
On veille tard,
on attend des heures...
Vous autres Américains
ne parlez pas le même anglais.
Navrée, je ne vous suis pas.
Mon père est revenu.
Vous n'avez pas eu son feu vert.
C'était donc une initiative
indépendante.
Vous avez tiré sur Broots ?
Si j'avais tiré sur Broots,
il serait mort.
Pas si le but était de l'intimider.
Qui a donné l'ordre ?
Vous le savez aussi bien que moi.
Raines.
C'est son style.
C'est logique
de viser le plus faible.
C'était dur de choisir.
Mettez-vous Ca dans le crâne.
Broots est peut-être un idiot,
mais c'est mon idiot.
La seule qui le terrorise,
c'est moi.
Pointez une arme sur moi.
Vous aurez pas le cran de tirer.
Mais si vous touchez encore
à un des mes équipiers,
je troue votre petite tête blonde.
lls m'ont dit
que vous étiez pas une garce.
lls étaient gentils.
Si ça vous intéresse,
c'est moi qui ai tiré
sur M. Broots,
mais je n'ai pas pris de photos.
On fête quoi ?
C'est ma façon de vous remercier
pour m'avoir offert
le meilleur boulot du monde.
Vous êtes ma meilleure recrue.
Vous vexez pas.
Vous opérez ces cas sociaux
à un rythme record.
Ca nous laisse le temps
de vaquer à d'autres... priorités.
Des week-ends au rodéo,
retaper la maison sur la plage...
Coupable.
Ca va, Christine ?
Je n'ai rien mangé.
Vous avez bu un coup de trop.
Si wade me prête sa voiture,
je vous raccompagne.
Chauffeur, en plus ?
J'ai recruté le bon type.
C'était quoi, ce champagne ?
Une cuvée très spéciale.
Si vous continuez comme ça,
vous allez noyer le moteur.
D'après Eubanks,
elle fait du 220 km/h.
On va voir si c'est vrai.
Dr Brant ?
Vous m'entendez ?
On a eu un grave accident.
Je n'ai rien ?
Vous saignez un peu.
Vous en faites pas.
Pas de traumatisme.
C'est purement
cosmétique.
Mon visage ?
C'est grave ?
C'est superficiel.
Je peux réparer ça.
Dieu soit loué.
Mais il y a
une légère complication.
On a un gros client
dans le bloc d'à côté.
Un top model.
Elle fait une allergie au peeling.
Elle a besoin d'implants cutanés.
Heureusement,
on a un donneur parfait.
Vous.
Moi ?
Je ne donne pas ma peau.
Je serais défigurée.
Je regrette.
C'est la seule solution.
Vous êtes fou ?
Vous ne pouvez pas me faire ça !
Mais si.
Comme vous l'avez fait
à Tricia Holmes.
Consolez-vous.
Je vous informe
que je vais prélever
un bout de vous
pour quelqu'un d'autre.
C'est ce que vous avez fait.
Vous lui avez pris
un bout d'os
pour votre gros client.
Et vous avez sectionné
son nerf facial.
Oui, j'ai fait ça !
Laissez-moi partir !
C'est impossible.
Mais je vous promets
de faire plus attention avec vous
que vous avec elle.
Pas de panique.
Votre visage
est encore anesthésié.
Ce qu'il en reste.
Vous êtes fou.
Ce n'est pas gentil, docteur.
J'ai fait de mon mieux,
sachant que je ne suis pas
chirurgien.
Un chirurgien plastique arrêté
pour faute médicale
Elle ne viendra pas.
Faites-lui confiance.
Tu es splendide.
Je t'accompagne ?
Merci.
La vie est un drôle de voyage
et il est temps
que je m'y replonge.
Voici à quoi tu ressembles.
Voici qui tu es.
Brigitte a tiré,
mais n'a pas pris les photos.
On sait. C'est arrivé ce matin.
C'est quoi, cette histoire ?
On veut nous faire peur.
On y travaille.
Angelo ?
En colère.
Egaré.
En colère.
Qui est en colère ?
C'est une perte de temps.
Je décide de qui vit ou meurt.
Je décide de qui vit ou meurt.

NlCE FELLOw
Vu dans Le Caméléon :
Broots se bat
pour la garde de sa fille.
Le privé cherchait
quelque chose sur son ex.
Grâce à vous,
ma fille est en larmes.
Demain,
elle retourne chez sa mère,
à contrecoeur.
M. Lyle...
Ce monstre estpartout.
- Qui est ce type ?
- Je n'en sais rien.
C'est ce qui me faitpeur.
Salut, Kevin. La même chose ?
Ma mère vous félicite d'avoir fait
partir l'autre vendeur de glaces.
Vendre de la drogue aux enfants,
ça mérite la prison.
Et c'est là qu'il est.
Ravi d'avoir été utile.
- C'est quoi ?
- Une boule noire magique.
- Magique ?
- Secouez-la.
Posez une question.
Elle prédit l'avenir.
- Je peux essayer ?
- Allez-y.
Je vais trouver ma famille ?
Elle dit quoi ?
''C'est trop tôt
pour vous le dire.''
Je me trouve devant
le tribunal fédéral, juste après
l'enlèvement du témoin
Emma Barrett. ll y a 18 mois,
Mlle Barrett, 37 ans, assistait
au meurtre de son fils Max,
atteintpar une balle perdue
lors d'une fusillade
impliquant le chefyakusa
Sammy Tanaka,
dans ce que le FBl
qualifie de 'frappe chirurgicale''.
Le fourgon conduisant Mlle Barrett
à témoigner contre Tanaka
était le troisième véhicule
d'un convoi blindé.
La victime arrivera
dans le troisième véhicule
d'un convoi blindé.
Selon les nombreux témoins,
la scène semblait sortie d'un film.
Des grenades à fumée bleue
ont explosé sur la place.
Des grenades à fumée colorée
serontplacées ici et là.
Pourquoi cette personne
a été enlevée ?
C'est sans importance.
J'ai besoin
que tu termines
le plan de sauvetage.
Comme la victime
est dans ce véhicule,
je suggère
un 2e et un 3e scénario.
Des tirs à l'arme automatique
de cet immeuble
et un faux accident de voiture.
Ca rendrait
le fourgon vulnérable.
L'attaque du fourgon
a été suivie
de 2 autres scénarios :
des tirs à l'arme automatique
et un faux accident
détournant l'attention
du fourgon qui transportait
le témoin-clé de l'accusation.
ll y a deux blessés
pour l'instant.
L'agent Russell Gillson
et le chauffeur du fourgon,
l'agent Jeffrey Edwards.
- A l'hôpital...
- ll reste un problème.
Pour réussir le sauvetage,
le chauffeur devra mourir.
On vient d'apprendre
que le chauffeur du fourgon,
Jeffrey Edwards, est mort.
ll avait 35 ans
et laisse une femme
et deuxjeunes fils.
Le chauffeur devra mourir.
Mon Dieu !
Le chauffeur devra mourir.
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
J'ai tué un homme.
Comme si j'avais moi-même tiré.
Simulation 2578. Vous m'aviez dit
qu'il s'agissait d'un sauvetage.
ll a servi à tuer un agent du FBl
et à enlever une innocente.
- Le Centre n'enlève pas les gens.
- Dis-le à Emma Barrett.
C'est Lyle ?
De quoi tu parles ?
Je parle de mensonges,
de gens qui sont morts
à cause de mes simulations.
Vous vous êtes servi de moi.
Plus personne ne mourra.
Si le Centre veut la guerre,
il l'aura,
mais Emma Barrett ne sera pas
votre prochaine victime.
Quelque chose te tracasse ?
Jarod vient de nous appeler.
Pour se rendre, j'espère.
ll accuse le Centre
de l'enlèvement
d'un témoin qui a vu
son fils se faire tuer.
- Par qui ?
- Un chef yakusa, Sammy Tanaka.
Un nom qui fait peur.
D'après Jarod, l'enlèvement
s'inspirait d'une simulation
qu'il a faite
juste avant son évasion.
Je lui ai assuré
que le Centre n'y était pour rien.
C'était peut-être une erreur.
Ne me dis pas
que le Centre
fraye avec des mafieux ?
Les choses ont changé
depuis que M. Lyle est... M. Lyle.
Arrête-le.
On l'arrêtera.
Papa, tu as participé
à la construction du Centre.
Tu tiens à ce qu'il représente.
Ne fais pas
comme si de rien n'était.
Les choses étaient différentes.
ll est peut-être temps
de céder la place à un jeune lion.
Des coups de feu !
Modèle de série.
Faux accident de voiture.
Des coups de feu !
Arme automatique.
Je suis touché !
Ecran de fumée colorée.
Rendre le fourgon vulnérable.
lls ont Barrett !
Me Darrell ?
Je suis Jessica Klein.
Appelez-moi Jarod.
Le ministère m'a prévenue
de votre arrivée.
Vous avez fait vite.
Nous avons beaucoup de travail.
Je connais bien les avocats
à washington. Vous êtes nouveau ?
J'ai commencé aujourd'hui.
Dans le feu de l'action.
C'est signé Sammy Tanaka
et ses yakusa.
Vous défendez Emma Barrett ?
Elle en a trop subi.
Elle a perdu son fils.
Depuis un an, elle vivait
dans la peur et l'isolement,
et maintenant, ça.
Pourquoi c'est si long ?
Vous avez lu le dossier
sur Tanaka.
Le ministère essaie
de le coincer depuis 1 0 ans.
lls veulent que tout soit en place
avant d'aller au procès.
Vous voulez interroger
l'agent impliqué ?
Volontiers.
- Comment était le tireur ?
- Blanc.
Les cheveux blancs.
Environ 35 ans.
- Et les autres ?
- Je n'ai pas bien vu.
Les sourcils plus épais.
Voilà.
Comment vous sentez-vous ?
Je suis navré, Mlle Klein.
Jarod, l'agent Russell Gillson.
Jarod est un avocat
de washington.
David Chase,
agent de terrain, FBl.
J'aimerais vous interroger
sur l'enlèvement d'Emma Barrett.
C'est arrivé si vite.
Tout est flou.
Vous avez déclaré
qu'il y avait 3 tireurs.
Oui. lls avaient
des armes automatiques.
D'origine asiatique, je crois.
Si j'avais pu tirer
quelques coups de plus...
- Vous avez pu riposter ?
- Oui, mais c'était
trop tard. Jeff...
L'agent Edwards était touché.
On nous apprend
à contrôler nos émotions,
mais la vérité...
Je n'oublierai jamais
son visage
avant de mourir.
En parlant du loup...
Tanaka a tué une fois de trop.
Merci de votre aide.
Soignez votre épaule.
Le plan avance comme prévu.
Si les choses suivent leur cours,
le Centre touchera une grosse somme
dans 48 heures.
Je comprends la nature
délicate de cette opération
et je peux vous assurer
qu'elle réussira.
Ces vitres verticales derrière vous
s'appellent des portes.
Les gens polis frappent
avant de les ouvrir.
Pourquoi le Centre traite
avec des dealers et des assassins ?
Soyez plus précise.
Sammy Tanaka.
On n'a pas été informés
de l'enlèvement d'Emma Barrett.
- Connais pas.
- Vous mentez.
ll est dopé ?
On sait que vous avez détourné
la simulation 2578.
Vous n'avez pas chômé.
J'ai décidé d'étendre
le champ opérationnel du Centre.
Je n'en dirai pas plus.
Question de sécurité.
Jarod prendra ça
comme une attaque personnelle.
C'est une menace ?
Rendre Jarod complice
d'un meurtre et d'un enlèvement,
c'est risquer des représailles
dont vous n'avez pas idée.
J'en prends note.
lnutile de frapper pour sortir.
C'était assez affreux.
Te plains pas.
Tu as la petite.
Je n'avais pas le choix.
Comment tu as su
que j'avais joué
ta pension alimentaire
à Las Vegas ?
- Je le savais pas.
- Quelqu'un savait
et l'a dit au juge.
Tu as gagné grâce à Ca.
Personne n'a ''gagné''.
Tu savais que tu devais changer.
Ca m'est égal.
Ce qui m'énerve,
c'est Atlantic City.
Tu sais ce que coûte
le car jusqu'au New Jersey ?
Ne joue pas tout, pour une fois.
J'ai arrêté.
Quoi ?
Au cas où tu aurais faim.
Je dois y aller.
Sois sage.
Tout va bien se passer.
La perte d'un enfant.
Je n'imagine même pas.
Ca n'empêche pas
Tanaka de dormir.
ll est impitoyable
et sans scrupules.
D'après son dossier, il est lié
à une douzaine de meurtres
et n'a jamais été condamné.
Les hommes comme Tanaka
s'isolent de l'acte.
lls se contentent
d'appuyer sur un bouton.
Sauf quand Max et sa mère
sont sortis du magasin d'animaux.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Tanaka s'est énervé.
ll s'était fait doubler
par un dealer vietnamien. Erreur.
C'est pas très malin.
Tanaka porte des costumes
à 5 000 $ et roule en Royce,
mais il reste
un petit voyou de Tokyo.
ll a vu le type dehors
et a tiré.
Un garçon innocent est mort
en sortant au mauvais moment.
Emma Barrett est la seule
à avoir vu Tanaka tirer.
Vous la croyez morte ?
En tout cas, le FBl le croit.
lls ont rappelé
presque tous leurs agents.
- Pourquoi ?
- Perte de temps
et d'effectifs.
Elle était déjà morte
dans le fourgon.
Où est son corps ?
Pourquoi l'enlever
si le but était de la tuer ?
Ca fait 24 h.
On n'a aucune nouvelle.
Désolé.
Et une fois la victime isolée
par les forces amies ?
Tout dépend de la forme
des kidnappeurs.
Le mieux serait de la placer
à proximité de l'attaque initiale.
Combien de temps
doit-on la garder ?
24 heures.
Excusez-moi.
En retard pour quelque chose ?
J'espère que non.
La victime doit être placée
dans un bâtiment médiocre.
Avec une entrée dégagée
et un accès latéral.
Un hôtel modeste serait idéal.
Faites sortir Barrett.
On arrive.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Où m'emmenez-vous ?
Attendez !
Ecrase-le !
- Sydney.
- Emma Barrett est vivante.
Une équipe du Centre
est venue la prendre
dans un hôtel
près du lieu de l'enlèvement.
- Tu en es sûr ?
- lls l'ont mise dans un fourgon.
lls ont failli me tuer.
Je n'ai rien pu faire.
Je suis aussi choqué que toi.
Alors, aidez-moi.
Je dois savoir où le Centre
l'a emmenée.
Notre cher M. Lyle
ne desserre pas les dents.
Que vont-ils lui faire ?
Le Centre la gardera
jusqu'à ce qu'ils aient l'argent.
Ensuite, sa vie ne vaudra plus rien.
Je vous en prie, Sydney.
On a assez de sang sur les mains.
Excusez-moi de ne pas me lever.
Débarrassez-moi d'eux.
''Eux'' ?
Mlle Parker et Sydney.
lls posent des questions.
lls ont reçu des informations
qu'un seul homme pouvait connaîître.
Jarod.
Une équipe de nettoyeurs
l'a vu hier soir.
Sans vous vexer,
vous devriez peut-être
revoir le scénario Tanaka.
Je suppose que le Triumvirat
suit l'opération de près.
Ne me parlez pas du Triumvirat.
C'est moi qui contrôle la situation.
Barrett est dans un abri
du Centre.
Je vois le fils de Tanaka dans 2 h
pour clore le marché.
Je ne veux plus d'interférences.
Comptez sur mon dévouement
le plus loyal.
Posez ceci sur le bureau
de Mlle Parker.
L'information est en route.
J'espère qu'elle
ne posera pas de problème.
Comptez sur mon dévouement
le plus loyal.
1 3 mois à préparer un procès
de fond en comble
et le moment venu,
tout tombe à l'eau.
- Pourquoi ?
- Le juge me refuse un renvoi.
- On ne sait pas où est Barrett.
- Je cite :
''Ce n'est pas à la cour de produire
le témoin, mais au Parquet.
- Quand ?
- Le procès reprend demain à 1 0 h.
Sans le témoignage d'Emma Barrett,
un tueur d'enfant sera libre.
Je suis à court d'idées.
Tu aimes ta nouvelle maison ?
Elle est sympa, hein ?
Ca sent mauvais.
Le toast brûlé.
C'est parce que ça m'arrive
de brûler mon dîîner...
de temps en temps.
C'est à cause du four.
ll est un peu...
J'ai mis une balançoire
dans le jardin. Tu aimes ça ?
- Pourquoi pas ?
- Chérie...
Ecoute.
Fais attention.
Elle est mignonne.
J'ai frisé la syncope.
Je ne voulais pas être vu.
Apparemment,
vous avez obtenu sa garde.
Ecoutez...
Merci d'avoir dit que ma femme
était allée à Las Vegas.
Vous n'avez pas parlé au juge ?
Vous venez pour quoi ?
Aidez-moi à ouvrir
les fichiers de Lyle.
Vous êtes dingue ?
ll est fou !
ll y a une vie en jeu.
La mienne... Je viens
de ramener ma fille chez moi.
On lui fera quoi
si je me fais prendre ?
Désolé, mais je ne peux pas.
Félicitations pour votre fille.
Je suis désolé.
Bonjour, M. Broots.
Mon Dieu !
Un problème ?
J'ai oublié le numéro.
ll faut qu'on parle.
J'aimerais discuter
des détails de l'échange.
Désolé. L'interprète
devrait être ici depuis 5 mn.
Je n'ai pas l'habitude d'attendre,
M. Lyle.
ll demande comment
une organisation si puissante
peut être si mal dirigée.
Salut, Tommy.
Ca faisait un bail.
Vous vous connaissez ?
Tommy et moi
avons passé un long et chaud été
ensemble à la fac de Tokyo.
Tu n'as pas du tout changé, Parker.
Dis à ce charlot que je veux
régler l'échange de ce soir.
ll veut régler
l'échange de ce soir.
Une fois les 1 0 millions de $
virés sur le compte du Centre,
je veux récupérer le colis.
ll dit que les 1 0 millions
seront virés de son compte
à celui du Centre
et qu'il récupérera le colis.
Emma Barrett, je suppose ?
Dites-lui que je serai présent
en personne.
Notre abruti notoire
sera présent en personne.
Mon père a un dicton :
''Ne jamais se fier à un homme
''dont le nez est plus brun
que le Mont Fuji en été.''
Quoi ?
ll veut que j'assiste à l'échange.
Très bien.
Dites-lui que c'est d'accord.
Je crois qu'on a insulté sa virilité.
Qu'est-ce qui t'est arrivé ?
Mon père est très sévère
quand il n'a pas ce qu'il veut.
Sa main ?
Les yakusa sont punis
en se faisant couper le petit doigt.
ll a fait quoi
pour perdre un pouce ?
Bonne question.
A ce soir.
Vous savez à quel point
c'est dangereux pour moi ?
Et pour ma fille ?
Je crois que je connais le danger,
M. Broots.
J'ai presque envie
de vous demander un autographe.
Vous trouvez pas ça bizarre
d'être en tête-à-tête ?
Bizarre ?
Bizarre comme tout
ce qui est lié au Centre.
Je ne vois pas comment
vous pouvez être responsable
de ce qui est arrivé à Emma Barrett.
lls ont utilisé
une de mes simulations.
Et ils essaient de la vendre
à l'assassin de son fils.
Le Centre traite
avec des tueurs d'enfants ?
lls doivent la tenir
dans un abri du Centre.
Je dois consulter les fichiers
de M. Lyle pour savoir où.
J'ai déjà dit non à Sydney.
Sydney ?
ll vous a demandé de l'aide ?
Mais il y a un problème.
Lyle ne travaille pas sur ordinateur.
ll n'y croit pas.
C'est ce qui m'inquiète le plus.
ll faudrait entrer physiquement
dans son bureau.
Ne comptez pas sur moi
pour faire ça.
On a tous besoin d'aide, M. Broots.
Pour les choses qui comptent le plus.
Vous avez envoyé l'information
sur mon ex-femme.
Vous ferez un bon père.
Un enfant n'en demande pas plus.
C'est trop dangereux...
Voici Max.
ll avait le même âge que Debbie
quand on l'a tué
dans la rue, de sang-froid.
Aidez-moi.
L'air frais
fait du bien à ma peau.
Pourquoi m'avoir prévenue
que Lyle voyait Tommy Tanaka ?
Vous semblez fâchée.
Que voulez-vous ?
La même chose que vous.
La normalité.
Le retour au bon vieux temps.
Un code d'accès à 1 0 chiffres.
M. Lyle aura exactement le même,
à part le dernier chiffre.
Pendant le virement,
vous devrez entrer votre code
sans vous faire remarquer.
Vous allez voler Lyle ?
Non, Mlle Parker.
Vous allez le faire.
L'aigle s'est posé.
Tout est prêt, M. Lyle.
M. Tanaka va taper son code,
et vous entrerez le vôtre
pour recevoir l'argent.
Allons-y.
Pas l'abruti notoire.
Je te comprends.
Je doute aussi de ses compétences.
Parker, je préfère
que tu tapes le code.
Que se passe-t-il ?
M. Tanaka préfère
- qu'un autre tape le code.
- Qui ?
Allez-y.
Le virement est en cours.
Maintenant, je veux mon bien.
M. Tanaka réclame son bien.
Faites-la descendre.
Attendez.
L'argent entre
et ressort du compte.
A quoi vous jouez ?
- Qui a fait ça ?
- Jarod.
Jarod nous échappe !
Arrêtez-le !
N'y comptez pas
Dix millions de dollars.
Avec les fonds d'Omaha,
Jarod a pris près de 30 millions
de dollars au Centre.
Sans parler des 40 millions
de wall Street.
- Qu'il a rendus.
- Sans les intérêts.
Peu importe.
L'implication de Jarod
m'a mis dans une position
extrêmement délicate.
Je vous avais dit qu'il était
dangereux de le mêler à Ca.
ll n'a pas pu découvrir l'abri
sans aide de l'intérieur.
C'est une accusation ?
Jarod ne s'arrêtera
que quand justice sera faite.
Mobilisez tous les nettoyeurs.
Trouvez Barrett.
- Sinon ?
- Bouclez le secteur du tribunal.
Le procès Tanaka
reprend à 1 0 h du matin.
Jarod tentera d'amener Barrett.
J'ai promis au clan Tanaka
qu'il n'y arriverait pas.
Ce n'est pas le grand luxe,
mais je peux vous protéger.
Vous devriez manger.
Vous n'avez pas confiance.
Je comprends.
Si je vous voulais du mal,
je ne vous aurais pas délivrée.
Laissez-moi partir.
C'est trop risqué.
Je connais vos ravisseurs.
lls n'ont aucun scrupule.
- Sammy Tanaka.
- lls travaillaient pas pour lui.
lls allaient vous vendre à lui.
Vous ne le ferez pas ?
Vous n'en savez rien.
Mais lui, il sait.
Je me souviens de la fumée bleue
et d'un bruit de mitraillette.
Vous avez vu Edwards avant sa mort ?
Oui. C'était un brave homme.
ll avait des enfants, je crois.
Deux fils.
Vous avez de la famille ?
On m'a séparé de mes parents
quand j'étais tout petit.
Je les cherche.
Je vous souhaite de les trouver.
Combien de fois Gillson a tiré
avant d'être blessé ?
Tiré ?
ll a dit qu'il avait pu riposter.
Vous avez dû
mal comprendre.
ll n'a même pas dégainé.
Si j'avais pu tirer
quelques coups de plus...
- Vous avez pu riposter ?
- Oui, madame...
Je suis à bout, Jarod.
Comment ça ?
Depuis plus d'un an,
je vis dans des motels.
Je ne peux même pas
voir la tombe de Max.
Mon fils m'a quittée.
Rien ne changera ça.
Maintenant, un homme est mort
en voulant me protéger.
Un homme qui avait
une femme et deux enfants.
Je ne veux plus avoir de sang
sur les mains.
Et votre fils ?
Si vous ne vous battez pas,
si vous n'allez pas au procès
pour accuser Tanaka,
tout aura été vain.
C'est ce que vous voulez ?
Vous saviez que Jarod
serait présent lors de l'échange.
Je me disais la même chose de vous.
A d'autres.
Vous m'avez fait tourner
en bourrique.
J'en ai plus qu'assez.
ll s'agissait d'enfoncer Lyle,
n'est-ce pas ?
Le Triumvirat est las
du commandement de M. Lyle.
En traitant avec Sammy Tanaka,
il a exposé le Centre.
Vous n'avez pas imaginé ça
tout seul.
Qui est dans le coup ?
Moi.
Lâche-le.
S'il te plaîît.
Désolé pour les secrets,
mais il fallait que tu croies
exactement ce que tu as cru.
Et cette histoire de jeune lion
en faisait partie ?
- Pour ta sécurité.
- L'argent ?
Viré sur un autre compte du Centre.
Au moment voulu,
on impliquera M. Lyle
dans le vol de l'argent
et la disparition d'Emma Barrett.
Pourquoi tu ne m'as pas dit
la vérité ?
Je ne pensais pas
que tu me ferais confiance.
Si Sammy Tanaka
et ses timbrés pensent
que Lyle a volé leur argent
et leur témoin...
ll ne fera pas bon
être M. Lyle, n'est-ce pas ?
Je m'appelle Russell Gillson.
Je travaille
pour le Ministère de la Justice.
J'avais pour mission
de protéger Emma Barrett.
Des hommes armés ont assailli
le fourgon où nous étions,
Barrett, Jeffrey Edwards et moi.
J'ai dégainé mon arme
et tiré
plusieurs fois en riposte.
Tiré plusieurs fois en riposte.
Vous êtes mort, agent Gillson.
Mlle Barrett ?
Réveillez-vous.
On doit être au tribunal dans 2 h.
Emma, vous êtes réveillée ?
Comment m'avez-vous trouvée ?
Je viendrais ici,
si c'était mon enfant.
Max était un petit garçon rigolo,
mais timide et peureux.
ll y avait un gros chien
dans l'appartement à côté.
Quand Max rentrait de l'école,
ce chien se mettait à aboyer.
ll aboyait et grondait
de façon menaçante.
Alors, Max s'arrêtait
au bout de l'allée
et attendait que je l'escorte.
ll avait tellement peur.
J'ai donc décidé
de lui en offrir un à lui.
C'est ma faute
si on sortait du magasin d'animaux.
Vous ne pouviez pas savoir
ce qui arriverait.
Max vous aimait et vous l'aimiez.
Ne retenez que ça.
Le procès commence
dans moins de 2 h.
Vous croyez qu'ils me laisseront
entrer au tribunal ?
ll se trouve...
que oui.
Kevin ? C'est Jarod.
Le vendeur de glaces.
Tu me rendrais un service ?
Ca se présente bien
J'attendais plus de sécurité.
Le FBl doit penser
que Barrett est déjà morte.
ll a moins de 1 0 mn
pour l'amener à la barre.
Si on fermait les yeux, cette fois ?
ll s'agit du meurtre d'un enfant.
ll s'agit de Jarod.
Parker. Où on en est ?
Accès nord couvert.
Accès sud couvert.
Tout le monde sur ses gardes.
Jarod va bientôt...
Que faites-vous ici ?
On a entendu tirer...
Par là !
Enfoiré !
N'y comptez pas
ll est déjà dedans !
Dans l'affaire
Sammy Tanaka,
le Parquet a-t-il un témoin ?
Nous sollicitons un renvoi.
Motif ?
Le témoin de l'accusation
est indisponible pour l'instant.
Me Klein,
ce n'est pas la 1 re fois.
Demande de renvoi rejetée.
Avez-vous un témoin,
oui ou non ?
Votre Honneur... non.
Je demande l'autorisation
de présenter Emma Barrett
comme témoin de l'accusation.
Ravie de vous voir, Mlle Barrett.
Ravie d'être ici.
Après la pause,
le témoin prêtera serment.
Je vous remercie,
agent Gillson, de m'avoir aidé
à faire juger M. Tanaka.
Je ne l'aurais pas fait sans vous.
Ces personnes sont recherchées.
Arrêtez-les.
Le voilà.
Attrapez-le.
Vous plaisantez ?
Lâchez-moi.
lls ont eu Jarod ?
- Non.
- Zut ! On a un problème en moins.
J'ai laissé entendre au clan Tanaka
que M. Lyle n'était pas fiable.
On gagne sur tous les tableaux.
On se débarrasse de Lyle
et on récupère 1 0 millions.
Pas possible.
- Quoi ?
- Le compte est vide.
L'argent a disparu.
Dix millions de dollars.
Ca aidera beaucoup de gens.
Je n'y serais pas arrivé
sans votre aide.
Si vous n'aviez pas
transféré les fonds,
rien ne serait arrivé.
Merci.
Et profitez du cadeau.
Rentreras-tu un jour, Jarod ?
C'est trop tôt
pour vous le dire
Oui, monsieur.
Parfaitement.
Nous suivons la piste
de l'argent volé.
Je comprends.
Nous n'aurons plus de problème
avec Tanaka et ses hommes.
Oui, monsieur.

Croix du mérite.
Aviation. Je me trompe ?
C'était à mon père.
Son nom est là ?
J'ignore où il a combattu.
Je ne l'ai pas connu.
Tous ces noms...
Combien de pères
n'ont pas connu leurs enfants ?
Trop.
Vous savez que votre père
a été un héros
pour mériter ça.
Gardez-la précieusement,
comme son souvenir.
Vous avez connu mon père ?
Encore elle !
1 re classe Mark Clements,
compagnie Bravo.
Vous la connaissez ?
Elle vient ici depuis 1 0 ans
pour faire mettre
le nom de son père sur le mur.
Qui Nhon, en 71
et 72 ?
- Dans les rangers ?
- Désolé.
S'il est mort à la guerre,
son nom devrait y être !
Seuls les héros ont leur place ici.
On vous a prévenue.
Suivez-nous.
Attendez !
Le nom de mon père
devrait être là.
ll a sa place sur ce mur.
Je suis désolé.
Ce soir,
l'histoire tragique
d'une trahison au Vietnam,
par Jordan Brock.
Arrache-orteil,
on surnomme ainsi
les mines à pression.
On marche dessus,
on entend ''clic''.
On retire son pied
et on n'entend plus rien.
Les renseignements militaires
ont découvert que Mark Clements
vendait des informations
aux Viêt-Congs.
C'est ici, sur une de ces mines,
que la trahison de Clements
a pris fin.
Ayant trouvé
des documents secrets sur lui,
le Lt McClaren
en a été témoin.
Mark Clements
était comme un frère.
J'aurais donné ma vie pour lui.
Mais c'était un traître.
Pourquoi a-t-il changé de camp ?
ll nous a tous déçus.
Ce gamin est la mascotte de l'unité.
ll vit à la base et a tout vu.
Mark rencontrer Viêt-Congs.
J'entends clic.
J'entends explosion.
Mark était mon ami.
Je vois Mark mourir.
C'était Jordan Brock.
Ouvrez l'oeil !
Vous l'avez vu ?
ll estpar là.
Continuez !
Près des arbres !
Padia ?
Je l'ai.
Où êtes-vous ?
Vous êtes où, bon sang ?
Vous avez perdu ça.
Bravo.
Où avez-vous appris le camouflage ?
Je sais me fondre dans le paysage.
Formidable !
J'ai visionné la vidéo.
Ces caméras pour casque,
- comment vous appelez ça ?
- Des caméras aniscopiques.
L'équivalent de CNN
pour Tempête du Désert.
On se prendra tous pour Rambo.
- Qui ?
- Marrant !
Si ces caméras marchent bien,
le Capitole fera tout
pour vous aider.
C'est le but.
ll me faut
des analyses comparatives
pour le député Stanfield,
chargé du financement.
Fouine
de bureaucrate !
Jarod Patton.
Adjudant Hancock
et sergent-chef Padia.
Attention,
elle est féroce comme un pit-bull.
Bienvenue dans l'opération
''Coup de balai''.
Une mission avec la Colombie
pour éliminer
la fabrication de narcotiques.
Une grosse quantité de coke
est en route
vers une fabrique de Cartagena
- appartenant à...
- Esteban Largo.
Portez votre bip 24 h sur 24.
Papa ?
- Je suis censée être ici ?
- Bien sûr.
On va bien s'amuser.
Regarde.
Assieds-toi.
Tu as ta Barbie.
C'est sympa, non ?
Tu peux dessiner.
ll suffit que tu restes là
et que tu sois très sage
jusqu'à ce qu'on rentre.
Et après, on s'amusera bien.
Pas sûr.
On fait aussi garderie ?
La nounou a la rougeole.
Je n'avais pas le choix.
Regardez dans les Pages Jaunes
à B, comme baby-sitter.
Pas question de laisser
ma fille à une inconnue.
Désolé,
mais elle reste ici avec moi.
Si vous êtes d'accord.
Assurez-vous que la mioche
ne m'approche pas.
M. Raines.
J'adore Miami.
Tout de suite.
Jarod a piraté
la base de données de Miami.
M. Raines veut que j'aille
faire un inventaire.
Vous pourriez me dépanner
pour Debbie ?
Désolé, je supervise des jumeaux
pour une expérience sur le sommeil.
N'y songez même pas.
C'est l'affaire d'un jour,
deux au maximum.
Je ne joue pas à la maman.
Je ne sais pas.
Ca pourrait régler
des problèmes liés à votre enfance.
Ca ne finit jamais avec vous !
Vous me revaudrez ça.
Et comment !
Merci.
De la gelée ?
- C'est un dessert ?
- Comme à la cantine !
On m'apportait toujours
mes repas.
Vous vous nourrissiez seul ?
En général.
Si la gélatine est molle,
l'ananas reste au fond.
Si elle est trop dure,
les morceaux restent dessus.
ll faut attendre
la viscosité adéquate
pour ajouter les morceaux.
C'est le capitaine ?
Oui, au Vietnam.
Son heure de gloire.
Ce qui me manque le plus ?
Mes cheveux.
Compagnie Bravo.
Qui Nhon.
Vous voyez toujours les hommes ?
Celui qui vit encore :
Barney Stanfield.
Le député.
Ce bidasse était sous mes ordres !
J'ai rédigé le rapport comparatif
sur les caméras
que l'assistant de M. Stanfield
voulait.
J'ai comparé
des fabricants
japonais et américains.
Vos conclusions ?
Achetez américain.
Padia !
Apportez ça au Capitole.
Vous permettez ?
Je voudrais remettre ça au député.
Je n'ai jamais approché
le pouvoir de si près.
Que ce soit bien clair.
ll y a des règles ici.
On ne court pas, on ne joue pas,
on ne met pas les pieds
sur les meubles.
Pas de bruit, ce qui inclut
les pleurs et les jérémiades.
Sois invisible
et on s'entendra bien.
Vos habits sont jolis.
Ne touche pas mes affaires.
Surtout mes vêtements.
Quoi ?
Attendez.
- Que fais-tu ?
- Rien !
Je t'ai dit de ne toucher à rien !
M. Stanfield, le rapport
du capitaine McClaren.
- Comment va ce vétéran ?
- Toujours chauve !
Ce type me plaîît.
Député Leon Beckwith,
de Louisiane.
Vous avez présidé un comité
sur le Vietnam.
- Vous êtes électeur ?
- Non, monsieur.
Mais j'ai participé
à la victoire de Nixon en 72.
ll me plaîît !
- Enchanté.
- Moi de même.
J'espère que vous aimez les cigares.
- Santiago Caribe.
- Réserve personnelle.
ll faut des relations
pour en trouver.
Denise Clements est encore là.
Faites-la entrer.
Un problème ?
Une tragédie !
Qui ne s'effacera pas, hélas.
Restez, je vous prie.
Désolée de vous déranger.
J'ai deux filles.
J'espère être aussi aimé
que votre père.
Asseyez-vous.
J'ai parlé au caporal Ethington
qui a connu un certain Duke.
Dans une lettre,
mon père évoque un dénommé Duke
qui l'aidait à attraper un traîître.
Pas à agir comme tel.
Si c'est le même Duke,
il lavera le nom de mon père.
On a souvent parlé de cette lettre.
C'est une preuve indirecte,
quoi que ce Duke ait à dire.
S'il vient à la prochaine réunion,
je l'écouterai.
Merci.
Son père était dans votre compagnie.
Mark Clements est le dernier homme
qu'on aurait imaginé en traîître.
Elle ne renonce pas
à ses convictions.
Quelqu'un a dit :
''Un vieux soldat ne meurt jamais,
''il s'efface simplement
peu à peu.''
On ne peut pas en dire autant
de son souvenir.
Je crois qu'il se renforce.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Quelqu'un qui ne prend pas
votre père pour un traîître.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Ca doit être dur pour vous.
C'est toute ma vie.
Après la mort de ma mère,
j'ai compris
combien il était important
qu'il ait son nom là-haut.
Renoncer reviendrait
à accepter sa culpabilité.
C'est la dernière lettre de mon père,
ça remonte à 72.
''Duke a découvert
qu'un des hommes vend
''des secrets à l'ennemi.
''Si j'apprends qui c'est,
je le plains.''
Le vrai traîître aurait découvert
que votre père l'avait identifié
et l'aurait piégé.
Personne ne me croit.
Moi, je vous crois.
Dis-moi ce qui ne va pas
sur ces dessins.
ll manque la cheminée.
La porte est à l'envers.
ll manque un poteau.
Et les chiffres
sont inversés.
Regarde de plus près.
L'ombre de la pile de bois.
Elle est faussée.
Ca m'a échappé.
C'est le cas
de la plupart des gens.
Leurs yeux ne voient que
l'évidence.
Mais pour optimiser ton don,
tes yeux
doivent tout voir.
Mark était mon ami.
Je vois Mark mourir.
Le Xuan Duc.
Salut, Duke.
Comment ça,
ça sera plus long que prévu ?
Je fais de mon mieux.
Tu permets ?
- Et Debbie ?
- Ca va.
Vous devriez vous inquiéter pour moi.
Je reviens dès que possible.
Maman, apprends-moi à me coiffer.
Tu l'as reçu ?
On l'ouvrira après l'école.
Vous avez de beaux cheveux.
- Vous pouvez me coiffer ?
- Je n'ai pas le temps.
Pourquoi êtes-vous si méchante ?
Je suis née comme ça.
C'est pas vrai.
Vous voulez être riche ?
Bien sûr !
Je suis là pour vous y aider !
Avec ma nouvelle vidéo,
Comment devenir vite riche !
Mon nom Lenny Duc. Je viens
ici dans tout petit bateau
et maintenant, j'ai gros bateau !
Rêve américain,
numéro un !
Coupez ! Parfait, Lenny.
Pause déjeuner !
J'ai réservé une table
au restaurant, vous venez ?
Je ne pense pas.
Excusez-moi.
M. Duc ?
Je suis un de vos fans.
99,95 $ plus les frais de port
et le rêve est à vous.
Et quel rêve !
Un jeune Vietnamien
qui arrive ici sans rien
et qui construit cet empire.
Vous me rappelez un petit garçon
vu aux actualités
qui parlait d'un G.l.,
mort en traîître, soi-disant.
Comment il s'appelait ? Ah, oui.
Mark Clements...
Je ne comprends pas.
Revenez à la base
Désolé de vous avoir dérangé.
Bonne journée.
Opération ''Coup de balai'',
la cible est à 2 h.
Bonne chance.
lls ne se doutent pas
qu'on est là.
lls vont s'en apercevoir.
Coup de balai
Esteban Largo a dû être furieux.
Bien joué, lieutenant.
Fier d'avoir participé.
Vous aimez les cigares ?
C'est un Santiago Caribe.
Merci.
Je vais passer à la télé.
ll ne m'a jamais offert de cigare,
alors que j'aime ça.
- Que faites-vous ?
- Vous ne remarquez rien ?
Le C-4 a du répondant !
Regardez les débris.
ll n'y avait rien dedans.
ll y a des bidons,
de la poudre brûlée,
du matériel de labo.
Assez pour traiter
cent tonnes de coke ?
Quoi ?
Quelqu'un a prévenu Largo
de notre arrivée.
ll enlève tout
et laisse juste assez de preuves
pour que ça soit crédible.
Qui ferait ça ?
Avec la destruction
de cette fabrique de cocaïne,
la lutte contre la drogue avance.
Voici le capitaine McClaren,
cerveau de l'opération.
Santiago Caribe.
Réserve personnelle.
ll faut des relations
pour en trouver.
lls ont vraiment des relations.
Bien, continuons. Suivant !
1 re classe Mark Clements.
Mlle Clements,
vous avez du nouveau
- à ce sujet ?
- En effet.
Un caporal
de la 1 85e division...
Vous disiez ?
ll s'agit de Duke,
mentionné par mon père.
Ce Duke est là pour témoigner ?
Je ne l'ai pas trouvé.
Mais mon père n'était pas un traîître.
Vous pourriez écouter ?
Avez-vous du nouveau
à ce sujet ?
Non, mais si vous me laissiez
un peu de temps...
Désolé.
Ecoutez-moi !
Suivant !
Pourquoi vous n'écoutez pas ?
Je suis au regret de vous dire ceci,
mais pour être direct,
votre père n'aura jamais
son nom sur ce mur.
Nous avons d'autres affaires
à régler.
Vous abandonnez ?
Je vois la réalité en face.
Peut-être que je ne trouve pas
Duke parce qu'il n'existe pas.
Peut-être
que je ne trouve aucune preuve
pour défendre mon père
parce qu'il n'y en a pas.
Peut-être qu'il n'y en a pas
parce que mon père était...
Enfant,
on m'a enlevé à ma famille.
Je ne sais pas qui ils sont.
Ni qui est mon père.
Je n'ai que ça.
C'est tout ce qui me rattache à lui.
Jamais je ne renoncerai
à le chercher
ou à chercher ma famille.
Ne renoncez pas à votre famille.
Je n'ai plus la force
de continuer toute seule.
Vous n'êtes pas seule.
lls sont éveillés
depuis plus de 90 h.
En votre compagnie, c'est un record.
Débarrassez-moi de cette gamine.
Faites-lui faire une simu.
- Ca n'est qu'une enfant.
- Elle n'écoute pas !
Elle fouille partout.
Je l'ai toujours dans les pattes.
Un vrai chihuahua !
Elle a trouvé
le cadeau de votre mère.
Broots a appelé.
ll s'inquiète
pour le bien-être de sa fille.
ll est temps
qu'il s'inquiète pour le mien.
Elle fait exprès de m'énerver.
Debbie n'essaie pas de vous énerver,
mais d'être comme vous.
Elle sent inconsciemment
que vous partagez une similarité
quant à l'abandon maternel.
Vous êtes capable d'avoir
une conversation normale ?
C'est un mécanisme adaptatif
d'imitation.
Elle sent la façon
dont vous en êtes sortie
et espère pouvoir aussi
s'en sortir un jour.
ll faut donc laisser
cette relation s'épanouir.
Ca me ferait plaisir si,
pour une fois,
vous étiez dans mon camp.
ll ne s'agit pas de camp,
mais de l'intérêt de l'enfant.
En projetant votre colère
sur Debbie,
vous déplacez la colère
contre l'enfant que vous étiez.
Et pourquoi je suis en colère,
Dr Spock ?
Vous vous reprochez
la mort de votre mère.
Laissez-moi !
Ca n'est qu'une copie de travail.
Vous voulez avoir
grande maison, grosse voiture ?
Belles filles ?
Bien sûr que oui !
Je vois Mark mourir.
Mark était mon ami.
Que se passe-t-il ?
- lncident technique.
- Vous êtes qui ?
Quelqu'un qui cherche la vérité.
Pourquoi avoir corroboré
son histoire ?
- McClaren vous a menacé ?
- Vous ne savez rien.
Stanfield et lui tuyautent
un gros bonnet de la drogue.
Et ça ne date pas d'aujourd'hui.
- Vous ne vous rendez pas compte.
- Je comprends.
Vous n'étiez qu'un enfant.
McClaren offre
de vous libérer de la guerre.
Vous appuyez son histoire
à la télé
et il vous met
sur un bateau pour les USA.
C'était... un avion.
McClaren a mis ma famille
dans un avion.
Je dis bateau dans la pub
pour faire vendre.
La guerre est finie.
Elle doit finir
pour Denise Clements.
Je nettoyais
la tente de McClaren
et j'ai vu des documents secrets.
J'en ai parlé à Mark.
ll voulait prendre McClaren
en flagrant délit
avant de l'accuser de trahison.
Ce soir-là, on a suivi
McClaren dans une clairière
- au nord du camp.
- C'était un piège.
McClaren se savait démasqué
par Clements
et voulait qu'il le suive.
ll avait posé des mines.
Clements a entendu le clic
en marchant sur l'arrache-orteil ?
Oui, il l'a entendu.
Mais il n'a pas marché dessus.
Vous ?
Mark a transféré
son poids pour que je puisse
me dégager.
- ll a pris votre place.
- Et McClaren est arrivé.
ll savait que Clements
ne bougerait pas.
Alors, il a tiré.
ll n'est pas mort sur le coup.
McClaren l'a regardé
se vider de son sang.
ll a mis les documents secrets
sur lui,
faisant passer Clements
pour un traîître.
J'entends encore ce clic.
Je sens le feu de l'explosion.
Vous croyez la guerre finie ?
Elle ne sera jamais finie pour moi.
Excusez-moi.
Ca vient du bureau de M. Stanfield.
Rendez-vous
au terrain d'entraînement
Tout va bien ?
Tout va bien ?
Oui, ça va.
Pardon.
Je peux revenir plus tard.
Entre.
Vous êtes sûre ?
Assieds-toi.
Et si je te coiffais ?
Désolée de m'être mise
en colère tout à l'heure.
Mais ce cadeau m'a été offert
par ma mère et...
personne d'autre que moi
n'y a touché depuis longtemps.
Pourquoi ne pas l'avoir ouvert ?
Je ne sais pas trop.
J'ai voulu le faire
un millier de fois.
Mais...
c'était tellement parfait...
Le papier qu'elle avait choisi
et la façon de nouer le ruban,
c'était tellement ma mère.
Votre maman est morte, hein ?
Le jour où elle m'a offert
ce cadeau.
Je ne l'aurais pas ouvert non plus.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que si vous l'aviez fait,
votre maman n'aurait plus rien eu
à vous offrir.
Je crois qu'il est temps.
Ma mère adorait ce livre.
Elle voulait le lire avec moi.
Les Quatre filles du Dr March.
De quoi ça parle ?
D'une petite fille du nom de Jo.
Elle était heureuse ?
On va voir.
''Chapitre premier
Jouer au pèlerin
''Noël ne sera pas Noël
sans cadeaux, marmonna Jo.
''C'est si affreux d'être pauvre,
soupira Meg.
''C'est injuste que certaines
''aientplein de choses
et d'autres, rien !,
''ajouta Amy en reniflant.
''On a papa, maman et nous,
''dit Beth dans son coin.
''Les quatrejeunes visages... ''
''Jo dit tristement :
''On n'a pas de père
''et on n'en aura pas
pendant longtemps.
''Elle ne dit pas jamais,
''mais toutes pensèrent à leur père,
''loin, sur le front...''
Barney ?
Voilà un bruit désagréable.
Jarod, Dieu merci !
Je suis content de vous voir.
Ca ne va pas ?
Je suis sur une mine !
Je vais chercher de l'aide.
Combien de temps tiendrez-vous ?
Le temps qu'il faudra.
Comme toute personne sachant
ce qui l'attend si elle bouge.
C'est pour Ca que vous avez dû
tirer sur Mark Clements.
Je vais donc vous tirer dessus.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Que s'est-il passé à Qui Nhon ?
A votre place, je parlerais.
La prochaine balle
ne sera pas à blanc.
Les renseignements
avaient trouvé un traîître.
Vous avez fait porter
le chapeau à Clements.
Stanfield et vous,
vous étiez blanchis.
On a fait ce qu'il fallait.
Vous vendiez des secrets
au plus offrant.
Dites-moi une chose.
La cupidité
peut faire tuer un innocent ?
Le tuer ne suffisait pas.
ll fallait le détruire.
Vous lui avez volé son honneur.
Vous avez laissé sa fille
livrer un autre combat.
Votre parole contre la mienne.
Vous croyez que quelqu'un
doutera de moi ?
Grâce à la caméra,
c'est aussi votre parole.
Désamorcez cette mine, lieutenant !
Je suis votre supérieur !
Techniquement, non. Je ne suis
pas vraiment dans l'armée.
Mais si ça vous rassure,
je ne vous tirerai pas dans la jambe.
Je viserai...
plus haut.
Ne mouillez pas votre pantalon.
C'est de la gelée, un dessert.
Miam-miam.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
On a fait des courses.
Ca vous pose un problème ?
Chérie ?
Prends tes affaires,
on va laisser Mlle Parker travailler.
Elle est formidable.
Prenez toujours soin d'elle.
Ou je vous traquerai
et vous tuerai. Compris ?
Je crois que oui.
Lis-le en entier. C'est promis ?
Promis.
Viens, ma puce.

Sydney, vous Ítes censť dire
la chute... maintenant.
J'ai le rapport, Gibbs.
47 containers,
presque un record.
Regardez.
Vous Ítes marrant, Strickland.
Piťgťe !
Un peu de respect, d'accord ?
Des gens sont morts ici !
Du calme.
C'ťtaient aussi mes amis.
Larry m'a appris ce tour.
ll aurait ri !
Vous mangez Áa ?
C'est trŤs bon.
De la nourriture cťleste.
Dupont ?
C'est moi.
M.l.T., Exxon Valdez, KoweÔt.
B‚tir un tel C.V. prend du temps.
Je l'ai tapť en quatre minutes.
TrŤs drŰle !
Curt wilks, relations publiques.
Enchantť.
Je voulais prťciser
qu'aucun employť
ne devait parler ŗ la presse
de l'accident de MZT.
lls se dťlectent
de cette tentative de suicide.
Comment Áa a pu se passer ?
Dan parlera
en reprenant connaissance.
N'aggravez pas son cas. Compris ?
Aggraver son cas ?
ll peut parler !
C'est mauvais signe.
Passez le Centre au peigne fin.
Chaque niveau souterrain.
Si Sydney est parti,
je veux sa feuille de sortie.
Sam, soyez discret.
C'est vraiment dingue.
On est au Centre, Broots.
Les gens ont tendance
ŗ disparaÓÓtre.
Comme M. Lyle.
- Sydney a dťjŗ ťtť comme Áa ?
- Une fois.
A quelle occasion ?
C'ťtait personnel.
J'espŤre qu'il va bien.
Vous croyez qu'il va bien ?
A votre avis ?
A l'aide ! Au secours !
Larry ! Aidez-moi !
Vous les avez vus mourir ?
Je n'ai jamais rien vu de pareil.
lls chargeaient le container
dans le camion.
Le premier a explosť.
lls n'avaient pas de protection ?
Pour Hunsaker,
c'ťtait sans problŤme.
Mais en 20 secondes, le MZT
les a rťduits en bouillie.
J'ai donnť l'alarme,
je suis venue avec Strickland,
mais ŗ notre arrivťe,
Áa les avait dťjŗ rongťs.
lls n'avaient aucune chance.
Dan a travaillť 3 ans lŗ-dessus.
ll avait testť Áa plusieurs fois.
Pas contre le MZT.
Ca n'a pas de sens.
Vous le dťfendez contre wilkes !
ll ne pense
qu'ŗ l'image de la sociťtť.
Dan ťtait effondrť.
ll a fait son boulot.
- ll faut qu'il te voie.
- Je peux pas.
Todd, je t'en prie.
Pas question que j'y aille !
Excusez-moi.
Je la lui ai rťparťe.
Vous ťtiez ŗ l'arrÍt de bus.
Vous avez aidť Dan.
Je n'ai pas pu vous remercier.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
- Susan.
- Bonjour, Susan.
Comment va-t-il ?
Les mťdecins ne savent pas trop.
ll risque de...
C'est votre fils ?
Todd, c'est Áa ?
Dan a parlť de lui.
ll refuse de voir son pŤre.
Je vous ennuie
avec nos problŤmes.
Ca vous change des journalistes.
Tous les jours,
ces vautours demandent
si son pŤre a tuť ces gens.
ll commence ŗ le croire.
C'est une trŤs mauvaise idťe.
M. Raines risque
de poser des questions.
Fester ne saura jamais
que Lurch a disparu.
ll va ťprouver
ce qu'ťprouvait Sydney ?
C'est clair ?
Jarod a dessinť Áa. Qui est-ce ?
Qui est-ce ?
Celui qui apporte la mort.
Nous arrivons
sur les lieux de l'accident.
Le camion-citerne contient
du triptochloronol.
- Regardez les ťmanations !
- Une fuite !
On va tenter de dťpressuriser.
Les secours arrivent ?
La pression
augmente rapidement.
Ca va sauter
si on se dťpÍche pas.
La pression ?
Dťjŗ ŗ 4 000.
Vite, Hunsaker !
- Ca va ?
- Maman est lŗ-dedans !
Laissez faire les infirmiers.
Je vais l'aider.
Eloignez-le.
4 750 et Áa monte encore !
Serrez, Hunsaker !
Vous m'entendez ?
Ca va aller.
Je vais vous aider.
Vous Ítes suicidaire ?
Remettez Áa, Dupont.
Les ťmanations vont la tuer.
Si Áa explose,
on sera tous balayťs !
5 800 ! DťpÍchez-vous !
Votre fils va bien.
Respirez.
Ca risque de faire dťsordre !
6 300. Ca baisse !
J'adore ce boulot !
Un de nos expťditeurs ?
Un opticien
de l'Etat de New York.
ll s'appelle Martin Zeller.
ll a un petit cabinet.
ll a fait
253 ordonnances l'an dernier
et offre des sucettes au citron.
Sydney a peur
du grand mťchant loup ?
Juste avant que la photo
soit prise, il ťtait
dans cet ascenseur.
L'ascenseur de la tour.
C'est sŻrement un client.
Le dessin de Jarod.
ll a disparu.
- Bonjour, Todd.
- Pas de commentaire.
- Je ne suis pas journaliste.
- Que voulez-vous ?
Je pense
que votre pŤre est innocent.
C'est pour Áa qu'il s'est jetť
sous un bus ? Laissez-moi !
J'ťtais ŗ l'arrÍt avec lui.
Vous lui avez sauvť la vie ?
J'aurais aimť Ítre plus rapide.
Mon pŤre se moquait de sa vie.
Ne vous en mÍlez pas !
Rien.
- C'est quoi ?
- Du MZT.
Vous Ítes fou ?
Du calme. Le joint de Dan tient.
Vraiment ?
Ca tient depuis... 5 heures.
Dan n'est pour rien
dans l'accident.
ll n'a pas tuť Larry.
Si Áa n'est pas lui,
alors qui ?
Vous avez un message.
C'est lui ?
Non, les yeux ne vontpas.
lmagine que tu fais
un portrait-robotpour la police.
Savoir qui c'est m'aiderait.
C'est votre pŤre ?
Non.
Lŗ,
au milieu du sourcil droit,
une imperfection.
C'est Áa.
Ses yeux...
Vous pleurez ?
Bien sŻr que non.
Cet homme vous a fait du mal ?
Sydney a des ennuis.
Comment tu sais
tout ce qui se passe ici ?
L'intuition.
On a vu ton dessin
de Martin Zeller.
- Qui est-ce ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Mais je me souviens de Sydney
pendant la simulation.
Qui est-ce ?
C'est ŗ Sydney de le dire.
Trouve oý le Centre loge Zeller.
Sydney y sera.
C'est encore une de tes marottes ?
Si tu tiens ŗ Sydney,
vas-y seule.
Pas de nettoyeurs.
Pourvu que tu arrives ŗ temps.
A temps pour quoi ?
Pour l'arrÍter.
J'ai faim. J'attends depuis
20 minutes. Vous Ítes en retard !
Exact.
Je suis trŤs en retard.
Vous ne vous souvenez pas de moi.
On ťtait si nombreux
que vous avez oubliť nos noms.
Je ne sais pas de quoi
vous parlez. Vous Ítes fou.
Vous devriez entendre chaque nom.
Mais le temps presse.
A mon ‚ge,
le temps ne signifie rien.
Peut-Ítre que Ca, oui.
Allez-y, si vous voulez.
Franchement,
j'en ai marre de me cacher.
C'est trop facile.
Vous allez m'ťcouter.
Oui ? Et aprŤs ?
AprŤs... je vous tuerai.
Qui a gagnť ?
L‚chez-moi !
Vous dťfendiez le pŤre
dont vous dites vous moquer.
Un sportif de haut niveau.
ll est fier de vous.
- ll me l'a dit.
- Quand ?
Avant d'essayer de se tuer ?
ll ne pensait qu'ŗ vous
et votre mŤre.
En se tuant,
il pensait faire cesser
les questions.
Je ne dis pas que c'est bien,
mais c'est ce qu'il ťprouvait.
Un insecte de mťtal et de fil.
Un app‚t pour la pÍche.
Une sorte de leurre.
C'ťtait le passe-temps de papa.
Celui-ci me porte chance.
Avec lui, Áa mord toujours.
J'ai vu une photo
oý vous pÍchez ensemble.
Ca a l'air sympa.
Vous pÍchiez avec votre pŤre ?
Hťlas, je ne l'ai pas connu.
Vous connaissez le vŰtre.
Profitez-en.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
La veille du jour...
oý il ťtait ŗ l'arrÍt de bus
avec vous,
on s'est disputťs
et j'ai dit des bÍtises.
Je lui ai dit qu'il ťtait
responsable de l'accident.
Quoi d'autre ?
J'ai dit
qu'il ne mťritait pas de vivre.
Je ne veux pas qu'il meure.
Je ne veux pas !

Des collŤgues en deuil

- Jarod !
- Je voulais vous aider.
Je vous ai mÍme apportť du cafť.
Pas si vite, petit gťnie.
- Moi aussi, je connais la chimie.
- Pas mal.
Pourquoi
quelqu'un d'aussi qualifiť
s'occupe toujours du transport ?
- Votre salaire pourrait doubler.
- Et mes migraines aussi.
ArrÍtez-vous. Je dois voir Ca.
Piťgť !
On dirait presque
un accident, non ?
Ce sont des bons de sortie.
Vous avez signť
pour 52 containers.
Seulement 42
ont ťtť enterrťs dans le Nevada.
Et les autres ?
Horace Strickland les a livrťs
ŗ des trafiquants de drogue.
ll est fichť par le FBl.
HťroÔne.
ll utilisait les containers
pour son trafic.
Qui inspecterait
un container dangereux ?
Strickland avait
un joli compte en banque.
Moins ses versements
ŗ Larry Meyers.
Meyers ťtait dans le coup ?
ll menaÁait Strickland
de rťvťler le trafic.
Le jour de l'accident,
Strickland a percť
la cargaison de MZT
pour que Áa ronge
le joint de Dan
et Larry Meyers.
C'est lui.
Qui est-ce ?
J'ai reÁu un paquet d'affaires
appartenant ŗ ma famille.
Elles avaient disparu
depuis longtemps.
C'est une photo
de mon frŤre Jacob et moi.
Notre premiŤre communion.
C'est votrejumeau ?
Jacob est ma seule famille.
J'aimerais avoir une famille.
Jean MikhaÔl vivait avec
sa famille dans une ferme
prŤs de Lyon.
ll ne travaillait
que pour aider sa femme, Greta,
et ses deux fils.
Des jumeaux.
Sydney !
Vous vous rappelez.
Jacob ťtait votre frŤre.
TrŤs bien, Herr Doktor.
Et c'est la seule famille
qui me reste.
Les autres...
vous les avez assassinťs
car ils ne vous servaient ŗ rien.
Qui Ítes-vous pour en dťcider ?
Qui ?
Ca, c'est pour Jean MikhaÔl.
Et Áa, c'est pour Greta.
Mon Dieu !
- Qui est M. Zeller ?
- ll n'y a pas de Zeller.
C'est le Dr werner Krieg.
Le jeune mťdecin
ambitieux nommť ŗ Dachau
en 1 944.
Les nazis faisaient
des expťriences sur nous.
lls cherchaient des moyens
d'accťlťrer la reproduction
de la race supťrieure.
Jacob et moi, on est devenus
les cobayes prťfťrťs de Krieg.
Nous n'ťtions que des enfants.
ll a envoyť notre famille
ŗ la chambre ŗ gaz
pour pouvoir faire
des expťriences sur nous.
Vous n'Ítes pas juif, Sydney.
J'ai un jumeau.
Strickland ? ll faut transporter
un chargement ce soir.
Si vous avez besoin de moi...
Bien sŻr,
vous prťfťrez Ítre seul.
Vous m'avez fichu la trouille !
ll y a une caisse de plus.
C'est du MZT.
Je n'ai pas de combinaison.
Larry Meyers et les autres
non plus.
- Pas vrai ?
- C'est pas drŰle !
Etre tuť par le MZT non plus.
Pas vrai ?
Piťgť !
- Je peux pas bouger !
- Dťtendez-vous.
Vous y Ítes
pour les 20 000 ans ŗ venir.
C'est du MZT !
Le pesticide le plus toxique
au monde.
Ca vous transforme en gelťe.
Mais Áa n'attaquera pas
le joint de Healy.
- N'est-ce pas ?
- C'est dťjŗ arrivť !
Bien sŻr.
Parce que vous y avez ajoutť Áa...
pour vous dťbarrasser
de Larry Meyers
- et continuer votre trafic.
- J'ai rien fait !
Vous avez tuť trois personnes
et fait accuser Dan Healy.
ll pensait que pour protťger
sa famille,
il fallait qu'il disparaisse.
Vous avez dťtruit sa vie.
Pas vrai ?
Oui, mais ne me faites pas Áa !
Pourquoi pas ?
C'est ce que vous leur avez fait.
CrŤme fouettťe.
La nourriture cťleste.
Vous connaissez Nietzsche,
docteur ?
Vous Ítes comme le fou qui court
en appelant Dieu.
Vous ne le trouverez pas,
Dieu est mort.
Dieu est mort
et vous l'avez tuť.
Nous sommes des professionnels.
Je sais pour qui vous travaillez.
Je sais ce qu'ils font,
ce que vous faites.
Que vous serait-il arrivť,
ŗ Jacob et vous,
si je ne vous avais pas choisis ?
Seriez-vous ici,
si plein de dťtermination ?
Si Dieu est mort,
on l'a tous tuť.
Vous vous rappelez le jour...
oý ma mŤre a ťtť enterrťe ?
Je n'oublierai jamais ce jour-lŗ.
Vous m'avez rťconfortťe.
Plus que mon propre pŤre.
Et vous avez seulement...
pris ma main.
Donnez-moi votre arme.
C'est un monstre.
Rendez un service au monde
et ŗ vous-mÍme.
Je ne peux pas.
Pourquoi ?
Jarod.
Vous ne voyez pas ?
Je suis devenu le monstre.
La fuite fatale
s'avŤre Ítre un meurtre
Vous savez, ŗ l'arrÍt de bus...
Je comprends maintenant
que j'ai mal agi
pour de mauvaises raisons.
Le plus important,
c'est que vous soyez lŗ.
Quelqu'un a dit : ''Rien
ne compte plus que la famille.''
Papa ?
Je t'aime.
Ca vous portera bonheur.
Merci.
Merci ŗ vous.
Bonne chance, gourmand.
J'aimerais avoir une famille.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Ca date de la guerre.
Vous ťtiez
en camp de concentration ?
J'ai ťtť enfermť
dans un endroit sombre et froid
pendant des annťes.
Comme le Centre ?
Pas tout ŗ fait.
On vous a fait mal ?
Pas autant qu'ŗ ma famille.
lls les ont tous tuťs.
Je serai votre famille.
Je viens de l'apprendre.
Krieg a ťtť extradť vers lsraŽl.
Ca vient d'arriver.
Merci.
Combien de psys faut-il
pour changer une ampoule ?
Un.
Mais il faut que l'ampoule
veuille changer.
- Ca va ?
- Oui.
Toute ma vie,
je lui en ai voulu.
Mais en le revoyant,
je me suis vu.
Vous n'Ítes pas un monstre.
Et vous Ítes toujours...
ma famille.
Dites-moi une chose.
Vous Ítes dťjŗ allť ŗ la pÍche ?
Pourquoi ?
Peut-Ítre qu'un jour on ira.
Rien que vous et moi.
Adaptation
Odile Manforti
Sous-titrage
NlCE FELLOw
Je comprends
que tu sois sous pression.
Papa ?
Tu as été patient
pour ce qui est de Jarod, mais...
Plus de prétextes. Je...
n'avais pas fini.
Je pensais
que vous vouliez me tuer.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Je m'appelle lgor.
Laissez-moi, Frankenstein.
Superbe.
La combustion spontanée
n'est pas un mythe.
Je n'ai jamais d'allumettes
sur moi.
Regardez.
Concentrez-vous.
ll doit y avoir
un lien entre ça
et ce film de Frankenstein.
Vous connaissez les dialogues ?
Quelque chose comme :
''- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Je m'appelle lgor.''
Le Fils de Frankenstein !
Basil Rathbone rencontre
lgor, Bela Lugosi.
lls ressuscitent le monstre.
Moins bien que le film
de James whale,
- mais pas mal.
- Vous devez vous ennuyer !
Un ange à l'aile cassée.
Jarod se voit peut-être
en ange déchu.
Ou il a oublié de mettre
'fragile'' sur la boîîte.
''lgor connaîît le secret ?''
Lequel ?
On est au Centre !
Je vais me faire masser
par Bjorn.
Revoyez Le Fils de Frankenstein
et cherchez le lien
avec le petit génie.
Avec la moitié des nettoyeurs,
on le trouvera.
Et je ferai un peu de combustion
spontanée à ma façon.
C'est lui !
Je le fais sortir !
On m'a enlevé à ma famille.
Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà
plus doué que les autres.
Combien de gens sont morts
à cause de moi ?
Depuis mon évasion,
je cherche mon passé.
C'est un Caméléon.
Un génie qui peut devenir
qui il veut.
- Le Centre le veut vivant.
- De préférence.
ll défend les opprimés.
La vie est un don.
Vous êtes médecin ?
Aujourd'hui, oui.
Coupez !
Bon boulot, Jarod.
Je suis payé pour ça.
Vous passez
pour un cascadeur brûlant,
c'est le cas de le dire !
Brynne McLain.
- Merci d'être venue.
- C'est rare
de voir un C.V. en direct.
Mais l'idée sonne juste.
Je me demande pourquoi
vous faites cette cascade
vous-même.
Quand je crée une cascade,
je la teste toujours.
- Noble.
- C'est réfléchi.
Après l'accident
de la semaine dernière,
il vous faut
un cascadeur qui réfléchit.
Cette campagne
pour une nouvelle bière
était décisive.
L'accident nous met en faillite.
Je voulais donc que vous voyiez
si mes effets sonnaient juste.
Vu le prix de la campagne,
il me faut Pavarotti.
Un geste et votre matière grise
vole en éclats.
Comment va lgor ?
Qu'il ne ronfle pas.
Ce n'est pas le bruit
qui est gênant,
mais les ongles de pied crochus.
Très drôle, Jarod.
- Tu peux m'expliquer ?
- Demande à lgor.
C'est vrai.
''ll connaîît le secret.''
On peut jouer aux devinettes
plus tard ?
Oui, si tu me révèles
le secret de mon identité.
Tu sais
queje ne peuxpas t'aider.
Alors, moi non plus.
Mais mes entrailles
ne me trompent pas.
Tu comprendras.
Qu'est-ce que tu regardes ?
Marianne Bosha
est en direct sur les lieux.
Tragédie sur le tournage
d'un spotpour la bière Blaster.
Un cascadeur a été hospitalisé
pour brûlures
après avoir traversé
cette affiche enflammée
en Cadillac.
L'explosion a été
bien plus forte que prévu.
Toutes nos pensées
et nos prières,
ainsi que celles
de la brasserie Blaster,
vont à la famille Dugger.
Bon rétablissement à Dave.
En attendant,
une enquête
essaiera de déterminer
la cause de l'accident.
Comble de l'ironie,
cette cascade a été conçue
par l'ami d'enfance de Dugger,
Mickey Clausen.
Dave et moi,
on a souvent fait ça.
J'ignore ce qui s'estpassé.
Dave est mon meilleur ami.
Dave Dugger
est toujours en réanimation.
Son avenir demeure incertain.
Tragédie
sur le tournage pour Blaster
Cette campagne nous a coûté cher.
Blaster mise des millions
sur sa nouvelle bière.
Jarod fera exploser votre bière
à la télévision américaine.
Ca me plaîît.
Voilà ce à quoi on pense.
- Ray Slater, mon assistant.
- J'étais celui de Clausen.
On a revu
la trajectoire de l'explosion
pour que ce soit plus sûr,
mais plus impressionnant.
Ce sera à tomber.
Parlez-en au réalisateur.
lan ?
lan Tottenham,
voici Jarod Lugosi.
On a tous vu des explosions.
On veut que le public
vive l'explosion,
la touche, la sente,
qu'il en pleure.
Excusez-moi.
Pleurer ?
ll est pompeux.
Mais il a été primé
pour la super glu.
J'en suis... cloué sur place.
Vous connaissez notre concept ?
Je n'ai jamais vu les spots.
Montrez-les-lui.
Notre concept
tourne autour de deux jeunes.
Shawn et Joey.
- lls trouvent des billets...
- Dans une caisse de Blaster.
- lls traversent le pays...
- En Blastermobile.
- Pour voir un match.
- Mais ils se perdent.
lls arrivent en Louisiane.
Un vieux Cajun
leur dit d'aller à l'ouest.
- ll repartent...
- Et se retrouvent là.
Vise-moi ça !
Des ours polaires, des pingouins,
le père Noël.
C'estpas la Californie !
Non, mon vieux. C'est l'Alaska.
C'est reparti !
Ca surpasse les grenouilles
qui parlent !
Quelles grenouilles ?
La pub de l'an dernier ?
Shawn et Joey
arrivent en Californie
dans le dernier spot.
Mais ils ont trop d'énergie...
Et survolent San Diego
avant de rentrer
dans une affiche à Tijuana.
Génial, non ?
Que ce soit bien clair.
Des gens achèteront votre bière
pour deux crétins
qui ne savent pas lire une carte
et sont assez bêtes
pour traverser une affiche en feu ?
C'est notre cible.
On a trois jours pour finir.
Ca sonnera juste ?
Comme Pavarotti.
ll faut une télécommande
et je n'en trouve pas.
Les indices doivent
nous permettre de la trouver.
Fais quelque chose, lgor.
Prends feu, sonne...
Aide-moi !
Passez-moi votre portable.
Un mécanisme auditif
de déclenchement.
Comme la combustion spontanée
qui a fait sauter la boîîte.
Jarod est énervant, mais malin.
Quand vous voulez, Brootsie.
Je tiens à mes doigts.
Donnez-moi ça.
Je m'appelle lgor.
lgor connaîît le secret.
C'est tout ?
Encore une impasse.
Vous lui ressemblez.
Ressembler à qui ?
Votre mère.
lgor connaîît un secret sur elle.
Oubliez malin.
Jarod est juste énervant.
Broots, étudiez tous les disques,
toutes les pistes possibles.
Sydney, cherchez
toute référence à lgor,
nom, anagramme, acronyme...
Tu as attiré mon attention.
ll vous faut des cascadeurs ?
Pas si on isole la chaussette.
On mettra du caoutchouc
sur les chaussures.
- Un jouet à monter ?
- Une maquette.
Enfant, vous n'en faisiez pas ?
Une fois, j'ai construit
l'Empire State.
Et j'ai sculpté un pacemaker
dans du savon.
J'ai fait mieux.
Depuis quand vous êtes sobre ?
Votre badge.
Ca fait 5 ans et des poussières.
Bravo !
Dave Dugger m'a parrainé.
Le cascadeur brûlé.
Je suis sobre grâce à Dave,
je suis vivant grâce à lui.
ll semble être un bon ami.
C'est elle ?
Elle était superbe
avant le feu.
Voilà ce que donne
trop de chlorate de potassium.
C'est la conclusion de Brynne ?
Mickey Clausen a merdé.
Point final.
J'ai du mal à comprendre
comment il a pu faire ça.
On sait tous
que la substance est réactive.
C'est du spectacle !
ll faut des effets
qui en jettent !
Mickey aurait risqué
la vie de son ami
pour sa réputation ?
Malheureusement,
je vois ça comme ça.
Halitosis.
Pardon ?
La créature du Souffle de la mort.
Ca doit devenir un classique
pour les amateurs
d'effets spéciaux.
- Je vous connais ?
- Jarod Lugosi.
J'aurais aimé vous poser
quelques questions.
C'est du jamais vu !
Mon remplaçant
me demande des tuyaux.
J'aime m'inspirer des meilleurs.
- Vos parents ?
- Ceux de Dave Dugger.
- Vous étiez proches ?
- Comme des frères.
Ses parents m'ont élevé.
Mais cette époque est révolue.
A cause de l'accident ?
J'ai dû faire
une erreur de calcul.
Vous croyez ?
Une voiture n'explose pas seule.
Vous avez vu quelque chose
sur les rushes ?
Je peux pas les visionner.
Tenez.
Prenez ça.
Je fais trop de cauchemars.
J'aurais préféré
être dans la voiture.
Vous avez revu
Dave ou ses parents ?
Je n'en ai pas le courage.
Pas après ça.
Si vous n'allez pas à l'hôpital,
ils ne sauront jamais
ce que vous éprouvez.
Ne perdez pas
ceux que vous aimez.
Prêt ? Vas-y !
Comment ?
Sortez-le de là !
Au secours !
Sortez-le de là !
ll n'y a pas eu une explosion.
ll y en a eu deux.
Vous lui ressemblez.
lgor connaîît le secret.
Je m'appelle lgor.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Oubliez lgor.
Vous n'avez rien trouvé ?
J'ai examiné l'unité centrale.
Ni acronymes ni anagrammes,
rien sur lgor.
J'ai parcouru mes dossiers
sans trouver ce nom.
Eteignez-moi ça ou je le tue.
J'écoute mes entrailles.
Les entrailles...
Que faites-vous ?
J'ai écouté mes entrailles.
Désolé.
Mickey !
Ca devrait donner ça.
C'est tout ? J'ai vu mieux !
Ces baskets ont marché
dans du carburant.
Ajoutons
de la dissolution de caoutchouc.
- Que ça en jette !
- Pas trop.
On a beaucoup investi
sur Joey et Shawn.
Payez des doublures !
Trempons-les dans l'essence.
Facile à dire pour vous, lan !
On voit bien
que c'est pas vous. Et en plus...
Ca suffit.
ll a raison.
L'essence est trop volatile.
La sécurité ne fait pas vendre.
ll reste un jour et demi.
Aidez-moi, Jarod.
J'ai une idée.
Du napalm.
- D'où ça vient ?
- Je l'ai fabriqué.
Vous fabriquez du napalm ?
C'est Mickey qui m'a appris.
Avec le bon dosage,
on a une grosse explosion.
Parfait pour les chaussures.
Vous avez de l'avenir.
La cassette d'lgor est une vidéo
du niveau souterrain 27.
C'était comme ça avant l'incendie.
1 2 avril 1 970.
La veille
de la mort de votre mère.
Maman !
M. Fenigor ?
M. Fenigor ? Fen...
lgor !
Vous le reconnaissez ?
Trop sombre.
Vous savez où est Timmy ?
Dans la salle 155.
Je dois faire sortir
Jarod et Timmy ce soir.
J'écoute mes entrailles.
Faites disparaître
les cassettes de surveillance.
ll ne fautpas qu'on trouve ça.
Je m'en occupe.
La vie des enfants
dépend de nous.
C'est qui, Timmy ?
M. lgor aidait ma mère
à le sauver.
Ainsi que Jarod.
Vous connaissiez Timmy ?
Je voudrais plus de coopération.
Qui est-ce ?
Quand pourrai-je sortir,
Dr Raines ?
En temps voulu, Timmy.
ll pleure, Sydney.
ll a peur.
Je veux lui parler.
C'était un des projets de Raines.
Si ça se passait
au niveau souterrain 27...
C'est que Timmy était
un des cobayes de Raines.
Trouvez qui est Fenigor.
Revoyez vos dossiers,
cherchez une trace de Timmy.
On va trouver la salle 1 55.
Au niveau souterrain 27 ?
Encore ?
Ma mère n'avait pas peur
d'y aller. Vous, si ?
Un peu !
Si Raines l'apprend,
il nous tuera.
Veillez à ce qu'il l'ignore.
ll n'y a pas de fumée sans feu.
Tu vas te taire ?
Ca fait 5 ans et des poussières.
ll n'y avait rien sur Fenigor.
La seule trace du séjour
de Timmy au Centre
est une simple feuille de sortie
signée par le Dr Raines
et datée du 1 4 avril 1 970.
Le lendemain de la mort
de ma mère. Quelle coïncidence !
Regardez !
Le bébé des Lindbergh kidnappé
Depuis quand le Centre fait ça ?
Vous bouquinez
ou vous nous aidez ?
- Autre chose sur Timmy ?
- Très peu.
Ni nom de famille ni adresse.
Rien d'extraordinaire.
Alors, pourquoi ma mère
tenait tant à le sauver ?
Comme l'a dit la créature :
''lgor connaîît le secret.''
Le secret de la mort de ma mère,
voire de son assassinat.
Doucement, Parker.
Chaque chose en son temps.
Ce dont vous parlez
peut nous coûter la vie.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Une chaise neuro-électrique.
Pour un gosse ?
C'est à devenir dingue !
Je me souviens de rumeurs
sur des expériences clandestines
liées aux ondes cérébrales.
Pas étonnant que ma mère
ait voulu sauver Timmy,
sauver tous les enfants.
C'est incroyable.
Allons-nous-en.
On ne saura jamais
ce qu'est devenu Timmy.
Peut-être, peut-être pas.
A quoi pensez-vous, Einstein ?
Faisons venir Angelo.
ll sentira peut-être
ce qui s'est passé.
Que faites-vous ?
Vous ne pouvez pas
vendre tout ça.
Dites-le à Dave et ses parents.
lls essaient de digérer
ce qui s'est passé.
Hollywood l'a digéré.
Aucun cascadeur
ne travaillera plus avec moi.
C'est incroyable.
Vous avez bonne réputation.
C'est le dernier boulot
qui compte.
C'est fini.
Bon, j'achète tout.
J'achète tout.
M. Formaldéhyde.
Le rouge à lèvres du cyclope.
Et toutes
vos créations grotesques.
Ca n'est pas à vendre !
C'est Dave Dugger.
On l'a fait ensemble.
Je n'oublierai jamais ce visage.
Je ne sais pas
ce que je vais faire.
Qu'est-ce que je vais faire ?
Je ne l'ai jamais vu comme ça !
ll est peut-être confronté
à des associations négatives
avec le niveau souterrain 27.
ll n'est pas le seul.
C'est une mauvaise idée.
S'il peut nous aider,
c'est une bonne idée.
Allons, Angelo !
Que s'est-il passé ici ?
- C'est risqué.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
Qui est Timmy ?
Plus de Timmy.
Reviens, Angelo.
Plus de Timmy.
C'est Jarod.
Vous travaillez encore ?
Je fais un peu de rangement.
J'ai une bonne nouvelle.
Dave a repris connaissance
et vous réclame.
Vous êtes là, Ray ?
C'est formidable, Jarod.
J'arrive.
Tu m'entends ?
Tu peux parler ?
Je suis désolée, Angelo.
Parle-moi.
Tu peux m'aider à découvrir
qui a tué ma mère.
Je sais
combien ça vous tient à coeur.
Mais on arrive dans une impasse.
Je ne veux pas d'impasse.
Ce trou infernal
renferme des réponses
sur Timmy et lgor,
sur la vérité au sujet de ma mère.
ll est temps d'examiner
les dossiers privés de Raines.
Tu es réveillé ?
Approche.
Dur de parler.
Ca va ?
Je risque pas d'aller danser.
Je suis désolé.
Ne flanche pas, Ray.
Maintenant que Mickey m'a lâché...
ll faut
que mes vrais amis soient forts.
Tu es le seul véritable ami
qui me reste.
Qu'est-ce qui t'arrive ?
Tu as les mains qui tremblent.
J'ai recommencé à boire, Dave.
Pourquoi ?
C'est la culpabilité.
De quoi ?
De ce que je t'ai fait.
Je ne comprends pas.
Ce n'est pas la faute de Mickey.
ll te couvrait.
Brynne ne supportait pas
les refus.
On parlait d'explosions
et je lui ai fait une petite
démonstration avec du napalm.
C'est elle qui en a volé
et versé sur le radiateur.
Elle a menacé de m'impliquer
si je parlais.
Avec mon passé, qui me croira ?
Et ma carrière, ma famille ?
Ma vie aurait été finie.
Je vous ai trahis,
Mickey et toi, pour me sauver.
Je suis désolé, Dave.
Ne vous inquiétez pas, Ray.
Le premier pas vers le pardon,
c'est de dire la vérité.
Allô, Brynne ?
C'est Jarod.
J'ai fait
une découverte explosive
et je vous en offre la primeur.
On peut se voir demain matin ?
Parfait.
Je ne vois jamais mes collègues
en dehors du travail.
On a de la chance,
c'est fini demain.
Tant qu'on travaille encore,
sachez qu'avec tout ce napalm,
la Cadillac
va ressembler à Bagdad
pendant la guerre du Golfe.
Regardez.
On fait un tour de Cadillac
avant de l'envoyer à la casse ?
Votre ceinture.
Vous pensiez aller où ?
Je pensais traverser l'affiche.
- Quoi ?
- Rassurez-vous.
Tout est au point
comme pour Dave Dugger.
J'ai même mis du napalm
sur le radiateur.
Comme vous.
Je descends.
lnutile d'essayer.
Cette super glu est puissante.
Vous en avez fait la pub.
Vous êtes fou ?
On l'a cru
quand je me suis mis le feu.
Mais avec une protection,
on s'en tire.
Dave Dugger
en aurait fait autant.
Mais comment pouvait-il
prévoir cette explosion ?
Je ne comprends pas.
Une brûlure au 3e degré
vous rafraîîchira la mémoire.
Allons, Brynne.
Ce sera à tomber !
Je vous en prie !
Pourquoi avoir mis du napalm ?
Pour améliorer la pub ?
Dites-moi,
la vente de bière
compte plus qu'une vie ?
Je risquais de perdre le contrat.
Et Mickey et Dave,
qu'ont-ils perdu ?
Tout ! Vous ne risquiez
que votre boulot.
Que mon boulot ?
J'en ai bavé pour y arriver.
C'est un monde d'hommes !
Je refuse de tout perdre
parce que le cascadeur
manque d'audace !
Vous savez quoi ?
Je ne pense pas que vous aurez
une promotion après ça.
Mais soyez positive.
Vous avez de l'avenir
comme cascadeuse.
- C'est enregistré ?
- La 1 re prise est la bonne.
C'est dans la boîîte !
J'ai trouvé Timmy.
Dans les archives de Raines.
Envoyez.
Que faites-vous ici, Mme Parker ?
Je viens voir Timmy.
Ce n'estpas une bonne idée.
Mon mari tient à ce que
je rende visite aux enfants.
Attendez.
Je m'appelle Catherine.
Ca va ?
Mes parents me manquent.
Je sais, chéri.
Allez, Timmy !
C'est tout ?
ll y a un disque du lendemain.
ll ne fallaitpas entrer !
Qu'avez-vous fait à cet enfant ?
C'était une expérience !
Mon mari n'acceptera pas ça !
Vous ne le connaissez pas bien.
Je vous conseille
de garder le silence,
si vous tenez à la vie.
Qu'allez-vous faire de Timmy ?
ll n'y a plus de Timmy.
Désormais, il s'appelle...
Angelo.
Timmy, c'est Angelo ?
Que lui a fait Raines ?
En quelque sorte, ses émotions,
sa capacité à communiquer
avec le monde physique
ont été inhibées,
ce qui a donné à Angelo
ce don extraordinaire.
En lui retirant sa vie.
Vous étiez mêlé à Ca ?
Si j'avais été au courant,
j'aurais tout fait
pour que ça cesse.
Et vous seriez mort.
Comme ma mère.
ll vous a vendu
tout son matériel ?
Je sais.
Vous acceptez de le revendre ?
- Pour un bon prix.
- Le double !
ll l'a bien cherché !
Merci.
Timmy est parti.
Les blancs
choisissent cette tactique
pour répondre
à la défense des noirs.
Très bien, Jarod.
Qui êtes-vous, M. lgor ?
Et l'autre garçon ?
ll estparti.
- Comment ça ?
- J'ai reçu le document.
Le Dr Raines l'a fait sortir.
Qu'a-t-il fait de mal ?
ll n'étaitpas doué.
Tu étais doué, Timmy.
Que te disent tes entrailles ?
A ton avis ?
Pourquoi cejeu ?
ll suffisait de me parler !
Parfois la destination
compte moins que le voyage.
Au cours de ton voyage,
où tu as trouvé cette cassette ?
Dans un des coffres de ta mère.
Comme son alliance
et son dossier médical.
Si tu savais ce qu'il y avait !
Tu connais la musique.
Révèle-moi un secret sur moi,
je t'en révélerai un sur toi.
On n'a rien pu trouver
sur lgor ou Fenigor.
J'ignore sa position
envers ma mère.
Continue à chercher.
lgor connaîît les secrets
de ton passé et du mien.
Qu'est-ce qui te fait dire ça ?
Mes entrailles.

On s'en va tŰt !
lls vont te voir !
Un malheur est arrivť, Sydney.
Le temps presse.
Allons ailleurs.
J'ai besoin de rťponses.
Qui je suis, d'oý je viens,
qui sont mes parents.
Donnez-moi quelque chose,
ne serait-ce qu'un nom.
ll faut que je sache.
Moi aussi.
Moi aussi.
Je ne comprends pas.
lls mťritent des rťponses.
Jacob !
Je ne comprends pas.
C'est compliquť.
Je t'en prie,
le temps presse.
Bonjour, Broots.
Pardon de vous dťranger.
Laissez-moi deviner. Jarod ?
C'est arrivť ce matin,
Áa vient
de l'Astro Arcade d'lndianapolis.
ll y travaillait ?
Non, il traÓÓnait lŗ-bas.
Le propriťtaire dit
qu'il a jouť ŗ Áa pendant 24 h
avec 25 cents.
Pas mal !
Et qu'en pense Sydney ?
ll vous a laissť un message.
''Notre ami ťtouffť est rťveillť.''
ll est rťveillť.
Jacob est une menace
pour le Centre.
Assurez-vous
qu'il ne se rťveille plus.
''Je pars ŗ la pÍche.''
Trouvez Sydney.
31 ''48. ll est rapide.
ll est encore ŗ une seconde
du record.
Tu as mis 5 ans
ŗ y arriver.
ll dťbarque ŗ peine.
- Et son nom de famille ?
- Jones.
En tout cas,
il pilote comme Parnelli.
La voiture MCl arrive.
Les essais
sont ouverts pour 24 h.
C'ťtait incroyable !
Quel pilote !
Belle performance !
Hťlas, mon pied a glissť
sur la pťdale au 4e tour.
Oý vous avez appris ŗ piloter ?
lndianapolis.
Vraiment ? Sur le circuit ?
A l'Astro Arcade.
On m'a enlevť ŗ ma famille.
Au bout de 36 h, il semble dťjŗ
plus douť que les autres.
Combien de gens sont morts
ŗ cause de moi ?
Depuis mon ťvasion,
je cherche mon passť.
C'est un Camťlťon.
Un gťnie qui peut devenir
qui il veut.
- Le Centre le veut vivant.
- De prťfťrence.
ll dťfend les opprimťs.
La vie est un don.
Vous Ítes mťdecin ?
Aujourd'hui, oui.
Voici Nigel Brinkman,
notre pilote nl1 .
- Bienvenue.
- Content d'Ítre lŗ.
Jarod remplacera Jimmy
sur la voiture 3.
ll a eu un accident
ŗ Milwaukee ?
Mon fils s'est cassť la jambe.
ll ne pilotera pas avant un an.
Mais un Roemer ne renonce jamais.
Jimmy s'est emportť.
ll a pris la voiture de R.J.
et est rentrť dans un mur.
Je comprends que R.J. se mťfie.
Mes fils peuvent assumer.
C'est Áa, la course.
On va s'occuper de vous.
Je veux le meilleur
pour mes pilotes.
Je vois Áa.
C'est vieux, Áa !
Ce couteau
est le 1 er trophťe de R.J.
ll a gagnť un championnat.
Lŗ, c'est le prix junior.
ll a fini second ŗ Long Beach.
Ca ne devrait pas Ítre lŗ.
J'aurais gagnť
avec une voiture bien rťglťe.
Je ne reproche rien au mťcanicien.
Hawkes est un dinosaure.
L'hŰpital accepte les visites...
- Pardon.
- Ce n'est rien, entrez.
Je vais vťrifier la tťlťmťtrie.
Et Jimmy ?
J'essaierai de passer le voir.
Anna, Jarod Jones
remplacera Jimmy.
C'est ma belle-fille.
Elle s'occupera des papiers.
On fait un test ŗ 1 3 h.
C'est un peu gÍnant.
C'est la course.
J'espŤre que votre mari
va se rťtablir.
Merci.
Les mťdecins attendent
pour dire si c'est
dťfinitif.
Remplissez
une fiche d'informations.
D'informations ?
- Pour les mťdias.
- Je ne veux pas de publicitť.
Vous allez rťpondre
ŗ des questions
et courir les cocktails !
Je suis sŻr que Ca s'arrangera.
Votre famille semble trŤs unie.
On dirait, hein ?
L'accident de Jimmy Roemer
CarriŤre incertaine
pour Jimmy Roemer
Du nouveau ?
J'ai lu et relu
le message de Sydney.
A mon avis,
il est ŗ white Cloud.
Oý Áa ?
Sydney a un chalet prŤs du lac.
Parfois, il va pÍcher lŗ-bas.
Sydney et les truites.
On croit rÍver.
Vous savez oý c'est ?
Notez l'itinťraire.
J'ignore qui est
''l'ami ťtouffť rťveillť''.
L'itinťraire, Broots.
Le dernier mot est white Cloud.
Pas besoin
qu'on me fasse un dessin.
Vous Ítes concurrents ?
Disons que R.J.
me soutient.
Comment ?
ll n'est pas trŤs clair,
ŗ force de respirer
mes gaz d'ťchappement !
Pardon.
Elle m'a ťchappť.
Vous ne m'avez pas signťe.
On s'est vus ce matin.
Vous Ítes aussi pilote ?
La vie et la mort
sont au coeur de l'existence
d'un pilote.
Je peux vous aider ?
J'ai pas de grosse voiture,
j'aimerais que
vous me dťposiez quelque part.
D'accord.
C'est l'hŰpital oý est Jimmy.
Je veux voir
celui que je remplace.
Vous m'accompagnez ?
Ce doit Ítre difficile
de travailler dur
sans soutien pour gagner.
Je gagnerai. ll le faut.
Que faisait Jimmy
dans votre voiture ?
La voiture 3
avait de mauvais rťsultats.
Jimmy
voulait essayer la mienne.
J'ai acceptť. Point final.
Selon le rapport,
Jimmy a accťlťrť
en heurtant le mur.
J'aime mon frŤre, mais
il ne connaÓÓt pas ses limites.
Votre frŤre a une maladie rare.
Cela a stimulť son cerveau
et rťveillť une zone blessťe.
ll sait oý il est ?
Ses capacitťs motrices
sont ťlťmentaires
et il ne parle
que de faÁon trŤs hachťe.
J'aimerais le voir.
Auparavant, il faut
que vous sachiez une chose.
Tu m'entends ?
C'est Sydney.
ll semble passer
du coq ŗ l'‚ne.
Je ne sais pas
qui est cette Greta.
C'ťtait le nom de notre mŤre.
Ecoute-moi bien.
Tu sais en quelle annťe on est ?
1 942.
Je voudrais l'emmener.
On a mis Sydney sur ťcoute.
Vous avez raison.
Son frŤre est vivant.
Mais vous allez arranger Áa, non ?
Volontiers.
Tu as trop chaud ?
Non, Áa va.
Ta rťťducation va commencer.
J'aimerais commencer aujourd'hui.
Voilŗ mon idiot de petit frŤre.
- Oý tu ťtais passť ?
- J'aime pas les boiteux !
Comment elle s'appelle ?
Coupable !
- Tu es venu ?
- ll faut croire en sa famille.
Tu peux aller chercher
ma casquette ? J'ai chaud.
N'abuse pas des friandises !
Jimmy Roemer.
Jarod pilote la voiture 3.
Bravo. Gagnez pour notre ťquipe.
Je vous garde la place.
- Ca va ?
- Comme un Roemer ŗ plat.
Repose-toi.
Ca reviendra.
Je me sens ridicule
d'avoir cassť sa bagnole.
J'ai perdu le contrŰle, je sais,
pourtant j'ai freinť.
Le moteur s'est emballť.
Tu te rappelles
le soir de mon diplŰme ?
Papa ťtait furieux !
J'ai heurtť
un poteau.
Mais Ca a pas coŻtť
Sers-moi ŗ boire.
Ca va ?
Oui, on a dŻ mal ŗ croire que
je pilote une voiture de course.
Ca arrive ŗ tout le monde.
Je t'emmŤne
au chalet de white Cloud.
Tu adorais y aller.
Par lŗ.
Je bloque l'escalier.
L‚chez ce balai.
ll ne comprend pas.
Jolie course. Je vous ai vu.
Un conseil : au premier tour,
ralentissez
sur les bosses.
- Ca marchera.
- Je m'en souviendrai.
Soyez prudent.
1 7 courses, 6 mois sans podium !
C'est inacceptable, messieurs.
ll faut Ítre une ťquipe.
Vous devez aider la voiture 1
ŗ rester en tÍte.
Et moi ?
Pas de ''moi'' !
On forme une ťquipe.
Jarod et toi devez aider Nigel
et bloquer le premier
pour qu'il le dťpasse.
Le blocage est interdit.
- C'est la course.
- On doit faire la circulation !
Tu sais ce que coŻte
l'entretien de trois voitures ?
Les sponsors veulent
que leur produit gagne,
sinon ils changent d'ťquipe
et tu recommences
ŗ conduire des camions !
Sois moins fou que ton frŤre.
Du calme.
Hawkes a raison.
Jimmy ne devait pas Ítre
dans la voiture 2.
Regarde les temps.
Je devrais avoir la voiture 1 .
J'ai un truc ŗ vous montrer,
Hawkes.
ll faut faire taire cet enfoirť !
Voilŗ l'esprit Roemer
que je cherche.
Si Ca pouvait Ítre pareil
sur la piste !
Tu parles d'une ťquipe !
Vous m'avez fait
une de ces peurs !
Vous vous attendiez
ŗ deux cadavres ?
Que vous a promis Raines ?
De quoi vous parlez ?
Des nettoyeurs qui ont dťbarquť
ŗ l'hŰpital.
Vous avez prťvenu Raines !
- Avouez-le !
- L‚chez-moi !
Vous seule savez
que mon frŤre est vivant.
Raines croit que je l'ai tuť.
S'il apprend qu'il est vivant,
je suis en danger.
Votre tťlťphone
doit Ítre sur ťcoute.
L‚chez-moi, maintenant.
ll a parlť ?
J'ai besoin de communiquer,
j'ai besoin de rťponses.
Des rťponses ?
Sur ce que j'ai fait.
Vous avez freinť,
le moteur a continuť ŗ tourner.
Jimmy passait toujours au stand.
Ca lui rappelait l'ťglise.
Merci d'avoir emmenť R.J.
voir Jimmy. Ca l'aide.
C'est ce que je pensais.
Comment va-t-il ?
ll a l'impression d'avoir trahi.
Trahi qui ?
Moi, R.J., surtout son pŤre.
Grant n'est pas un tendre.
ll a toujours encouragť
la compťtition.
Jimmy avait 7 ans,
Grant l'a emmenť au chalet
avec R.J.
lls devaient couper du bois.
Le gagnant aurait droit
ŗ un couteau Odekirk.
Avec toutes les options.
J'ai vu la photo.
Deux gosses ne pouvaient pas
couper ce bois.
Grant le savait.
ll les a laissťs seuls
dans le froid.
- Et alors ?
- ll y avait une scierie pas loin.
R.J. a fait dťmarrer le tracteur,
est parti dans la montagne
acheter du bois coupť
et a gagnť le couteau.
Le vrai trophťe
ťtait la fiertť du pŤre !
ll est prÍt ŗ tout pour Ca.
Ca ne changera jamais.
Vous vous souvenez de ma mŤre ?
Vous Ítes son portrait crachť.
Mais vous vous souvenez d'elle ?
Essayez de vous rappeler.
Pourquoi vous ne pouvez pas ?
Parce qu'il est mourant.
Le virus qui a rťveillť Jacob
est aussi en train de le tuer.
ll lui reste moins de 1 2 heures.
Je suis dťsolťe, Sydney.
Que peut-on faire ?
Broots va m'apporter
des affaires personnelles :
photos, films d'amateur.
Si seulement Áa pouvait aider
Jacob ŗ se souvenir,
il pourrait nous parler
de votre mŤre.
Ou de Jarod.
Peut-Ítre que Ca lui permettra
simplement de mourir...
en sachant qui il est.
Ca va aller.
Un Andretti se passe de conseils,
mais ťvitez les bosses.
Vous ne le regretterez pas.
Ce conseil m'est familier.
Merci quand mÍme.
- C'est quoi ?
- Un c‚ble d'accťlťrateur.
- Vous Ítes inspecteur ?
- Je me renseigne.
Ces rayures m'ťchappent.
Jimmy a cassť l'embrayage.
Et Áa donne quoi ?
Ca bloque l'accťlťrateur.
Comme pour Jimmy ?
J'ai examinť la voiture.
C'ťtait pas
une erreur mťcanique.
Et ces marques ?
C'est l'accident.
Je suis pas mťcano, mais
on les croirait faites ŗ la pince.
C'est vrai,
vous Ítes pas mťcano.
C'est joli, ici !
Je peux venir avec ma fille
un week-end ?
- C'est tout ?
- Oui.
Partez.
Je peux aller aux toilettes ?
C'est lŗ ?
Attendez.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Mon frŤre, Jacob.
ll est malade.
Dites un mot ŗ quiconque
et vous serez portť disparu
ŗ travers tout le pays.
Compris ?
Retournez au Centre.
Si vous remarquez quelque chose,
appelez-moi.
ll nous faut 1 0 heures.
Compris ?
ll n'y a pas plus clair.
Pourquoi vouloir tuer
votre frŤre, R.J. ?
Je viens d'arriver.
Non, tout semble calme.
Bien sŻr, je ne dirai rien.
Faites-moi une faveur.
Souhaitez bonne chance
ŗ Sydney de ma part.
Je dťteste qu'elle fasse Áa !
Bon sang !
Dťsolť.
Vous Ítes tracassť, R.J. ?
Je dois rťparer Áa.
Vous n'auriez pas un tournevis
ou une pince ?
Quelqu'un a volť
toutes les pinces hier.
On ne peut plus se fier
ŗ personne !
Essayez Áa.
Un Odekirk.
On en trouve peu.
Oý vous l'avez eu ?
Je l'ai gagnť il y a un an.
Comment ?
C'ťtait ŗ moi.
Mauvais perdant, hein ?
R.J. menaÁait de prendre
la voiture 1 , Brinkman ?
Tu te souviens
des matches de tennis ŗ Yale ?
Je suis persuadť
que tu me laissais gagner.
Ecoute-moi.
Tu sais des choses, Jacob.
Des choses
qui peuvent aider les autres.
Tu te souviens de Jarod ?
C'est toi qui l'as admis
au Centre.
Parker et moi,
on a trouvť des dossiers.
Tu as signť sa fiche d'admission.
Rťflťchis bien.
D'oý venait-il ?
Quel ťtait son vrai nom ?
Le nom de ses parents ?
Je lui dois bien Áa.
Depuis ton accident,
j'ai fait des choses.
Des choses indicibles
pour protťger Jarod.
Pour te protťger.
J'ai mÍme tentť de tuer Raines,
mais j'ai touchť
la bouteille d'oxygŤne...
Puissant, non ?
J'ai reconstituť
le moteur de Jimmy.
Tout seul.
Mais j'ai dŻ remplacer
le c‚ble d'accťlťrateur.
Je devrais Ítre inspecteur.
Que voulez-vous ?
Vous vous rappelez ces marques ?
Elles ont bel et bien
ťtť faites avec une pince.
La pince d'un couteau Odekirk.
Celui-ci.
ll appartenait ŗ R.J.,
mais il l'a perdu
lors d'un pari contre Brinkman.
Quel rapport avec moi ?
Bonne question.
C'est une cassette
de surveillance
des garages de Milwaukee.
Elle date
de la veille de l'accident.
On vous voit faire entrer
Brinkman dans le garage de la 2.
Brinkman craignait
que R.J. prenne la voiture 1 .
ll ignorait que Jimmy
serait au volant ce jour-lŗ !
Pourquoi j'aurais fait Áa
ŗ R.J. ?
Parce qu'il voulait
vous remplacer.
J'ai trouvť des C.V.
Des candidats pour votre poste.
J'ai 56 ans.
Je ne peux pas repartir ŗ zťro.
Je ne voulais pas de mal
ŗ Jimmy.
ll faisait quoi
dans cette voiture ?
ll me couvrait.
Votre main.
J'ai des spasmes depuis six mois.
Le jour de la course,
j'ai dit ŗ Jimmy
de me remplacer.
J'ai vu des cas semblables,
Áa se soigne.
Je m'en occuperai plus tard.
Pensons ŗ Jimmy.
J'ai tout g‚chť.
J'ai trahi mon pŤre
et failli tuer mon frŤre.
Vous ignoriez
le sabotage de Brinkman.
Maintenant, je sais.
Je vais essayer de tout arranger.
On essaiera tous.
Non, ne me mentez pas.
Je vous assure,
je ne connais aucun Jacob.
Six heures, M. Broots.
Protťger quelqu'un comme Sydney
vaut tant d'inconfort ?
Je ne comprends pas.
Je vais vous rafraÓÓchir
la mťmoire.
Je crois que Áa me revient !
Anna ? C'est Jarod.
Jimmy peut venir
sur le circuit demain ?
Service des Mines
C'est Jarod.
Hawkes a du nouveau pour vous.
Vous pouvez venir demain ?
A demain.
Je n'ai pas assez de couverture.
- Le micro pour parler au public ?
- Au fond.
C'est le problŤme.
ll y a cinq camťras,
il en faut le double.
Regardez dans le camion !
La tťlť ! C'est ŗ devenir fou.
Je peux avoir
les positions des camťras ?
Une seconde et demie
entre les deux voitures de tÍte.
Nigel ! Content de vous voir.
Si la voiture peut aller
plus vite, je suis partant !
- Oý est Grant ?
- Vu votre dernier entretien,
on a prťfťrť garder Áa
pour nous jusqu'au bout.
Essayons.
Bonne chance, Nigel !
PrÍt !
Partez !
Alors ?
Jusque-lŗ, Áa va.
Je la chauffe et on verra.
Que fait Brinkman ?
Regardez Áa.
Ensuite, on parlera.
Au prochain tour, j'y vais !
Ca donne quoi ?
Je suis ŗ fond.
Vous pouvez aller plus vite !
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Je cherche la vťritť
sur l'accident de Jimmy.
Je comprends pas.
Les mensonges.
Voilŗ de quoije parle.
Je sais rien sur l'accident.
Je m'arrÍte.
Pas si vite, Nigel !
Je contrŰle votre voiture.
Vous Ítes fou !
Vous croyez ?
Je peuxpas ralentir !
Vous savez ce que Áa fait.
Attention, pas d'accident !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Pourquoi saboter
la voiture de R.J. ?
Vous avez failli tuer Jimmy.
ArrÍtez cette voiture !
ArrÍtez !
Ca a failli.
Sachez que
j'ai fait le plein.
De quoi parcourir
au moins
70 tours.
Maisj'ai mis quatre vieuxpneus.
L'un d'eux va bientŰt exploser.
C'est clair ?
J'en peuxplus !
C'est le but.
D'accord,
j'ai trafiquť la voiture
sans savoir que Jimmy piloterait.
Je perds le contrŰle.
C'est arrivť ŗ Jimmy.
Le mur !
Vous l'avez dit.
C'est la course.
Nigel Brinkman ? Suivez-nous.
Je t'en prie.
Le temps presse.
Je suis lŗ.
Sache que quoi que tu aies fait,
quoi qu'on ait fait,
je ne t'en voudrai jamais.
Je crois qu'on a volť
sa vie ŗ Jarod.
Et nous serons jugťs pour Áa.
Mais j'ai appris
ŗ ťviter la colŤre
et ŗ pardonner.
J'espŤre seulement qu'un jour...
Jarod ťprouvera la mÍme chose.
Gene.
Gene qui ?
Essaie de l'ťcrire.
C'est le vrai nom de Jarod ?
Ou celui de son pŤre ?
Qui est Gene ?
Je t'en prie,
j'ai besoin de savoir.
Je suis dťsolťe, Sydney.
Jacob adorait cette chanson.
Et cet endroit.
ll a fini
par trouver le repos ici.
Oý est-il ?
- Vous avez des 7 ?
- Piochez.
Fouillez la chambre.
Des 5 ?
Vous trichez !
Personne.
Je sais que Jacob ťtait lŗ.
Vous faites erreur.
Mon frŤre est mort.
ll est dangereux
de trahir le Centre.
Ne le cherchez pas.
Un homme de sa trempe
et son adresse au tir,
c'est de la dynamite.
C'est un endroit superbe.
Comment tu as su ?
J'ai appelť Broots.
ll m'a dit pour Jacob.
ll a dit que vous seriez absent
quelques jours du Centre.
C'est dur, d'Ítre seul au monde,
hein ?
J'espŤre que le dťpart de Jacob
a ťtť... paisible.
Je crois.
Avant de mourir,
mon frŤre m'a donnť Áa.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Peut-Ítre ton nom
ou celui de tes parents.
J'aimerais en Ítre sŻr.
En tout cas,
j'espŤre que Áa t'aidera
ŗ trouver ta propre paix.

Donne-moi ça.
Pourquoi les as-tu volés ?
J'ai fait ça.
Une maison ?
Un foyer.
C'est là quej'ai grandi.
D'après mes souvenirs.
C'est comment, un foyer ?
Un cobaye qui s'habille
en Hugo Boss ?
Ca vient de chez GQ.
Qu'en savez-vous ?
ll y en a pour 20 000 $
d'habits.
Vous avez un rival
en élégance.
Qu'est-ce qu'il mijote ?
Une forme d'expression.
lndividualisme, force.
ll parade comme un animal en rut.
Vous avez raison
pour le rut.
Le Kama Sutra de l'amour.
Qu'est-ce qu'il apprend ?
Je compte sur la gentillesse
des inconnues.
Jarod.
lsabella.
Je croyais que la galanterie
était morte.
Seulement blessée.
Vous préférez être appelé
''cavalier'' ou ''gigolo'' ?
Donnez-moi une heure,
et vous me direz.
On m'a enlevé à ma famille.
Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà
plus doué que les autres.
Combien de gens sont morts
à cause de moi ?
Depuis mon évasion,
je cherche mon passé.
C'est un Caméléon.
Un génie qui peut devenir
qui il veut.
- Le Centre le veut vivant.
- De préférence.
ll défend les opprimés.
La vie est un don.
Vous êtes médecin ?
Aujourd'hui, oui.
Pourquoi a-t-il laissé tout ça ?
Jarod n'opère pas
comme les autres.
Ca doit avoir un sens.
Ca en a toujours un.
Venez voir.
''Suivez-moi au 1 500, Hart Street.''
Ca semble simple.
Allons voir.
Votre part.
Le Kama Sutra vous a été utile ?
- Je l'ai prêté.
- Vous devez le savoir par coeur.
Un cadeau d'lsabella.
Que lui avez-vous fait ?
Je l'ai écoutée.
Je ne sais pas à qui vous envoyer.
On dit que Cynthia Sloan
cherche quelqu'un.
D'une comtesse européenne
à une V.l.P. de Detroit ?
C'est la femme la plus fortunée,
mais je peux la combler.
N'oubliez pas, Jarod.
Elles paient pour un fantasme,
pas pour un homme.
Vous pourrez devenir un autre ?
Je ferai de mon mieux.
Voici votre contrat.
ll va de soi
que vous êtes embauché comme...
Consultant spécial.
Tout ce que vous verrez et ferez
sera confidentiel.
Bien sûr.
- Sacrée maison.
- Et il y en a six autres.
Sept.
Jarod.
ll a signé ?
Frank l'exige.
ll supervise mes achats
et mes projets.
Et je suis...
Un peu des deux.
En piste !
Vous êtes ici pour une raison.
Pour éviter
que des hommes m'abordent.
Vous êtes un accessoire,
un bijou.
Je dois être brillant.
A 5 000 $ la semaine,
éblouissez-moi.
Vous m'accompagnerez
à l'inauguration samedi.
- Laquelle ?
- La Tour Sloan.
L'avenir du centre de Detroit.
Si c'est l'avenir,
alors, Ca doit être le passé.
Sauvez notre maison !
Ca fait quoi d'avoir une maison ?
Un enfant fait une chute mortelle
Laissez-le.
ll a une aile cassée.
J'aimerais que Michael soit là.
Michael Edwards.
ll est tombé
de l'échelle de secours.
ll soignait les oiseaux.
ll voulait être vétérinaire.
J'ai été vétérinaire.
Vous pouvez le faire voler ?
Je ne sais pas.
Tracy Johnson,
descends de ce toit !
J'y vais.
Elle va finir par se tuer.
Je connais bien le quartier,
mais pas votre tête.
Je voulais soigner l'oiseau.
Michael Edwards s'en occupait.
Que savez-vous de lui ?
Ce que j'ai lu.
C'est arrivé ici ?
Je lui ai dit 1 00 fois
de ne pas monter.
Jarod.
Alice Evans.
Enchanté.
ll est tombé de 3 étages.
Et ils vont démolir.
Cynthia Sloan peut dévorer
le dernier HLM de la ville.
Et mettre des familles à la rue.
Une échelle supporte
le poids d'un enfant de 8 ans.
La mairie a dit
que c'était le temps.
J'habite ici
depuis 40 ans.
Soudain, les briques
tombent en poussière ?
Ca m'étonnerait.
J'aurais aimé sauver ce petit.
Je ne suis pas libre.
Cynthia m'emploie jour et nuit.
Rassurez-vous.
C'est juste pour une nuit.
Mais parler ne suffira pas,
cette fois. Elle, ça la démange.
Ca la démange ?
Allez la gratter.
Je compte sur la gentillesse
des inconnues.
Le service m'envoie.
C'était rapide.
Je peux entrer ?
Oui, je vous en prie.
''Joyeuse Saint-Valentin.''
Servez-vous.
J'ai fait du café.
Torréfaction française.
Comment on sait à quoi c'est ?
On ne sait pas.
C'est la surprise.
Qui est Valentin ?
J'ignorais que vous seriez
beau et drôle.
A vrai dire, je n'ai jamais...
fait quelque chose comme ça.
Est-ce que je fais le chèque
à votre nom...
ou au service ?
On verra plus tard.
Je paierai en liquide.
ll y a un homme
au-dessus du garage.
C'est Howard, mon mari.
Votre mari ?
Bientôt mon ex.
ll vit là-haut en attendant.
J'allais oublier.
J'ai acheté une boîîte
à la pharmacie.
En promotion.
La boîîte de douze.
Prudence avant tout.
J'ai vu ça à la télé.
Vous semblez nerveuse.
Non, pas moi.
J'aime les photos dans une maison.
On se sent chez soi.
Mon dernier est à l'université.
ll me manque.
Je n'en dirai pas tant
d'Howard.
ll y avait une autre femme ?
Non. Devinez
ce qu'Howard m'a offert
pour nos 25 ans de mariage.
Un grille-pain.
J'avais acheté des billets
pour Paris.
ll n'a pas pu se libérer.
ll a revendu les billets
et acheté une télé.
Cinquante pouces.
Je n'ai que le café
pour me rappeler Paris.
On dit que vous valez le coup.
Vos enfants doivent vous manquer.
lls savent ?
Que vous avez un gigolo.
La mort de Michael Edwards
a conduit la mairie
à démolir Jefferson Heights.
Les habitants protestent.
Dans 4 jours, leur maison
sera démolie. Pour certains,
c'est du déjà vu.
lls ont voulu faire ça
après l'incendie de 77.
Les habitants avaientgagné.
A l'époque, ils avaient obtenu
des travaux de rénovation,
mais ils n'affrontaientpas
la géante Cynthia Sloan.
Mlle Sloan, un commentaire ?
Je compatis avec la famille
de Michael Edwards,
mais cet immeuble est dangereux.
Je rends service à tous.
A la mort de Michael, vous avez
forcé la main à la mairie.
Nous avons obtenu ce chantier
honnêtement.
Je n'ai pas honte
d'être compétitive.
Nous voulions ce contrat,
coûte que coûte.
Coûte que coûte.
Chlorure de soufre
A quoi sert
le chlorure de soufre ?
A la démolition.
Le chlorure de soufre
ronge la brique.
L'immeuble tombera
comme un château de cartes.
- Une dernière question.
- Allez-y.
La Saint-Valentin.
En particulier Cupidon.
Un bébé dodu qui est archer.
ll tire des flèches
et les gens sont amoureux ?
- C'est ça.
- Et en gage d'amour,
les gens s'achètent des chocolats
et des bonbons ?
lls veulent être dodus
comme le bébé ?
Vous faites quoi, déjà,
pour Mlle Sloan ?
Consultant spécial.
Dangereux.
Et comment !
Jarod a laissé l'adresse
d'une librairie porno ?
C'est une plaisanterie ?
Finissons-en.
Un souci, Broots ?
Je ne suis jamais allé
dans un tel endroit.
Et moi, je suis déléguée
des parents d'élèves.
Ca commence à vous revenir,
Broots ?
Jarod nous a amenés là
pour une raison.
Ca s'appelle l'humiliation.
ll y a quelqu'un ?
J'arrive tout de suite.
On veut voir le patron,
pour un ami.
Le patron, c'est Rex.
ll est mort.
Bucky La Fontaine.
Je suis gérant.
Un ami ?
ll a laissé ça.
ll fallait dire
que vous cherchiez Jarod.
Entrez.
Venez derrière.
Vous avez faim ?
Jarod était très sentimental.
Mais pas bête.
ll a inventé la hotte portable.
Vous ne voulez pas une aile ?
Sans façon.
Vous savez où il est allé ?
Aucune idée.
ll a cessé de venir.
ll était intéressé
par vos publications ?
Pas du tout.
Le sexe ne l'intéressait pas.
ll voulait parler des gens.
De ce qui provoque le désir.
ll a dû manquer d'affection, petit.
ll était fier du livre.
Le livre ?
Je suis éditeur
à mes heures.
Des romans d'amour...
Jarod a écrit un de ces romans ?
Oui.
Là.
Une triste Saint- Valentin
ll a dessiné la couverture.
ll est vraiment unique.
Un seul suffit.
Ca lui ira à ravir.
Qu'il soit prêt ce soir.
Vous n'êtes pas très photo.
Vous avez des tas de prix,
mais une seule photo.
Avec des photos,
on se sent chez soi.
Pas vrai ?
C'est vous ?
Mon père élevait
des chevaux de course.
Ca a dû faire mal.
Mon étalon s'est cabré.
J'ai gardé la cicatrice.
Mon chirurgien esthétique
travaille à la réduire.
Où est votre famille ?
Vous interrogez toujours
vos clientes ?
Pas toutes.
Vous ne vous sentez pas seule ?
La mairie refuse la démolition.
On a réunion.
Je n'ai pas le temps
d'être seule.
Soyez à l'heure ce soir.
Joyce m'a appelée.
Elle était insatisfaite.
Qu'est-ce qui vous arrive ?
ll lui en faut peu pour fondre.
Je ne sais pas
ce qu'elle veut.
On appelle un plombier
pour réparer une fuite.
Elle a appelé un gigolo.
Réparez sa fuite.
Je ne veuxpas
avoir à vous le redire.
Je viens de la laver.
C'est la voiture.
Ca la rend folle.
Comme ça,
vous êtes insatisfaite ?
Je vous attendais.
Vous savez que votre mari
est dans le jardin ?
Vous n'aurez pas de regrets ?
Au diable les regrets !
Je sais que tu es là.
J'appelle la police !
Tu veux le numéro ?
Je suis désolée.
Ce n'est rien.
Mais c'est bizarre.
Vous dites que votre mari
ne tient plus à vous.
Ce n'est pas
ce qu'il me semble.
Désolée. Je vous ai pris
pour un inspecteur.
Un inspecteur ?
Vous n'en verrez plus guère.
L'immeuble est condamné.
ll y avait des bureaucrates
partout.
Avant la chute de Michael.
On a inspecté l'échelle
avant qu'elle tombe ?
Quelqu'un de riche, comme vous.
Comme moi ?
ll avait de la quincaillerie
au poignet.
Comme ça ?
Avec des diamants.
Je voudrais porter un toast.
A cette oeuvre d'art
qu'on appelle un immeuble.
ll y a écrit ''Tour Sloan'',
mais ce projet était le rêve
de mon bras droit,
Frank Linden.
C'est son bébé
et s'il n'a pas de promotion,
autant me licencier moi-même.
Quand personne n'y croyait,
pas même moi,
Frank a trouvé un moyen.
A la Tour Sloan.
Coûte que coûte.
Coûte que coûte.
Manifestation du 29 mai 1997
Ca va, aujourd'hui ?
Tu en veux un ?
C'est fameux.
Vous connaissez ça ?
C'est écrit : ''Sois mienne.''
Pourquoi pas :
''Vous êtes viré'' ?
C'est fini avec Joyce Culmann
et Cynthia Sloan.
Je vous remplace.
Avant l'inauguration ?
Ce serait bête.
Cynthia Sloan
est une grosse cliente.
Bien.
Vous voulez garder Cynthia ?
Occupez-vous de Joyce.
Pourquoi les gens
tombent amoureux ?
Pourquoi les étoiles
brillent la nuit ?
Les gens passent leur vie
à chercher
l'être idéal,
quelqu'un à aimer.
Mais quand ils le trouvent,
tout s'écroule.
C'est un paradoxe.
Maisje crois
qu'il vaut mieux ça
que ne jamais aimer.
Vous pensez que l'amour
vaut la peine qu'on se batte ?
Qu'il vaut tant de souffrance
et d'efforts ?
C'est ce que tu voulais dire
dans le roman pour Mlle Parker ?
Le livre parle de lui-même.
ll y avait en elle un grand vide,
un abîme obscur et silencieux
aussi terrifiant que le palais
qui l'entourait.
Mais au milieu
de ces ténèbres glaciales,
elle aperçut une lumière.
Elle se souvint alors
de la petite fille précoce
au coeur ardent,
à l'âme enflammée de passion
et dont le sourire
transformait l'hiver
en printemps.
Mais la lumière et la flamme
s'étaient éteintes.
Son passé lui avait été volé
par les soldats du palais.
Elle continuerait à chercher,
espérant rallumer le feu.
Jusque-là,
elle serait toujours
triste à la Saint- Valentin.
lci Jarod.
Entrez.
Je n'imaginais pas ça.
On est toujours surpris.
Je vous sers un verre ?
Ca vibre !
On y viendra.
ll n'y a que vous
et moi.
Personne ne nous dérangera.
Surtout pas
votre ennuyeux mari.
Qu'avez-vous ?
Vous êtes ici pour Ca.
Vous pensez à Howard ?
Ce mari ne vous mérite pas.
Tout ce polyester,
c'est d'un goût !
Et ce physique...
Une vraie saucisse sur pattes.
Howard est un peu trapu.
Le père Noël est trapu.
Howard dépasse les bornes.
Howard a ses défauts, mais...
C'est quelqu'un de gentil
et d'humain.
ll vous a offert un grille-pain.
ll a échangé un voyage à Paris
contre une télé.
Un écran de 50 pouces.
C'est Howard tout craché.
Oubliez-le pour la nuit.
On oublie pas 25 ans de mariage
comme ça.
On a un passé.
Une maison ?
Vous avez raison.
On oublie pas 25 ans de mariage
comme ça.
Ni une maison.
ll y a des gens qui passent
toute leur vie
sans avoir de maison.
Je vous raccompagne.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Tu es assis là depuis des heures.
Dis-moi ce qu'il y a.
- Ca ne va pas ?
- Je ne me souviens de rien.
Je n'ai pas de maison !
Sauvez notre maison !
Quelle colère...
lls ne comprennent pas
que c'est dangereux ?
C'est facile, pour vous.
Si cette maison s'écroule,
vous en avez 6 autres.
Mais ils n'ont pas eu
votre éducation,
de riches parents
ou des chevaux.
Les gens changent.
Certains plus que d'autres.
Vous avez vu ?
lls refusent de partir.
lls ne peuvent pas.
J'appelle la police ?
Ca fera bien au JT.
lls désobéissent à la mairie.
Je dis à Alderman Nance
d'appeler la police.
Allez leur parler.
Dites-leur que leur immeuble
est dangereux. En face.
- lls n'écouteront pas.
- Alors, appelez la police.
Déclenchez une émeute.
Coûte que coûte...
On ne partira pas !
Je vous attendais.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Voici Cynthia.
C'est vous qui allez
démolir ma maison ?
Vous aimez les chevaux ?
J'ai trouvé ça ici.
Dans une cachette.
Vous voulez voir ?
Comment vous savez ?
C'est vous.
Vous êtes Cindy.
Comment le saviez-vous ?
On peut trouver à peu près tout,
si on sait où chercher.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Quelqu'un qui croit
que chacun mérite une maison.
Même Cindy Morgan.
Je n'ai pas fait de mal
à ce petit.
Mais vous êtes
en partie responsable.
Pourquoi cet acharnement
à détruire votre maison natale ?
C'est mon passé.
Vous pensiez pouvoir
vous en débarrasser,
comme de votre cicatrice ?
Croyez-moi,
on n'efface pas
ces cicatrices-là.
J'ai essayé.
Parmi toutes les maisons
que je possède,
c'est la seule
où je me sentais chez moi.
Mais vous devez veiller
à votre image.
Quand j'étais petite,
j'ai eu des bourses
pour des écoles très chères.
J'ai fréquenté
des gens très riches.
Pour vous adapter,
vous vous êtes inventé une vie.
Croyez-moi, je sais ce que c'est.
J'ai dit que mon père
élevait des chevaux,
alors qu'en réalité,
il conduisait de riches touristes
dans sa calèche.
Puis mon nom.
Les mensonges s'enchaîînent.
C'est trop tard pour la vérité.
ll n'est jamais trop tard
pour la vérité.
Deux places sur le Concorde.
Je suis le gigolo de votre femme.
J'ai une proposition
à vous faire.
Fêtons votre promotion
sur le toit de Jefferson Heights
C'est génial.
Mauvais cru
de chlorure de soufre.
Que faites-vous ici ?
Je fête quelque chose.
Aujourd'hui, vous êtes viré.
Vous avez
votre parachute doré ?
Accrochez-vous.
Ne tombez pas
avec votre carrière.
Le chlorure de soufre.
ldéal pour démolir
un immeuble
et tuer des enfants.
Mon Dieu ! Aidez-moi.
Vos amis de la mairie
diront que c'était le temps.
Vous avez tué un enfant
pour expulser des gens,
pour vous enrichir.
Vous êtes fou.
Non, Frank.
Vous l'êtes.
C'est ici que Michael
a fait une chute mortelle,
comme vous allez le faire.
Aidez-moi, Jarod.
Je n'en peux plus.
Vous avez aidé Michael ?
J'ai de l'argent !
Navré. Je ne suis pas
vraiment gigolo.
On ne m'achète pas.
Mais par curiosité, combien ?
Combien pour expulser
des centaines de gens ?
Combien pour tuer
un enfant innocent ?
D'accord, Jarod. Je l'ai fait.
Je l'ai fait.
Maintenant, aidez-moi.
Jolie montre.
Ne perdez pas votre temps
avec ça.
Croyez-moi.
Vous savez divertir une dame.
Vous n'avez rien vu.
ll va voler ?
On va voir.
Je vais filmer ça.
J'ai le droit ?
Je n'ai pas envie
de rentrer seule.
Je m'y sens seule.
C'est l'heure.
Alors, on discute des projets
de rénovation ?
Coûte que coûte.
J'arrive.
Quoi ?
ll vaut mieux
perdre un amour
que ne jamais avoir aimé.
Tu es d'accord ?
Si tu te sens seul,
fais le 3615.
Tu as lu mon livre ?
En diagonale.
C'est très triste.
J'écris les choses
commeje les vois.
Pourquoi on finit comme ça ?
- Comment ?
- Seuls.
En quête.
C'est ironique.
On veut la même chose.
Quelqu'un à chérir...
qui nous chérisse.
Tu crois qu'on trouvera
un tel amour ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux de moi ?
Ouvre le paquet.
Sois mon amoureuse

Vu dans Le Caméléon :
Je pense souvent à maman.
Moi aussi. Chaquejour.
Contrairement à tous ici,
je ne crains pas votre père.
Tout a changé
depuis qu'ils sont là.
Pointez un flingue sur moi.
Vous n'aurez pas
le cran de tirer.
Vous allez tirer ?
La cafétéria est fermée ?
Le Centre est évacué
pour l'alerte incendie.
Alors, pourquoi jouer avec le feu ?
Pardon ?
Si vous devez travailler pour moi,
vous devez savoir trois choses.
La 1 re :
arrangez votre cravate.
La 2e :
changez-en.
Et la 3e ?
Les bonbons : pour les clients.
- Quoi ?
- Te voilà, mon coeur.
Papa.
- C'est toi ?
- Sauf si tu as
un autre père.
J'ai appelé chez toi.
Que fais-tu au Centre
ce dimanche entre tous ?
Une fausse alerte sur Jarod.
Où es-tu ?
Je rentre en hélico à Blue Cove.
Et tes vacances ?
La plage ne me disait rien.
Je sais quel jour on est.
Je pense beaucoup à ta mère.
- Vraiment ?
- Ca te surprend ?
C'est la première fois
que tu m'appelles ce jour-là.
A mon âge,
on est rongé de remords.
ll y a beaucoup de choses
que je veux te dire, et lui dire,
depuis longtemps.
Je suis là. Je t'attends.
J'arrive à 1 9 h.
J'allais partir
au cimetière, mais on pourrait
aller voir maman ensemble.
Pour une fois, nous serons
tous les 3. Attends-moi.
Je serai chez moi.
Tu me manques, maman.
L'anniversaire de la mort
d'un parent est lourd à porter,
surtout seul.
Voulez-vous ma compagnie
au cimetière ?
Merci, je n'irai pas seule
cette année.
Votre père ?
Je vais sur la tombe de ma mère
chaque année depuis sa mort.
Mon père ne voulait pas en parler.
Pourquoi les gens attendent
la fin de leur vie avant...
d'affronter leurs remords ?
Le remords vient
d'une émotion enfouie.
La mort de votre mère
est une blessure.
Une blessure que même un Parker
ne peut ignorer à jamais.
Vous ne l'avez jamais vu
la pleurer ?
Jusqu'au jour
où vous la pleurerez ensemble,
la blessure ne guérira jamais.
Fille... triste.
Tiens, tiens !
Qui voilà ?
On vole des fournitures ?
J'étudie vos tentatives
pour capturer Jarod.
Pas joli joli.
Mettez un peu de couleur.
Vous faites pitié.
- Papa ?
- Tu lui as parlé
aujourd'hui ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
- T'aider.
- Où es-tu ?
- Je quitte
- Blue Cove. Pourquoi ?
- Fais demi-tour
et retourne au Centre
en vitesse.
Pourquoi ?
Quelqu'un va tuer ton père.
On m'a enlevé à ma famille.
Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà
plus doué que les autres.
Combien de gens sont morts
à cause de moi ?
Depuis mon évasion,
je cherche mon passé.
C'est un Caméléon.
Un génie qui peut devenir
qui il veut.
- Le Centre le veut vivant.
- De préférence.
ll défend les opprimés.
La vie est un don.
Vous êtes médecin ?
Aujourd'hui, oui.
On a donné l'ordre de le tuer.
D'après ma source, le dossier
''Arkham'' dans l'unité centrale
expliquerait tout.
- C'est pas un jour pour jouer.
- Je sais queljour on est.
Le Centre t'a pris ta mère
comme il m'a pris à la mienne.
Ne les laisse pas tuer ton père.
Mon père t'a enfermé
toute ta vie.
Pourquoi veux-tu l'aider ?
Parce que s'il meurt,
mes réponses meurent avec lui.
Et les tiennes aussi.
Je ne sais pas si c'est bien.
M. Conte, j'ai parlé
aux conseillers de Chris.
Grimper lui fera du bien,
mentalement et physiquement.
Je veux bien croire
aux vertus de la randonnée,
mais depuis l'accident de voiture,
on a essayé les retraites,
les excursions, tout.
Je veux retrouver mon Chris.
Je suis là pour ça.
ll a perdu son ami.
ll lui faut du temps.
Vous parlez d'expérience ?
Je ne lâcherai pas votre fils.
Jarod Crockett.
Faut faire vite si on veut arriver
avant les autres.
Prêt à escalader ce monstre ?
Prêt à rentrer chez moi.
Je serais mieux chez moi.
Le dossier Arkham.
Concentrez-vous.
Ce serait plus pratique
en salle des machines.
C'est là qu'ils chercheront.
Qui ? Y a personne.
Ceux qui veulent
tuer mon père.
- Désolé.
- Maintenant, vous savez.
D'accord. Arkham.
- Et votre père ?
- Pas de téléphone
ni de radio dans l'hélico.
ll atterrit sur le toit de la Tour
dans 4 h.
Quand il a appelé,
il faisait un pas vers moi.
Attention, Parker.
ll vous a déjà déçue.
Vous étiez là quand on a tué ma mère.
Est-ce que vous l'avez vu...
La pleurer ?
Dites-moi.
Un peu après,
il m'a dit de ne jamais en parler.
Ni à vous ni à Jarod.
A personne.
ll m'a dit de reprendre le travail.
Et puis...
Quoi ?
ll m'a dit : ''La vie continue.''
Fille triste.
Tout le monde triste.
Fille triste.
Cette boussole est faussée.
On est perdus.
Tu as raison.
En tout cas, c'est pas ma faute.
Tu dois m'indiquer nos positions.
En tant qu'équipe,
on doit communiquer.
Vous autres, guides,
vous me gonflez tous.
On te ''gonfle'' ?
Vous voulez que je communique,
que je parle.
J'ai pas besoin d'aide.
Tu n'as pas à vivre ça seul.
Grimpons, d'accord ?
Ca ne sera peut-être pas si dur.
''La Jeep est morte.
Je vais au garage.''
Tu penses comme moi ?
Un raccourci.
On la démarre, on suit la piste
et on les bat tous.
Je sais pas.
On ira plus vite.
Ce sera notre secret.
Tu sais garder les secrets.
Ca y est !
J'ai Arkham.
Arkham ?
Que faites-vous ici ?
J'habite ici.
Soufflez un mot,
je vous descends.
- Y a un hic.
- Ouvrez le dossier.
ll y a une alarme.
Si je l'ouvre, ça préviendra...
Celui qui a donné l'ordre
saura qu'on est là.
ll sait déjà. Ouvrez-le !
Ca s'encode.
- C'est du charabia.
- Vous avez lu ?
Neutralisation, 1 900 heures.
1 9 h.
L'heure où votre père
doit atterrir
sur le toit de la Tour.
Alors ?
Vous allez assassiner mon père ?
Je ne suis pas au courant.
Espèce d'enfoiré !
Nous sommes tous dans le noir,
Mlle Parker.
Ni ordinateur, ni téléphone,
ni électricité.
Les portes sont verrouillées.
Sous-sol bloqué.
Destiné à protéger le Centre
contre le nucléaire.
Ou d'une révolution de palais
contre mon père. Débloquez-nous.
lmpossible.
Je ne vais pas rester coincée
comme un de vos cobayes.
Je suis piégé aussi.
Je n'ai presque plus d'oxygène.
Me ferais-je Ca à moi-même ?
Ceux qui veulent tuer votre père
vous savent ici.
lls viendront vous chercher.
Raines n'a pas tort.
Le blocage est lié
à l'alerte incendie ?
ll n'y a pas d'alerte, crétin !
C'est pour évacuer.
Nosferatu a dû mettre
un sniper là-haut.
Je ne crois pas que Raines
soit lié à ça.
Réveillez-vous, Sydney.
ll est derrière tout.
Vous pouvez rouvrir
le dossier Arkham ?
Je l'ai sur disquette.
En quelques heures...
Dans moins de 2 h,
mon père est mort !
Du calme, Parker.
Broots fait de son mieux.
Les ascenseurs sont peut-être
sur générateur.
Hayes.
- Qui ?
- Mon nouveau nettoyeur.
Je lui ai laissé un message
pour qu'il vienne au labo de simu
si je ne l'appelais pas
dans l'heure.
C'est maintenant.
On est sauvés.
S'il a eu mon message.
La devise des Parker :
ne compte que sur toi-même.
Le labo de simu.
lci Hayes.
lmpossible d'avoir le Centre.
Essayez encore.
Essayez maintenant.
ll va falloir pousser.
Je vais embrayer.
Pousse fort.
Tu pourras ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Prêt ?
- Jarod ?
- Les freins !
Le chauffage
traverse tous les sous-sols
jusqu'au hall d'entrée.
Tragique
et ironique.
Le jour du suicide de votre mère.
De son assassinat.
Ne parlez pas d'elle.
Je vous en prie,
sortez-moi de là.
Je vais te sortir de là.
Ca va ?
Pourquoi ça n'iraitpas ?
Je ne t'ai pas vue depuis...
ce qui est arrivé à ta mère.
Elle s'est tuée.
Elle était malade.
ll s'appelle comment ?
Angelo.
ll est spécial.
J'arrive pas à lui parler.
J'y arriverai peut-être.
Cracker Jack ?
Tu ne connais pas ?
ll y a une surprise.
Une surprise dans la nourriture ?
Surprise !
- Vous avez réussi.
- Et l'ascenseur ?
J'ai trouvé des outils,
et regardez.
Des talkies-walkies.
Mon père atterrit dans 90 mn.
Et Arkham ?
Ca prendra bien 3 h.
ll a encore moins de temps.
Je reste avec Raines.
Son pouls est faible.
Si on n'a pas appelé dans 20 mn,
oubliez M. Propre et filez.
Vous êtes ma sécurité,
si on est coincés.
Comment ça ''coincés'' ?
Arrière.
Restez ici.
Arrêtez ou vous êtes mort.
Respirez.
- Qui c'était ?
- Des nettoyeurs.
Je les connais pas.
Allons-y.
- Qu'est-il arrivé ?
- La Jeep...
- Ca fait mal ?
- Quand je cligne des yeux.
Je dois vous tirer de là.
J'ai la jambe cassée.
Va chercher de l'aide.
Si on ne rentre pas,
ils vont lancer des recherches.
J'ai peut-être une hémorragie.
Vas-y.
Grimpe cette falaise.
ll doit y avoir une route.
Je ne peux pas !
On est à l'ascenseur.
Quoi ?
C'est l'impact d'une balle.
lls l'ont pas bouché
depuis le temps ?
C'est le Centre.
lls font passer un message.
Tu dois y aller.
ll faut chercher de l'aide.
Je ne peux pas !
Si, tu peux.
C'est lié à ton accident ?
A la mort de ton meilleur ami ?
Ecoute-moi.
Les accidents arrivent.
Des gens meurent.
- C'est pas un secret.
- Pourquoi vous dites ça ?
Parce que je peux t'aider.
Laisse-moi t'aider.
Nick voulait prendre un raccourci.
ll allait trop vite.
On s'est retournés.
Le volant lui est rentré dedans.
Et après ?
Les flics sont venus.
Sa voiture brûlait.
J'étais dehors
et Nick était dedans.
ll est mort sur le coup.
Tu n'y es pour rien.
Non, justement.
Je l'ai laissé mourir !
Je l'ai laissé mourir.
Ca va vous plaire.
J'ai eu un de ces...
chocs parentaux
au petit-déjeuner.
Le temps passe vite.
Ma Debbie m'a dit
ce qu'elle veut être plus tard.
Elle a dix ans.
Enfin, bref...
Vous avez pensé partir ?
Du Centre. Partir ?
Emmener Debbie et partir...
ailleurs.
- Souvent.
- Faites-le.
Ne faites pas attention
aux autres.
Ne vous laissez pas berner
par la sécurité de l'immobilisme.
Si vous en ressentez le besoin,
alors, faites-le.
Faites-le pour Debbie.
Mais faites-le maintenant.
Parce que le prochain ascenseur...
Je n'ai pas connu votre mère,
Mlle Parker...
Je suis sûr que ses choix
étaient liés à sa petite fille.
Debbie veut faire quoi, plus tard ?
Elle dit qu'elle veut être
comme vous.
Ca y est.
On monte vers le hall.
Attendez-moi.
Coucou.
J'en ai marre de vous.
ll ne fallait pas
consulter l'unité centrale.
Où sont Broots et Sydney ?
Les Stooges vont toujours par trois.
Au fait,
les alertes d'incendie,
c'est pour les lycéens.
On peut toujours essayer.
Si vous étiez au cimetière,
à pleurnicher comme vous devriez,
vous ne seriez pas dans ce pétrin.
ll est temps de boucler la boucle.
Vous allez mourir dans l'ascenseur,
comme maman !
S'il y a un endroit
où je ne mourrai pas, c'est ici.
Vous êtes touchée !
La balle a ricoché.
Oui, sur mon bras !
C'est rien.
Bougez pas !
Où on est ?
Au niveau souterrain 26.
Bien joué.
J'entends un bruit.
Attendez. Ne sortez pas.
Tenez.
Je veux la tuer, pas la dévisser.
Vous avez mieux ?
Je vous couvre.
Ca me rassure.
Vous pensiez
partir avec un lâche ?
C'est ce que tu es ?
Ce que Nick penserait de toi ?
Comment ça s'est passé ?
On était dans la voiture.
Je me suis réveillé à l'envers.
J'ai regardé...
Nick était coincé
sous le volant.
ll y avait du sang partout.
ll me regardait.
L'air effrayé.
ll me suppliait de l'aider.
Puis, le feu a commencé...
et la fumée.
J'étais cloué sur place.
Je vois encore ses yeux.
Tu as fait quoi ?
Je suis sorti de la voiture.
J'ai rampé plus loin.
Les flammes grandissaient.
Je l'entendais m'appeler.
J'aurais dû brûler.
J'aurais dû mourir.
Nick était coincé
dans la voiture.
Tu ne pouvais pas le sauver.
Parce que j'ai fui !
Si tu étais resté, tu serais mort.
Ta réaction était humaine.
J'ai fui !
Je connais ce sentiment.
J'ai vu mon frère mourir
dans un accident de voiture.
Chaque jour, je m'en veux.
Je pense
à ce que j'aurais pu faire.
Mais avec le temps,
il m'a pardonné.
J'entends sa voix,
comme tu entends celle de Nick.
Que voudrait-il que tu fasses ?
Attention !
Vous avez entendu ?
Je suis officiellement en enfer.
Donnez-moi ça.
Où en est le dossier Arkham ?
Deux heures.
Mon père arrive dans 1 h.
Ramenez-moi dans le hall.
Fameux.
Fameux.
Fille...
triste.
Ta mère te manque ?
C'est elle qui me donnait ça.
Je suis seule avec mon père.
ll travaille tout le temps.
Ma mère et moi, on parlait.
Elle brossait mes cheveux
ou on lisait des histoires.
Je n'ai plus ma mère.
Maisje lui parle.
Sa voix est en moi.
Comme la sienne est en toi.
Maman.
Faire mal à maman.
Papa.
Faire mal à papa.
Fille triste.
Attends !
Pas touche !
ll l'accélère.
Golden Hawk tomber.
ll n'y a pas de sniper.
Elle a saboté l'hélico.
Golden Hawk...
tomber.
C'est un détonateur à distance.
- Quoi ?
- Un détonateur.
Quand l'hélico arrive
à 30 m de la Tour,
une bombe explose,
l'hélico perd le contrôle
et s'écrase.
Et ça passe pour un accident.
Exactement.
Cadeau surprise.
J'ai dit que j'en voulais pas.
Surprise !
C'est un DSA.
Daté du jour de la mort
de ma mère.
- Où est Jarod ?
- On l'a ramené
dans sa cellule.
Qu'est-il arrivé à Catherine ?
Ma femme était très malade.
Elle avait des soucis, oui.
Mais un suicide ?
Ne parlez de cet incident à
personne.
Jamais.
Pas à Jarod.
Et surtoutpas à ma fille.
Rentrez chez vous, maintenant.
Soyez dans ce laboratoire demain,
prêt au travail.
La vie continue, Sydney.
La vie continue.
Papa triste.
ll faut sauver papa.
Finissons-en.
La trappe de la chaufferie
est par là.
Où êtes-vous ?
Au souterrain 26,
direction la chaufferie.
Faites vite.
Votre père arrive dans 30 mn.
Comme si je le savais pas !
Par ici.
Ca monte jusqu'au hall.
Pourvu que j'arrive à temps.
Tout est en place.
A 30 mn
du point de détonation.
Tu es prêt ?
Je crois.
Reviens vite.
- Je viens avec vous ?
- J'irai plus vite seule.
26 étages en 1 5 mn !
Vous y arriverez ?
Vous avez le code du générateur ?
Bonne chance.
Je suis dans le hall.
Hayes est mort.
Raines va pas tarder.
Je le branche
à l'oxygène du Centre.
Mettez le courant.
- Donnez-lui l'appareil.
- Le temps presse.
Faites-le !
Vous voulez tuer mon père ?
Non.
Alors, qui ?
Ceux qui ont tué votre mère.
Qui ?
ll tourne de l'oeil.
Mlle Parker, vous avez 5 mn.
Le Centre est en vue, enfin.
Coucou !
Vous ne renoncez jamais.
Laissez tomber l'accent.
Ca prend plus.
D'accord, garce !
C'était chiant !
Les Parker,
vous achevez jamais rien.
Vous avez l'air achevée.
Ca va ?
Oui. Nick serait fier.
ll me l'a dit.
Merci.
Ton père t'attend.
Désolé pour la fausse alerte.
Votre jambe est cassée.
Je mange plein de glaces.
Le calcium.
C'est sain.
On s'occupera de Brigitte.
N'en parlons pas maintenant.
C'est magnifique, ici.
Tu n'es jamais revenu ?
Pas depuis l'enterrement.
Je ne pouvais pas l'affronter.
Tous les ans, on viendra
ensemble.
ll y a des choses
que je veux te dire...
Tu n'as rien à me dire.
Je suis heureuse que tu sois là.
Ca va ?
La vie continue.
Je suis contentpour ton père.
Merci, Jarod.
Elle te manque ?
Oui.
Tu lui manques aussi.
Comment le sais-tu ?
Lis la carte.
Sa voix est en toi

NlCE FELLOw
Je vous le jure,
je deviens folle.
On rate Jarod d'un cheveu
chaque fois.
Mais lŗ, en plus,
on se trompe de ville.
Ca reviendra.
On a tous des baisses de rťgime.
On est au Centre, Broots.
Pas de ''baisse de rťgime''.
Ca fait un bail.
La vie te traite bien ?
Comme si j'avais couchť
avec son mari.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Pourquoi M. Lyle me suit ?
ll m'a traquť ŗ Albuquerque
et ŗ Santa Fe.
ll va devoir renoncer au stop.
Au stop ?
On lui a coupť un pouce.
Dis-nous oý tu es.
On peut te protťger.
J'apprťcie, mais j'ai l'habitude
de me dťbrouiller seul.
Je dois y aller.
Le boulot m'attend.
Salut, Joey.
- Qui c'est ?
- Un nouveau.
- On est prÍts ?
- Mon fric.
Bobby ?
Une beautť, pas vrai ?
Les plaques seront lŗ dans 3 jours.
Ca va pas ?
C'est comme une cheville ronde
dans un trou carrť.
Tu cadres pas.
Un cadavre,
Áa veut dire les flics.
Et un tťmoin,
Áa veut dire des ennuis.
J'ai apportť les plaques.
J'ai ťtť rťglo.
Tue-le. Ca caille.
Joey, c'est pas malin.
ll a raison.
Fais-le, toi.
Vas-y, montre-moi que t'en as.
Vas-y !
Vas-y !
Ou je te colle un pruneau.
On l'appelle pas
Bobby 2 Flingues pour rien.
C'est pas bien, Joey.
D'accord, mais sur les quais.
Non, fais-le ici.
Allez, l'as de Chicago.
Joey, j'ai des gosses.
- On priera pour eux.
- J'ai une famille !
Fais pas Áa !
Tue-le !
Vas-y !
On m'a enlevť ŗ ma famille.
Au bout de 36 h, il semble dťjŗ
plus douť que les autres.
Combien de gens sont morts
ŗ cause de moi ?
Depuis mon ťvasion,
je cherche mon passť.
C'est un Camťlťon.
Un gťnie qui peut devenir
qui il veut.
- Le Centre le veut vivant.
- De prťfťrence.
ll dťfend les opprimťs.
La vie est un don.
Vous Ítes mťdecin ?
Aujourd'hui, oui.
- Petit-dťjeuner ?
- On se casse. Ca pue.
Bien visť, vieux.
Joli coup.
Un corps trouvť dans un entrepŰt
Ca roule ?
On a fait combien, hier ?
Je sais pas.
900 $ et des poussiŤres.
ll pleuvait.
Veille ŗ ce que Áa arrive ŗ 22 h.
Je veux plus de plaintes.
- Je dois payer le loyer.
- Paie-le.
Allons dans mon bureau.
Chouette dťcoration !
Le FBl nous entend pas,
avec le gel.
Si c'est pour hier,
j'ťtais surpris.
Ca n'arrivera plus.
C'ťtait juste un test.
Tu n'exploites pas ton talent
ŗ fond.
D'aprŤs Fat Tony, y a pas
meilleur faussaire que toi.
Un vrai artiste, il dit.
Je lui ai fait 1 million de $.
ll peut parler.
Fais voir.
Pardon ?
Fais voir ce que t'as.
Lequel est vrai ?
Les deux sont vrais.
Je dois Ítre un artiste.
Tu crois que je sais pas
qui tu es ?
De quoi tu parles ?
Raconte-moi
ce qui s'est passť ŗ Chicago.
J'imprimais des billets
pour Tony T.
Et Áa ? Regarde.
Jarod Puzzo.
Condamnť pour incendie criminel,
racket, escroquerie.
Mandats d'arrÍt... Je continue ?
J'ai violť ma conditionnelle.
Je voulais me faire oublier.
J'avais pas besoin
qu'un tocard me balance.
ll y a quelques mois,
le FBl nous a infiltrťs.
Ca craint.
D'aprŤs un ami, ils peuvent
nous citer ŗ comparaÓÓtre.
Je te rappelle que Áa s'est passť
avant que j'arrive.
T'as rťponse ŗ tout, pas vrai ?
Plus de secrets.
L'artiste...
Un agent anti-corruption
mort ťtouffť
Un de ses coťquipiers
inculpť du meurtre
Un ancien combattant
dťshonorť par son fils
ll paraÓÓt que c'est urgent.
J'ai reÁu cette vidťo-surveillance
du siŤge de Hartford.
Tu connais le tireur ?
On le connaÓÓt tous les deux.
M. Lyle.
Jarod nous a dit
que Lyle le suivait.
Aux derniŤres nouvelles,
il traitait avec les yakusa.
Dťcidťment yakusa.
Les yakusa fautifs
se font couper le petit doigt.
ll a fait quoi
pour perdre un pouce ?
ll l'a bien mťritť.
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il prťpare ?
ll sait que nos bureaux
sont surveillťs.
ll a dťbranchť la 1 re camťra.
On sait que tous nos employťs
sont morts,
y compris le directeur
administratif, M. Strum.
Lyle.
Va nettoyer Áa.
Je ne suis plus nettoyeuse.
Ma mission est de trouver Jarod.
Si Lyle est aprŤs Jarod,
alors Áa devient ta mission.
ll faut savoir
ce qu'il cherchait.
C'est une...
situation trŤs dťlicate.
Tu es la seule en qui j'ai confiance.
L'agent Dean Clark a ťtť arrÍtť
pour le meurtre
de Lester Knight.
Nous avons interrogť Sean
Flanagan, qui instruit l'affaire.
Pensez-vous
que Dean Clark ait tuť
l'agent Knight ?
L'agent Clark est inculpť
du meurtre d'un de ses coťquipiers
avec qui il avait infiltrť
le clan Molino.
Je n'ai rien ŗ ajouter.
Un ancien combattant
dťshonorť par son fils
C'est pour lui que j'ai rejoint
la brigade anti-corruption.
Vous avez bu
avec un associť de Joey Molino
le soir oý Les Knight est mort.
Bobby 2 Flingues.
Le bras droit de Molino.
On l'appelle ''2 Flingues''
ŗ cause de sa paire de .38.
Je l'ai dit ŗ mon avocat.
Vous communiquez pas ?
Vous ťtiez avec Bobby
la nuit du meurtre de Knight ?
J'avais pour mission
de suivre 2 Flingues.
Au restau de Faye, il m'a dťfiť
de boire une bouteille de gin.
J'ai commencť ŗ boire,
ŗ dťconner...
Et l'agent Knight m'appelle.
Quelqu'un de chez nous
tuyautait Molino.
- ll a dit qui ?
- Non.
ll m'a dit de faire gaffe.
Et le lendemain, on le retrouvait
ťtouffť
dans un sac de teinturier ?
Votre teinturier.
On m'a piťgť.
Bobby et moi,
on a descendu la bouteille.
Je me rappelle pas Ítre parti.
J'aurais pas pu conduire
jusque chez Knight,
le tuer et rentrer chez moi
sans me payer un poteau.
On m'a piťgť, je vous dis.
Les plaques arrivent du Costa Rica.
Deux tailles : 20 et 1 00 dollars.
Y aura du boulot dessus.
T'es un artiste.
ll me faut du matťriel.
- Tu sais oý te fournir ?
- Bien sŻr.
- Ca va douiller.
- T'inquiŤte pas pour Áa.
AprŤs ce coup,
on sera tous plein au as.
Joey, tťlťphone.
- Qui c'est ?
- Je demande ?
Non, passe-le-moi.
Sers-moi un Gibson.
Je reviens.
C'est waikiki ?
On voit la TÍte de Diamant.
ll paraÓÓt que c'est beau.
Je devais y aller en lune de miel.
Ca s'est pas fait.
Une fille comme vous
dans un endroit pareil...
J'ai pas les moyens d'aller ŗ HawaÔ.
Vendez tout et allez-y !
Joey a tout dilapidť.
Je n'ai pas de capital.
Comment vous avez atterri avec lui ?
A la mort de mon mari,
j'ai repris le restaurant,
mais j'ai eu des problŤmes d'argent.
Joey a proposť son aide.
Grosse erreur.
On y va !
C'est vous qui devriez l'ťviter,
tant que vous le pouvez.
- On en fait quoi ?
- Rien. lls n'existent plus.
Vous revoilŗ nettoyeuse ?
Ca m'ťtonne.
Mon pŤre a ses raisons.
- On cherche quoi ?
- Des trucs dťplacťs ou manquants.
Lyle n'a pas fait un tel coup
pour rien.
ll doit y avoir quelque chose.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Une puce E-prong.
En gťnťral, elle est fixťe
sur la BoÓÓte Bleue.
Chaque bureau du Centre est connectť
ŗ une unitť centrale
qu'on appelle BoÓÓte Bleue.
Ces puces ne peuvent pas tomber.
Les BoÓÓtes Bleues sont scellťes.
Comme Áa ?
Ca doit Ítre Ca.
?
D'aprŤs un ami,
1 0 palettes de papier monnaie
sont entreposťes ŗ Brooklyn
pour une nuit.
Cette nuit.
Tu veux voler
le ministŤre des Finances ?
Avec ce papier,
personne ne distinguera nos billets
des vrais.
Picasso ne peignait pas sur du PQ.
Fais-moi confiance.
J'ai dit un truc drŰle ?
''Fais-moi confiance.''
C'est la derniŤre chose
que Knight m'a dite, lŗ oý tu es.
T'as refroidi ce flic ici ?
On l'a enfermť ici.
ll a ťtouffť avant de geler.
J'ai perdu mon pari
contre 2 Flingues.
Mais mort, c'est mort, pas vrai ?
ll avait pas un sac sur la tÍte ?
J'ai fait Áa...
pour piťger l'autre flic.
Moi aussi, je suis un artiste.
Allez, Picasso, monte le coup.
Y a assez de papier
pour 1 million de $ !
Bien jouť, Picasso !
Le gardien change dans 20 mn.
Les flics arrivent.
Comment tu le sais ?
ll le sait.
Cassons-nous !
Les mains en l'air !
FBl. Je vous arrÍte.
Pas un geste !
Couchťs !
Bas les pattes.
- lls embarquent Bobby.
- Tu devais me cogner ?
T'as pas pris de balle.
Gilet ou pas,
je sens encore le Ronron.
Tu as baignť longtemps ?
Le teinturier refuse mes fringues.
Laissez-les.
Plus j'ai de bleus,
moins ils poseront de questions.
On met la pression
sur les gens de Chicago.
Si Joey t'a repťrť, je te retire.
On veut pas perdre un autre agent.
Je suis trop prŤs du but.
Pourquoi cette fausse descente ?
Molino sait tout avant nous.
ll y a une fuite.
Et ?
ll a reÁu un appel
et a filť avant votre arrivťe.
CoÔncidence ?
ll y a un mouchard chez nous.
Et de taille.
Vous avez pas braquť un colporteur,
mais le ministŤre des Finances.
Je vous l'ai dit,
on allait voir des potes
et on s'est perdus.
Flanagan, on a deux tÍtes de mule.
Comment vous le savez ?
Qui a l'air bÍte ?
Nous,
ou ceux qui ont perdu 2 agents ?
Vous savez ce qui vous attend ?
Vingt ans.
C'est Dean Clark
qui va prendre 20 ans.
Quelle dťception, pour vous !
Ma raison de vivre,
c'est de coincer Joey Molino.
Alors faites les malins.
Cette fois, je gagne.
La partie n'est pas finie.
Vous plaisantez ?
L'avocat de Molino est chez le juge.
On aurait oubliť de leur lire
leurs droits.
Rel‚chez-les.
Vous m'avez entendu.
On dirait que vous avez perdu.
J'ai fait un diagnostic.
ll manque bel et bien une puce.
Pas moyen de savoir
quelles donnťes elle contenait ?
lmpossible de savoir
ce qu'il y avait dessus.
Encore moins
ce qu'il n'y avait pas.
Rien n'est impossible.
Continuez.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť ?
L'ami d'un ami a montť le coup.
Mais il a violť sa conditionnelle.
Alors il a jouť sur les 2 tableaux
pour pas retourner en taule.
Ca aurait pu mieux se passer,
mais on a assez de papier.
Et l'ami de l'ami ?
Disons qu'il ne parlera plus
ŗ personne.
Et j'envoie un petit cadeau
ŗ sa femme.
C'est une langue ?
Le papier qu'on a est bon.
Tout va bien se passer.
J'y compte bien.
- J'ai un truc pour toi aussi.
- Sa cervelle ?
Mieux que Áa.
Pour fÍter ta sortie du violon.
C'est bien ce que tu bois ?
ll est incroyable !
- Merci.
- Je t'en prie.
Toutes les BoÓÓtes Bleues
contiennent des donnťes sensibles.
ll ne faut pas qu'elles tombent
en de mauvaises mains.
Lyle savait qu'il en obtiendrait
un bon prix,
que Áa lui permettrait
de revenir au Centre.
C'est pour Áa qu'il faut
s'occuper de lui dťfinitivement.
ll faut rťgler ce problŤme,
mais en jouant serrť.
Tu veux que je le fasse ?
Papa ?
Je ne suis pas une meurtriŤre.
Tu feras le nťcessaire.
J'ai dŻ lutter
pour regagner mon poste.
Et Lyle me fait paraÓÓtre inefficace.
Mon ange, nous devons
nous protťger l'un l'autre.
Si tu ne me protŤges pas,
je ne pourrai pas te protťger.
Je rentre chez moi,
pour finir mon cadeau.
- A demain.
- A plus.
Autre chose ?
Une vodka, si vous m'accompagnez.
- Essayez.
- J'y vais.
Pas celle-ci. Joey la coupe.
La bonne est au congťlo.
Attendez...
Merci, trŤs peu pour moi.
Je ne veux rien boire
de l'endroit
oý ce flic est mort.
Comment Áa ?
Joey m'a dit
qu'il l'avait butť lŗ-dedans.
Vous ne saviez pas ?
Ce soir-lŗ,
Joey m'a fait fermer tŰt.
Je pensais...
J'imaginais pas
qu'ils avaient tuť quelqu'un.
Et Dean Clark ? Le flic
accusť du meurtre de Knight,
il ťtait lŗ ?
ll ťtait au bar,
ŗ boire du gin avec Bobby.
ll ťtait bourrť.
lls ont dŻ le porter pour sortir.
Ca va ?
Je commence ŗ ouvrir les yeux.
Un flic est mort
et un innocent va Ítre exťcutť.
Bon sang...
Comment j'en suis arrivťe lŗ ?
Et comment je vais m'en sortir ?
Le fichier central.
lci l'officier 557E.
J'aimerais une copie des demandes
d'extrait du casier de Jarod Puzzo.
Je patiente.
Qui ?
C'est tout
ce que je voulais savoir.
J'ai besoin de monnaie
pour les clients.
Continue de parler
et ta tÍte finira sur le mur
ŗ cŰtť de ta photo de HawaÔ.
Je rÍve !
RťpŤte !
Les clients.
Tu veux que l'argent rentre, non ?
Oý est Bobby ?
ll vient pas aujourd'hui.
ll est scotchť aux w.-c.
Un truc qu'il a bu.
Quelle loque !
Et je dois partir.
Je peux faire ta livraison.
Sois pas en retard pour le cadeau.
- Sois lŗ-bas ŗ 22 h.
- Pas de problŤme.
Je veux pas recevoir de plainte.
Bonsoir, M. Flanagan.
Oý est Bobby ?
ProblŤmes de plomberie.
La tÍte de mule du commissariat...
Vous fiez pas
ŗ la 1 re impression.
Dites ŗ Joey
que pour maintenir notre accord,
il me faut plus de fric.
J'ai des gens ŗ payer.
- Je comprends.
- Bien.
Veillez-y.
Certainement.
Veillez ŗ ce que Broots
reste concentrť sur Jarod.
Vous le connaissez.
C'est un exemple vivant
d'ťtourderie chronique.
ll vous a demandť de faire quoi ?
C'est moi qui dis ŗ Broots
quoi faire.
Votre pŤre.
Peu importe.
Je ne vous crois pas.
Lyle apparaÓÓt et soudain,
vous revoilŗ nettoyeuse.
Que vous a-t-il demandť
de faire ?
De rťgler la situation.
De le tuer ?
Lyle aura ce qu'il mťrite.
Vous avez l'air
d'y croire.
J'y crois.
Quel nom ?
Lyle est dans un hŰtel
ŗ Providence.
Qu'allez-vous faire ?
Rťgler la situation.
Et ensuite ?
Je rentrerai
et je dormirai comme un bťbť.
Echec.
Mat.
Je t'avais prťvenu.
- La place est prise.
- Eugene Clark ?
Peut-Ítre.
Je suis un ami de Dean.
Vous Ítes culottť
de venir ici comme Áa.
C'est illťgal de frapper
un agent fťdťral.
Un agent fťdťral ?
Vous travailliez avec Dean ?
Non.
Mais je sais qu'il vous respecte.
ll serait incapable de vous blesser.
Je ne suis pas pŤre.
Mais je suis un fils,
et je connais
les sentiments qu'ťprouve un fils.
On veut devenir comme son pŤre...
gagner sa fiertť.
Je pensais Áa de Dean.
Depuis 3 mois,
je me remets en question.
Vous avez fait au mieux.
Je dois y aller.
Dean est un bon flic.
Ne le l‚chez pas.
Lyle est dans un hŰtel
ŗ Providence.
Qu'allez-vous faire ?
Qu'allez-vous faire ?
ll faut s'occuper de lui
dťfinitivement.
Qu'allez-vous faire ?
Je ne suis pas une meurtriŤre.
ll faut s'occuper de lui
dťfinitivement.
Dťfinitivement.
Qu'allez-vous faire ?
- Je ne suis pas une meurtriŤre.
- Tu feras le nťcessaire.
Si proche etpourtant si loin.
C'est devenu votre devise, non ?
- M. Lyle.
- Ne soyez pas dťÁue.
Jarod vous ťchappe, alors moi...
Vous Ítes enrhumť ?
ll fait humide, oý vous Ítes.
C'est temporaire.
Nous voulons la puce.
lmpossible, si je veux garder
mes autres doigts.
Excusez-moi, j'ai rendez-vous
avec un acheteur.
Vingt millions de dollars.
Vive le RÍve amťricain !
Vous avez laissť un indice.
Centre nautique de Hillman,
il n'y a personne
pour vous rťpondre.
Hillman, Áa vous dit
quelque chose ?
C'est lŗ que le Centre
stocke ses donnťes informatiques.
Le vendredi soir ŗ 23 h 59,
tous les bureaux du Centre
sauvegardent les donnťes
des BoÓÓtes Bleues
dans cet ordinateur gťant.
Les BoÓÓtes Bleues...
Lyle tenterait d'infiltrer le dťpŰt ?
Pourquoi le ferait-il ?
Pour la dťcrypter.
De quoi vous parlez ?
La puce volťe est protťgťe
par un code inviolable.
Mais s'il rťussit
ŗ la connecter ŗ l'ordinateur
du dťpŰt,
ŗ 23 h 59...
Ce soir !
Ce soir, au moment
de la sauvegarde,
le systŤme dťcryptera
automatiquement
toutes les donnťes qu'elle contient.
D'oý les 20 millions de $
qu'il en tire.
Vingt millions ?
Nom d'un chien, le crime paie !
C'est prŤs d'un fleuve,
d'un lac ou d'un ocťan ?
PrŤs d'un fleuve.
ll a louť un bateau.
ll fait son affaire
- et file en bateau.
- A moins...
A moins que je l'en empÍche.
Les plaques arrivent cet aprŤs-midi.
Parfait. Qu'elles arrivent ici.
lci ?
Qui s'ťtonnera
qu'on ferme ce bouge ?
On fait les billets ici
et on fout le feu.
Et Faye ?
On peut pas laisser de tťmoins.
Promenade nocturne ?
Comment vous avez su ?
La touche ''bis''.
C'est toujours les petits dťtails.
La puce.
20 millions
partagťs en deux, c'est...
apparemment hors de question.
Pourquoi suivre Jarod ?
Ca, c'est pour payer une dette.
Jarod, pour me faire des alliťs.
Pour me faire pardonner.
Le Centre a dťroulť le tapis rouge.
On verra.
On vous a envoyťe nettoyer ?
- Vous allez me tuer ?
- Ca dťpend de vous.
Alors pourquoi en parler ?
C'est pas si facile.
Vous ne voulez pas me tuer.
Vous Ítes moi.
C'est naturel,
pour des gens comme nous,
de dominer.
Vous et moi
n'avons rien en commun.
Nous savons tous les deux
que l'idťe d'ťgalitť humaine
ne fait que perpťtuer la mťdiocritť.
On n'est pas mťdiocres,
n'est-ce pas, Mlle Parker ?
Nous sommes indťpendants.
Et l'indťpendance
est le privilŤge des forts.
Dites-moi, Mlle Parker,
ŗ quel point Ítes-vous forte ?
Suffisamment.
- Comment Áa ?
- Essayez pour voir.
Ravi d'avoir travaillť avec vous.
M. Flanagan ? Je tiens
un restaurant du nom de Jax.
Vous avez mon numťro ?
Des amis ŗ vous sont en train
de comploter contre vous.
Ne m'oubliez pas
si j'ai besoin d'aide ŗ l'avenir.
Des flics sontpassťs.
Des flics ?
J'ai entendu que Flanagan
complotait contre toi.
Je voulais t'avertir.
C'est quoi, ce cirque ?
Tournez-vous lentement
et posez votre arme sur le billard.
Saletť de cellophane !
Et en plus, c'est cher.
Les Knight ressemblait ŗ Áa
quand Joey l'a tuť sur votre ordre.
Qui Ítes-vous ?
Tournez-vous et avancez.
Entrez lŗ-dedans.
T'es un homme mort, Jarod !
Tu m'entends ?
Refroidis tes ardeurs.
Vous avez l'air ŗ l'ťtroit.
lmaginez Dean Clark
dans sa cellule.
T'es un flic.
- Tu le savais ?
- A ton avis ?
Je ne suis ni flic, ni truand.
C'est assez compliquť.
Vous Ítes tous responsables
du meurtre de Les Knight.
J'ai pensť que ce serait bien
que vous subissiez
ce qu'il a subi.
Ecoute, Jarod.
C'ťtait pas mon idťe.
La ferme, Joey !
La ferme !
ll avait grillť Flanagan
et Flanagan l'a butť.
Et t'as larguť le corps
et piťgť Dean Clark.
Jarod, je te donne ce que tu veux.
Tu m'as donnť
tout ce que je voulais.
Jarod, tu peux pas
me laisser crever ici.
Peu importe si tu gŤles
ou si tu ťtouffes.
Comme tu dis, Joey...
Mort, c'est mort.
C'est vilain, Mlle Parker.
Pas de tÍte. Un seul bras.
Pas de jambe.
ll a dŻ se faire hacher
par le moteur d'un gros bateau.
Mais c'est lui.
Ca se voit ŗ ses pouces.
M. Lyle
a tirť sur vous.
ll a choisi pour vous.
A plus tard.
Ca va aller ?
Je suis fatiguťe.
Je vais me coucher.
Je sens que je vais dormir
comme un bťbť.
J'ai chargť la puce
avant que Raines la confisque.
Elle contenait des codes.
C'est une puce informatique.
Vous ne comprenez pas.
Elle contenait
des codes gťnťtiques.
Des codes gťnťtiques ?
De quoi ?
Ce serait plus juste
de dire ''de qui'' ?
- Alors ?
- Je ne suis pas gťnťticien.
Mais je me demande...
si Áa a un rapport avec Jarod.
Comment va mon ange ?
La puce contenait
des codes gťnťtiques.
T'inquiŤte.
Ce n'est pas important.
Assez pour me pousser
ŗ tuer un homme.
C'ťtait un ennemi.
Tu as fait le nťcessaire.
Pour qui ?
Respire le bon air.
On n'en a jamais assez.
Repose-toi.
Tu es p‚le comme la mort.
Je plaisante.
Quand vous aurez tťmoignť
et que tout sera fini,
envoyez-moi une carte de Hawaii.
Je n'ai pas assez d'argent
pour aller ŗ Jersey.
Maintenant, si.
D'oý Áa vient ?
Du compte personnel de Joey.
L'argent qu'il vous a pris.
Plus les intťrÍts.
Qui Ítes-vous vraiment ?
Un artiste.
Un procureur arrÍtť pour meurtre
Sťrieux revers pour la mafia
Un policier innocentť

Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Je n'ai rien fait !
- C'est quoi ?
- Avancez !
Je veux appeler mon père,
vous entendez ?
Chouette pyjama.
lls m'ont tiré du lit.
J'étais sous la douche.
Merci pour les détails.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Des ennuis.
De la pire espèce.
Tu devais quitter la ville.
Je suis venu te dire au revoir,
Sharpton.
Je savais que tu serais ici,
comme tous les soirs,
pour récupérer ton fric.
Même heure, même chaîîne.
J'ai entendu ça sur une redif.
De quoi tu parles ?
Chaque soir, tu pars seul,
tu fais ta tournée
pour ramasser le fric de la drogue.
Un soir,
tu as renversé une fillette.
Tu pouvais pas t'arrêter,
avec ta cargaison illégale,
alors tu l'as laissée mourir.
Et qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Je vais faire en sorte
que ce soit ta dernière tournée.
Tu as tout pigé.
Tu as raison.
Je livre de la drogue
et j'aime le fric.
Et c'est vrai que je pars seul.
Mais tu oublies un truc.
- Quoi ?
- A un moment,
je passe prendre mon associé.
Viens, on est en retard.
ll va crever de froid.
Le monde est dur, pas vrai ?
ll y a des Caméléons parmi nous.
On m'a enlevé à ma famille.
Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà
plus doué que les autres.
Combien de gens sont morts
à cause de moi ?
Depuis mon évasion,
je cherche mon passé.
C'est un Caméléon.
Un génie qui peut devenir
qui il veut.
- Le Centre le veut vivant.
- De préférence.
ll défend les opprimés.
La vie est un don.
Vous êtes médecin ?
Aujourd'hui, oui.
Bougez pas ou le chien
vous arrache la pomme d'Adam.
Pas vrai ?
ll a l'air gentil,
mais c'est un enragé.
ll vous a sauvé la vie, notez.
ll vous a trouvé sur un parking.
ll a aboyé
jusqu'à ce que je vous trouve.
Quoi ?
T'es pas d'accord ?
Va te coucher.
N'essayez pas de vous lever.
Bougez pas.
Reposez-vous.
Vous avez pris un sacré coup.
Vous avez besoin de repos.
Reposez-vous.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Vous avez été agressé.
lls vous ont pris tout votre fric.
Désolé. Votre fric a disparu.
Ca craint.
Mais votre machin est là.
Je l'ai récupéré. C'est bien.
Où suis-je ?
Où vous êtes ?
Mon ami, vous êtes
dans mon petit coin
de paradis,
du moins pour l'instant.
Je m'appelle Argyle.
Je m'appelle comme ça
à cause de ma tache sur la cuisse.
Vous voulez la voir ?
Non ? Pas de problème.
Je vous en veux pas.
Vous avez plein de trucs.
J'espère que mon pansement
tiendra le coup.
Le chien s'est jamais plaint
de mes soins médicaux.
Mais vous êtes meilleur juge,
vu que vous êtes un vrai
médecin et tout.
- Un médecin ?
- Parfaitement.
Un médecin, mon ami.
D'après ce papier,
vous vous appelez Jarod
et vous êtes...
chirurgien thoracique.
- Une seringue de 3cc.
- Elle s'effondre.
Elle est en arrêt respiratoire.
ll faut la ventiler.
Enlevez la pompe.
L'air entre dans les deuxpoumons.
Elle reprend des couleurs.
J'aime ce bruit.
J'aime ce bruit.
On va avoir du chauffage.
Rien ne marche jamais, ici.
Même pas toi.
Jamais !
Tout ça va changer.
Ca va changer bientôt.
Je pense faire 4 ans de fac.
Je pense faire médecine.
Je pense aux ordonnances.
Je suis dans la galère
depuis des années
et je me dis
que vous êtes mon jackpot.
Votre jackpot ?
La poule aux oeufs d'or,
la chance de ma vie.
L'hôpital me payera une belle prime
pour avoir retrouvé son cher médecin.
Je ne suis pas médecin.
Vous êtes pas médecin ?
Alors vous êtes qui ?
J'en sais rien.
- C'est quoi ?
- Une Table T.
Une quoi ?
''T'' comme ''torture''.
Le Tribunal des Sentinelles.
lls veulent des réponses.
lls nous lâcheront pas avant.
Vous plaisantez ?
Ne vous salissez pas, Broots.
lls veulent nous déstabiliser.
C'est pour ça
qu'ils sont venus la nuit.
lls essaient de nous briser.
Sur le plan émotionnel.
Ca marche. Je suis ébranlé.
Comment vous savez tout ça ?
J'ai été de l'autre côté de la vitre.
Et comment ça se passe ?
Bien. Si on est
de l'autre côté de la vitre.
Génial !
Je savais que Raines
serait dans le coup.
Reste à savoir
qui est derrière tout ça.
Le Triumvirat.
Kreskin.
- Mais qui dirige l'affaire ?
- Brigitte.
Cette garce est pire que la peste.
- Qui sont les types dans l'ombre ?
- Aucune idée.
ll faut prévenir mon père.
Je ne sais pas s'il pourra
nous aider.
Coucou !
La dernière fois qu'on s'est vues,
vous vouliez tuer mon père.
Comment êtes-vous revenue
au Centre ?
Avant d'aborder la question,
j'ai promis à des amis
de comprendre pourquoi,
après 1 8 mois,
Jarod court toujours.
lmpossible.
C'est eux qui l'ont créé.
lls savent ce dont il est capable.
En effet.
lls pensent qu'il n'a pu échapper
au Centre qu'avec l'aide
de l'un d'entre vous
ou de vous tous.
lls pensent ça ?
Ou vous leur avez fait penser ça ?
En tout cas, nous saurons qui c'est.
On va commencer par vous.
Une chose est sûre :
vous aimez les bonbons.
Le sucre, c'est mauvais.
Ca va carier toutes vos dents,
les faire tomber.
J'ai de la chance,
j'ai de bonnes dents.
C'est toutes les miennes.
Qu'est-ce qui vous arrive ?
Vous savez pas qui vous êtes
et vous êtes brûlant.
C'est ce qui arrive
quand on reste dehors.
Le problème,
c'est que vous regardiez pas
derrière vous.
Faut toujours regarder
derrière soi, mec.
Y a toujours quelqu'un
caché dans l'ombre. Un clodo,
un voyou prêt à vous tirer dessus.
ll faut regarder derrière vous.
Vous fuyez peut-être
cette mignonnette.
Qui c'est ?
Qui est cette jolie dame ?
Elle vous gonflait pour le fric ?
''Tu ramènes pas de fric !''
Valait mieux être médecin.
ll faudra bien réfléchir,
la prochaine fois.
Ca alors...
Ca alors...
Vous êtes pas médecin.
Vous êtes ranger.
Non, pompier.
Non, agent de désinsectisation.
Non, agent du FBl.
Excusez-moi, monsieur.
Je suis un peu perdu.
Vous êtes qui ?
Monsieur ?
Je ne sais pas qui je suis.
Je n'ai rien fait.
Broots a peur.
Vous pensez
qu'il tiendra le coup ?
Avant ou après
avoir fait dans son froc ?
Je peux avoir un peignoir ?
Jarod est-il plus malin que vous ?
Vous le poursuivez
depuis plus d'un an.
Vous échappe-t-il
parce qu'il est plus malin ?
Nous nous efforçons chaque jour
de trouver Jarod,
mais la roue de la fortune
n'est pas encore
tombée sur nous.
Elle tourne.
C'est un Caméléon.
ll estpartout.
Qu'est-ce que vous avez ?
Jarod a interconnecté
173 appels internationaux,
mais on ne peutpas localiser
ces appels car au lieu
d'un transfert déclenché
par un seul appel,
chacun des 173 appels
a été lancé individuellement.
C'estgénial !
- Et très cher.
- Je me fiche de ce que ça coûte.
Tant mieux, parce que Jarod
a donné le numéro de votre carte.
ll est intelligent et malin,
ce qui rend sa poursuite amusante.
- Non...
- Voulez-vous dire
qu'il est votre héros ?
- Non, je ne dis pas ça.
- Alors quoi ?
Je dis simplement que...
Jarod est intelligent,
et que ça se lit
dans ses yeux.
- Ca se voit.
- D'après votre dossier,
vous n'avez jamais vu Jarod.
- Vous ne l'avez jamais vu ?
- Non.
Je faisais allusion à des photos.
Bonjour, M. Broots.
Mon Dieu !
Aidez-moi.
- Je vous en prie.
- 1 8 mois.
Aucun résultat.
Nous avons du mal à croire
à tant d'inefficacité.
Aidez-moi.
Si vous n'aidez pas Jarod,
alors qui l'aide ?
Je pourrais avoir un peignoir,
s'il vous plaîît ?
On est pareils, vous et moi.
Des tas de noms.
On voyage léger...
Toujours en cavale.
Vous fuyez qui, d'abord ?
La loi ?
La loi au visage souriant
et au coeur de pierre ?
Vous fuyez qui ?
Votre tête est peut-être mise à prix.
Votre tête est brûlante.
Vous êtes brûlant, mec.
Ca craint. Vous êtes resté
trop longtemps dehors.
Trop longtemps dehors.
Je le savais.
Je le savais. Ca craint.
Et si le chauffage
y mettait un peu du sien ?
Je t'aime, Jarod.
Ne me quitte pas.
Je t'en prie, ne me quitte pas.
Ca va, mec ?
Me claquez pas dans les doigts !
Ne mourez pas !
Restez avec moi !
Vous êtes mon jackpot.
Ne mourez pas.
Me claquez pas dans les doigts !
ll y a une étincelle.
Je connais la procédure,
mais le feu... la chaleur...
J'essaie de ne pas respirer,
mais c'est trop tard.
Le hublot est coincé.
Le hublot est coincé !
Personne ne peut nous sauver !
Je brûle ! Je brûle !
Votre fièvre est tombée.
Le diable vous a laissé revenir.
C'est quoi, le Centre ?
Sur vos petites vidéos zarbi,
il y a écrit :
''Propriété du Centre''.
C'est quoi ?
J'en sais rien.
Vous en savez rien ?
Je vais vous dire ce que je pense.
Je crois que vous êtes
une grosse tête.
Et que les gens du Centre
vous recherchent.
Ce qui signifie
que vous avez de la valeur pour eux,
et donc pour moi.
Moi aussi, je suis une grosse tête.
Je suis une grosse tête.
Pourquoi tu veux pas marcher ?
J'essaie d'arranger les choses.
J'essaie de résoudre tout ça.
Rien de méchant.
Rien de méchant.
J'essaie d'arranger les choses.
Qui êtes-vous ?
La femme la plus fière du monde.
- Qui suis-je ?
- Fais confiance
à tes sentiments. Fais toujours
confiance à tes sentiments.
Jarod, je ne peuxpas accepter ça.
Je l'ai faitpour vous.
Cette carte s'adresse à un autre.
Vous ne m'aimez pas ?
Nous avons du travail.
Sydney est votre père, ou quoi ?
Une chance que Debbie soit
chez sa marraine.
lls ne lâchent plus Sydney.
Vous portez une montre au lit ?
- Oui.
- Pourquoi ?
Au cas où je me réveille,
pour prendre des notes.
Reprenons.
Quand vont-ils le lâcher ?
Quand il aura parlé.
ll est là depuis 6 heures.
lls le garderont encore 6 h,
s'ils veulent.
Pourquoi font-ils ça ?
Parce qu'ils le peuvent.
Jarod est l'oeuvre de ma vie.
Mon intérêt pour lui
est avant tout scientifique.
Cet intérêt
exige que je reste objectif,
ce qui exclut toute culpabilité.
Vous ne m'aimez pas, Sydney ?
Bonne fête, papa
Pardonnez-moi, mon père
carj'ai péché.
J'ai trahi un ami.
- Avez-vous prié Dieu ?
- Même Lui
ne peutpardonner ce quej'ai fait.
Le lien entre Jarod et moi
est aussi unique que Jarod.
Assez unique pour vous battre
pour sa liberté ?
Je ne ferais jamais ça.
Jarod est un cas très complexe.
J'ai essayé de le maintenir en vie
et de sauver son équilibre mental
pendant cette poursuite.
Vous êtes sa nounou ?
Nous devons être patients.
Votre tactique
est bien trop agressive.
Si vous le poussez à bout,
Jarod disparaîîtra à jamais.
J'ai essayé de le ramener.
C'est mon objectif.
En tant que scientifique,
je crois que le Centre
est pour lui l'endroit idéal
où développer
son potentiel extraordinaire.
Vous ne savez pas qui est Jarod.
Vous ne savez pas qui est Jarod.
Vous êtes pas médecin,
vous êtes ranger.
Non, pompier.
Non, agent de désinsectisation.
Non, agent du FBl.
Excusez-moi, monsieur.
Vous êtes qui ?
Vous êtes qui ?
Je peux être quije veux.
Je peux être médecin,
ingénieur, astronaute.
Maisje ne sais pas quije suis !
C'est notre père qui t'a donné ça.
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Ton frère.
Jarod, trouve nos parents !
Je veux savoir de quoij'ai l'air.
Je veux savoir quije suis.
Je suis pas chirurgien esthétique.
Je suis pas médecin.
Je suis pas garde-côtes.
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Pas Florence Nightingale.
Voilà à quoi tu ressembles.
Voilà qui tu es.
Tu es mon fils, tu es ma vie.
Je t'aime, Jarod.
Tu as renversé une fillette.
Je m'appelle Argyle.
A-R-G-
Y-L-E.
Vous êtes le Centre ?
- Peut-être. Pourquoi ?
- Je sais pas.
J'ai peut-être un truc pour vous.
Je suis tout ouïe.
Ce chien est un héros.
Je l'ai sauvé de la fourrière.
Et il vous a sauvé.
ll vous a sauvé.
Je l'ai sauvé. C'est ironique.
Depuis quand je suis prisonnier ?
Prisonnier ?
Prisonnier ?
C'est dur, mec !
Comment diriez-vous ?
Comment je dirais ?
Je dirais que c'est ironique.
Je dirais que c'est ironique.
Mettez-vous à ma place
une seconde.
Une hôtesse de l'air
se tape un délire
et tue tous les passagers.
300 personnes disparaissent
dans les nuages.
Le facteur devient timbré : pan !
Un chauffeur
de train déraille : boum !
Et nous, on est là,
à se dire :
''ll est dingue !
C'est complètement dingue !
''Ouf ! C'est pas tombé sur moi.''
Le problème,
c'est que vous avez pas l'air net.
Je veux juste m'assurer
que ça tombe pas sur moi.
C'est honnête.
Et au fait, j'ai pas l'intention
de vous faire du mal.
Alors soyez tranquille.
Si j'avais un jeu de cartes,
je vous montrerais un tour.
C'est mon téléphone ?
Qui avez-vous appelé ?
Le médecin.
Pour savoir s'il venait
- à domicile.
- Vous avez appelé Sydney ?
ll était pas là.
C'est une dame qui a répondu.
Mlle Parker ?
Non, Brigitte.
- Elle a une voix sexy.
- Vous lui avez dit où on est ?
J'ai l'air d'une pancarte ?
Ecoutez-moi.
Ces gens, cette organisation,
ils vous tueront.
Faites-moi confiance.
Vous faire confiance ?
La confiance !
Super mot.
ll est sur chaque pièce,
sur chaque billet
et sur chaque bombe,
et pourtant, ça s'achète pas !
lls vont vous piéger.
D'après Brigitte,
vous avez réponse à tout.
Ne gâchez pas tout.
Tout va bien !
Y a 3 h, vous saviez pas
si vous étiez
ranger ou cow-boy.
Et vous me serinez
avec une dangereuse firme secrète.
C'est vous qu'ils veulent.
Vous. Moi, je ne fais
que la livraison.
Ecoutez-moi !
Je parle d'expérience.
Vous avez affaire au diable.
Merci de vous joindre à nous.
C'était une invitation
que je ne pouvais pas
laisser passer.
Ecrasez votre clope.
Je ne vais pas cracher de fumée.
Eteignez-la.
C'est cruel,
même pour une Table T.
Allez-y, ma belle.
Je ne bouge pas.
Le Triumvirat s'interroge sur
votre motivation à capturer Jarod.
lls devraient peut-être
sortir la tête
du sable.
Je fais mon travail, point.
Ce que nous voulons, c'est la vérité.
La vérité.
C'est un mot très intéressant,
venant de vous.
Vous n'avez pas
d'autres préoccupations
dans votre travail ?
Pas de problèmes à résoudre
ni de conflits avec le Centre
ou avec Jarod ?
Je n'ai aucun problème
à résoudre avec le Centre.
Est-ce la vérité ?
Je connais la vérité, Parker.
Et de quelle vérité
s'agit-il, Jarod ?
De la vérité
sur ce qui te rend triste.
Je veux savoir
ce qui est arrivé à maman.
Je n'ai aucun problème
à résoudre avec le Centre.
Vous n'avez pas répondu pour Jarod.
Où as-tu trouvé
la bague de ma mère ?
- Dans un de ses coffres.
- Comme son dossier médical.
C'est fou ce qu'on y trouve.
- Jarod ?
- Tu connais la musique.
Tu m'aides à percer un secret
etje t'aide à en percer un.
On n'a rien trouvé
sur lgor ni sur Fenigor.
J'ignore s'il aidait ma mère
ou s'il l'a trahie.
Continue à chercher.
lgor détient la clé de notre passé.
- Comment le sais-tu ?
- Mes entrailles me le disent.
Vous voulez dire
qu'en 1 8 mois de poursuite,
il ne vous a pas influencée ?
C'est ce que je dis.
D'aucune manière ?
Aucune influence.
Pas même sur le plan affectif ?
ll vaut mieuxperdre un amour
que nejamais avoir aimé.
Tu es d'accord ?
C'est très triste.
Pourquoi on finit comme ça ?
Comment ?
Seuls.
En quête.
C'est ironique.
On veut la même chose.
Quelqu'un à chérir,
qui nous chérisse.
Tu crois qu'on trouvera
un tel amour ?
Pourquoi on finit comme ça ?
On a terminé.
Vous pouvez fumer une cigarette.
Je viens d'arrêter.
Brigitte, si votre corps
est à la hauteur
de votre cervelle,
on pourrait s'entendre.
Venant d'un génie comme vous,
c'est flatteur.
Au fait, vous aviez vu juste,
pour notre coco.
ll est vraiment dingue.
Oui, il est fou.
Mais il est utile.
Avez-vous fixé un prix ?
S'il s'agit de Jarod...
Je suis au téléphone.
J'étais en train
de dépouiller un bourge,
l'autre jour,
quand j'ai vu un dandy
en Rolls Royce.
Une Rolls Royce ?
Super brillante.
Bref, le type sort de voiture
et j'ai commencé à regarder
ses sapes. J'ai maté ses sapes.
Et je me suis dit :
''Je connais pas ce type.
''Je sais pas s'il ment,
s'il bat son chien ou sa femme.
''Et pourtant, j'ai immédiatement
''un respect incroyable pour lui.
A cause de son costume.''
- Continuez.
- Son costume...
sa chemise, sa montre,
ses pompes, tout le tremblement.
Des trucs plus chers
les uns que les autres.
De la soie à gogo,
du cuir encore et encore.
Et vous savez quoi ?
Je me suis dit
que pour fringuer ce type,
Ca avait dû coûter au moins...
au moins...
1 0 000 dollars, Brigitte.
Est-ce le prix du respect,
M. Argyle ?
On est que dalle sans respect.
1 0 000 dollars,
c'est une grosse somme.
Mais je crois que je pourrai
convaincre mon équipe.
Grosse tête.
Ne faites pas ça.
Notez ça.
C'est à 3 h d'ici.
Je prends le prochain vol.
Si vous avez trouvé Jarod,
moi seule peux le ramener.
Désolée.
Cette fois, on le tient.
Tout est pour le mieux.
Vous retournez chez vous.
Moi, je me tire.
Tout ira bien.
Faites-moi confiance.
Faites-moi confiance.
Ca craint !
Pourquoi ils nous font
attendre ici ?
Quand wonder woman
le ramènera,
ça prouvera qu'on ne voulait pas
vraiment le capturer.
Ce sera notre arrêt de mort.
Je ne pensais pas soutenir Jarod.
Je ne voulais pas dire ça.
Mon ange...
Je suis venu dès que j'ai su.
Comment osent-ils mettre ma fille
sur la Table T ? Ca va ?
Pour l'instant.
Vous sortirez tous d'ici.
Je vais passer quelques savons.
Papa ? Fais attention.
Je ne pensais pas être content
de voir votre paternel.
Moi aussi,
je suis contente qu'il soit là.
Malheureusement,
on peut croire
qu'il était là dès le début.
Je regrette, Mlle Parker.
ll a recommencé.
- Brigitte ?
- Enchantée.
Y a un truc pour moi ?
Je vous apporte un sac de respect.
1 0 000 dollars en vrai.
Où est Jarod ?
Au sous-sol, à la chaufferie.
Quand j'aurai Jarod.
Mettez-lui une balle dans la tête.
- Avec joie.
- Une balle dans la tête ?
C'est pas gentil !
Tiens, si c'est pas
la Belle au bois dormant.
Et on vous disait
difficile à attraper.
ll est l'heure de se lever.
Réveillez-vous, mon chou.
Allez, réveillez-vous.
On rentre au bercail.
Désolé. Pas question
de retourner là-bas.
T'es pas si méchant.
Content de vous revoir, willie.
Votre jackpot.
Je savais qu'il fallait
vous faire confiance.
Tout bien réfléchi,
je vais en faire don
à la fourrière.
Au nom du chien.
Comme vous dites,
c'est un héros.
Et rendez-moi mes Pez.
Non, désolé.
Ce n'est que Jarod.
Mais vous pouvez
récupérer votre blonde.
Faites de beaux rêves, mon chou.
Elle s'est plantée, pas vrai ?
- Jarod ?
- Vivant, libre. Vous aussi.
Merci pour le peignoir.
Je te raccompagne ?
Où ? Dans une autre impasse ?
- De quoi parles-tu ?
- Arrête !
Tu m'as fait subir la Table T ?
Je me demandais
quand tu comprendrais.
Je ne t'aurais pas trompée.
Tu es une Parker. Ce serait idiot.
Et puis, ces chaussures
me font un mal de chien.
Si c'est vrai,
pourquoi t'allier avec Brigitte ?
Elle a négocié avec le Triumvirat.
Sa peau contre la tienne.
Je l'ai suivie
pour m'en débarrasser.
Action, réaction, compromis.
ll ne s'agit pas de qui sait quoi,
mais de qui croit savoir quoi.
Pour écarter les chiens affamés,
on leur lance un os
de temps en temps.
C'est ce que je suis, un os ?
Tu es mon héritière.
Tu l'as encore prouvé aujourd'hui.
N'oublie jamais ça.
Ca te maintiendra en vie.
Fais-moi confiance.
Moi, je te fais confiance.
Tu dois me faire confiance.
Fais-moi confiance.
Commentpeux-tu
lui faire confiance ?
Ca va aller, Mlle Parker ?
Bien sûr.
Partons d'ici. Allons-nous-en.
Vous pensez que
quelqu'un du Centre aide Jarod ?
Au Centre, tout est possible.
Nous le cherchons toujours,
mais nous trouverons la fuite.
Avez-vous vu cette femme ?
Tu as découvert
quelque chose qui nous aiderait
à trouver Jarod ?
Continue de travailler.
A demain. Même heure,
même chaîîne.
Tu te souviens de moi ?
- Tu n'apprends pas vite.
- Peut-être pas.
Mais je ne répète jamais une erreur.
Qui t'es ?
Je suis des tas de gens.
Mais ce soir...
je suis chauffeur routier.

Conclusion ?
Le lien familial est instinctif.
Sacré.
Bravo, Jarod.
Ma famille a disparu.
Sije reste ici, qui voudra de moi ?
Oů on est ?

Méthode de combat,

Vous m'avez touché.
- A la tęte.
- Ca vous va ŕ ravir.
Quelque chose ŕ nous dire ?
Ca va ?
La voie est libre.
C'est le QG de la testostérone
ou quoi ?
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
ll semble que Jarod
s'appręte ŕ partir en guerre.
Ton mari a intéręt
ŕ apporter la rançon.
Silence !
Tu vois quelque chose ?
Rien.
- Pas de flics ?
- Que des putes et des camés.
Ca va aller.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Ne vous inquiétez pas.
On m'a enlevé ŕ ma famille.
Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjŕ
plus doué que les autres.
Combien de gens sont morts
ŕ cause de moi ?
Depuis mon évasion,
je cherche mon passé.
C'est un Caméléon.
Un génie qui peut devenir
qui il veut.
- Le Centre le veut vivant.
- De préférence.
ll défend les opprimés.
La vie est un don.
Vous ętes médecin ?
Aujourd'hui, oui.
Bravo pour hier soir.
Ni coups de feu ni victimes.
On aime ce genre de victoire.
C'est un plaisir
d'appartenir ŕ la brigade T1 4.
Mais j'ignore ce que signifie le T.
Taule ŕ perpétuité,
pour ceux qui trinquent.
Turbo, pour le chef.
Brigade Turbo.
Une machine bien huilée.
Vous devriez bien vous intégrer.
J'ai su pour l'accident.
Pauvre lieutenant Lange.
On regrettera Dan.
Si je retrouve son assassin,
je le plains !
Cette aire de pique-nique
était sympa
avant ces histoires.
Encore sur une piste ?
Lange n'était pas un héros,
mais un idiot.
- Dégagez.
- La vérité fait mal, hein ?
Non. Ca, oui.
Doucement !
- Pourquoi le défendre ?
- ll s'est sacrifié
- pour son coéquipier !
- Dan était dingue.
Ca l'a tué.
Devant les gosses de Lange.
Bravo !
Je ne savais pas.
Un officier de police

Je t'aime aussi.
Les données de la semaine.
Ca va ?
Je peux vous faire confiance ?
Absolument. Je vous ai raconté
mon ręve sur Mlle Parker, non ?
Aidez-moi ŕ trouver une personne.
Elle s'appelle Michelle Loca.
C'est tout ce dont je me souviens
ŕ son sujet.
C'est important pour moi.
Soyez discret.
Vous pouvez compter sur moi.
Désolée, mais on a besoin de Broots.
Le devoir m'appelle.
Tout va bien ?
Oui, Mlle Parker.
Vous ętes pressé, Broots ?
Le papier remis par Sydney.
- Vous écoutiez ŕ la porte ?
- Accidentellement.
Appelez la police. Le papier !
Le Dr Pavlov salive depuis
qu'il a trouvé ce mot de Jarod.
Obéissez ŕ Sydney.
S'il protčge Jarod,
je dois le savoir.
Compris ?
ll faudra me raconter votre ręve !
Ca y est.
Vous visiez quoi, Mooney ?
Cleveland ?
Ca va ?
J'ai besoin d'air.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
Je ne sais pas.
Bon choix de simulation, Jarod.
Les simulations, c'est mon rayon.
Cooke et vous avez été excellents.
On est lŕ en renfort.
Quoi de neuf ?
- J'ai vraiment mal tiré.
- C'était trop familier.
Ca vous a rappelé votre blessure...
et la mort de Dan Lange.
- C'est trčs récent.
- J'ai cru revivre ce moment.
J'entendais les coups partir,
Dan qui hurlait,
ma douleur ŕ la jambe.
C'est le choc post-traumatique.
Vous avez vu quelqu'un ?
J'ai des séances
avec le psy du service.
Je n'arrive pas ŕ oublier.
Plusieurs facteurs
peuvent déclencher le choc :
la colčre,
la peur, la culpabilité.
Lange est mort pour vous sauver.
Vos blessures physiques guérissent.
Soignez vos blessures affectives.
Pour ça,
je dois retrouver le meurtrier.
Ces simus aiguisent nos capacités.
Ca peut apaiser vos émotions.
Une banque avait été braquée.
Le suspect a abandonné sa voiture
et est entré dans la patinoire.
Lange et moi, on l'a suivi
dans les vestiaires.
On a avancé vers les gradins,
les coups sont partis
d'en haut.
J'ai été touché ŕ la jambe
et je suis tombé.
Dan s'est mis entre le tireur et moi.
On se serait cru en pleine guerre.
Stevens et Cooke étaient lŕ-bas.
- Vous les voyiez ?
- Pas la peine.
C'est la procédure habituelle.
A ce moment-lŕ, Lange a été touché
et s'est écroulé.
C'est lŕ que j'ai vu le tireur.
ll était en pleine lumičre.
Un homme de 1 ,80 m, athlétique,
avec un bouc et une casquette.
Le salaud savait ce qu'il faisait.
lls ont trouvé des douilles de M1 32.
Pour perforer le gilet.
Pour tuer des flics.
Ca a déchiqueté le gilet de Lange.
On nous appelle la brigade Turbo.
Les pistons d'un męme moteur.
Mais si on tire pas au bon moment,
le moteur cale.
Des gens meurent.
- Du nouveau ?
- Pas sur Michelle Loca.
Mais sur Michelle Stomatis, oui.
Mariée, vivant prčs de New York.
Mais il y a mieux.
- Dites toujours !
- Aucune trace
de Michelle Loca
avant son arrivée ŕ Albany en 1 974.
Ni permis de conduire
ni acte de naissance.
Cherchez plus avant.
Ne donnez que son adresse ŕ Sydney.
ll faut retrouver
le mot laissé par Jarod.
ll a dű bien le cacher.
Vous ne l'avez pas vu,
n'est-ce pas, Broots ?
Sűrement pas.
De toute évidence, cette femme
compte beaucoup pour Sydney.
Et aprčs ?
Et le respect de l'intimité ?
Je sais combien Sydney vous est cher.
Męme moi, j'aime bien ce vieux bouc.
Mais c'est peut-ętre lié ŕ Jarod.
Et c'est ce qui compte.
Standard ŕ brigade T14.
Des suspects
sont entrés dans la patinoire.
lls sont armés et dangereux.
lci Lange.
Je suis sur place avec Mooney.
Stevens et Cooke nous couvrent.
Terminé.
Bien reçu.
On garde le contact. Terminé.
Demande de renforts, d'urgence !
Répétez !
Lange a été touché !
Un officier ŕ terre !
Bien reçu.
Renforts en route. Terminé.
Répondez, T14.
Lange, répondez.
lci le standard, répondez.
lci Lange. Je suis touché.
Je ne sens plus mesjambes.
Daniel, parle-moi.
L'ambulance arrive.
J'ai tellement froid, Liz.
Reste avec moi, Daniel.
Dis ŕ mes fils...
Dis ŕ Jordan et Cody
que papa les aime.
Tu le leur diras toi-męme.
Tiens bon.
Daniel ? Mon Dieu !
Reste avec moi, Daniel.
Dis ŕ mes fils...
Dis ŕ Jordan et Cody
que papa les aime.
Des figurines de céramique
avec une chevelure végétale.
Ca tient compagnie.
Je n'ai pas la main verte
et les animaux me détestent.
C'est une solution logique.
Jarod.
Le remplaçant de Dan Lange.
On ne remplace pas
un homme comme lui.
Vous étiez au standard
lors de sa mort.
J'ai été la derničre ŕ lui parler.
Ca a dű ętre dur pour vous,
vu ce qu'il y avait
entre Dan et vous.
Vous étiez amoureux.
J'ai écouté la bande.
Je l'ai senti ŕ votre voix,
la façon dont vous vous parliez.
Ca a dű ętre un réconfort pour Dan,
de vous avoir jusqu'au bout.
Daniel a perdu sa femme
il y a un an.
Depuis, il était seul
avec les garçons.
Vous étiez proche de ses fils ?
Oui, trčs.
La seule famille qui leur reste,
c'est les parents de Dan.
On a essayé de les contacter
pour la garde de Jordan et Cody.
Mais ils sont en voyage en Europe.
Ces gosses vont me manquer.
C'est dur
de perdre ceux qu'on aime.
Je n'ai pas encore vidé
son vestiaire.
C'est ridicule.
Mais ça rend les choses
si définitives.
Si concrčtes.
Je ne veux pas l'oublier.
Je veux faire quelque chose d'utile.
Au moins retirer du marché
ces balles tueuses de flics.
Dan avait parlé de quelqu'un
qui aurait pu fournir ces munitions ?
ll a parlé d'un certain Petrovka.
Un Russe lié ŕ la mafia moscovite.
Selon lnterpol,
il fait entrer ces munitions
aux Etats-Unis.
Entre autres.
C'est lui.
J'ai entendu son nom avant que
Daniel décide de démissionner.
ll voulait arręter ?
Oui, c'est bizarre.
Peu de temps avant sa mort,
il est devenu distant,
comme s'il se doutait
de quelque chose.
C'est bizarre.
ll disait qu'il était crevé.
Mais je crois
que c'était ŕ cause des enfants.
Jordan et Cody étaient tout pour lui.
lls risquent de se retrouver seuls.
Michelle Loca.
Plus je cherche, moins je trouve.
Męme ŕ la ClA, au FBl...
ll n'est pas lŕ.
...ŕ lnterpol.
Aucune trace de son existence
avant 1 974.
Alors, je me suis dit :
qui peut effacer le passé
de quelqu'un comme ça ?
- Elle travaillait pour le Centre.
- Gagné !
Cette psychologue travaillait
avec Sydney sur le projet Caméléon.
Elle est belle, hein ?
Trouvez le lien avec le mot de Jarod.
Je m'y mets tout de suite.
Vous cachez quelque chose.
Vous avez entendu.
J'ai donné ma parole ŕ Sydney.
Vous vous en voulez de lui mentir ?
En me disant le reste,
vous ne serez pas plus méprisable
que maintenant.
Exact ?
Allons dans mon bureau.
Jordan et Cody sont renfermés.
C'est normal.
Les grands-parents auront la garde ?
lls sont ŕ l'étranger.
On essaie de les contacter.
S'ils ne peuvent pas les garder,
que se passera-t-il ?
Les enfants de cet âge
ayant souffert de traumatismes
sont trčs difficiles ŕ placer.
Sije reste ici, qui voudra de moi ?
Quelle tenue !
Tu dois bien jouer.
On fait une partie ?
Si vous voulez.
Vous ętes flic.
En effet.
Vous connaissiez notre pčre ?
Non, mais on dit
qu'il était formidable.
Vous vous rappelez
quelque chose d'étrange
avant son accident ?
Un soir, il a crié.
- Crié ?
- Aprčs les hommes.
Le bruit de la dispute
nous a réveillés.
- Vous avez vu ces hommes ?
- Non, on les a entendus.
Papa était furieux.
ll disait qu'il ne voulait pas
ętre impliqué.
C'était quelques nuits avant...
Vous savez.
Ca va ?
Avant de partir travailler,
il disait
que rien ne lui arriverait.
ll promettait.
Ton pčre est mort
en sauvant un autre policier.
ll n'y a rien de plus héroďque.
C'est mal.
Sydney a droit ŕ une vie privée.
Continuez ŕ chercher.
ll furetait par lŕ ŕ mon arrivée.
Je l'ai.
Mon Dieu !
Je vous cherchais,
il me faut votre rapport.
Je le laisserai sur votre bureau.
- Du nouveau, Broots ?
- Presque.
Donnez-moi ça !
C'est un acte de naissance.
La mčre est Michelle Loca,
mais le pčre n'est pas nommé.
J'étais derričre les gradins
avec Cooke. Des coups sontpartis.
On a riposté aussitôt.
J'ai été touché
presque tout de suite.
Lange a commencé ŕ faire feu.
ll est tombé
etj'ai vu le tireur.
ll avait un bouc et une casquette.
L'échange a duré prčs de 20 mn.
Quand on a arręté,
on a entendu une autre arme.
Un 9 mm MP5
qui faisait feu depuis les gradins.
L'échange a duré prčs de 20 mn.
lls rouvrent déjŕ la patinoire !
ll y a encore des dégâts.
Quelles armes avaient
Mooney et Lange ce jour-lŕ ?
Des 9 mm.
Et Stevens et Cooke ?
Des M1 6.
Comme d'habitude.
On nous tire dessus !
Mesjambes !
Daniel, tiens bon.
Je suis désolé.
Je n'aurais pas dű vous amener ici.
Pourquoi ces questions
sur les armes ?
Mooney et Lange n'étaient
peut-ętre pas couverts.
Quoi ? Stevens et Cooke
étaient juste derričre.
Vraiment ?
Cooke a parlé d'échange
de coups de feu.
Oui, et alors ?
S'il y en a eu tant que ça,
pourquoi
il n'y a pas plus d'impacts ?
Et pourquoi les impacts
ont-ils la męme taille ?
Je suis perdue.
Une balle de M1 6 laisse un impact
plus petit qu'un 9 mm.
ll faut faire attention
pour le remarquer.
ll n'y a aucun impact de fusil.
Stevens et Cooke sont bons tireurs.
Je les ai vus ŕ l'oeuvre.
lls ont raté leur cible
ŕ 30 mčtres.
Pourquoi ?
lls n'auraient pas visé le tireur ?
ll n'y avait peut-ętre pas de tireur.
Qui a tué Daniel ?
Peut-ętre...
Stevens et Cooke.
L'acte de naissance date de 1 974.
Un garçon nommé Nicholas
est né 8 mois aprčs le départ
de Michelle du Centre.
Je le croyais asexué
et voilŕ qu'il a un fils !
Ne nous en męlons pas.
Rangez votre morale au vestiaire !
Je refuserais qu'on se męle
de la vie de ma fille.
Faisons marche arričre !
Sydney a de la testostérone
et vous aussi.
Ca doit venir de l'eau.
Voulez-vous ranger ça !
Le Centre a fait disparaîître
Michelle. Sydney a assez souffert.
ll ne s'agit pas de Sydney,
mais de Jarod.
Je me demande si vous pensez
ce que vous dites.
Une voix d'outre-tombe.
lci le lieutenant Daniel Lange.
4 mars,
23 h 18.
Je me trouve 570 Franklin Avenue.
J'observe actuellement
Stevens, Cooke et Mooney
avec un certain Petrovka,
lié ŕ la mafia russe
et accusé de trafic
d'armes et de drogue.
C'est la 2e fois quej'assiste
ŕ un échange d'argent.
Je compte remettre ces bandes
au procureur
dčs quej'aurai assez de preuves.
Je voudrais tout arręter
avant qu'il y ait des victimes.
Vous ętes arrivé trop tard.
Mais ça ne sera pas mon cas.
A mon retour au Centre,
ton bureau était vide,
tes projets redistribués
et ton appartement vide.
Tu n'as laissé aucune trace.
Je n'avais que ça.
Si tu m'aimais,
comment tu as pu partir
sans me dire au revoir ?
Parce que je t'aimais.
J'ai reçu la copie
d'un acte de naissance.
Un garçon du nom de Nicholas,
né huit mois aprčs ton départ.
Pčre inconnu.
Est-ce que je suis le pčre ?
Réponds !
Tu te rappelles le week-end
de Pâques qu'on a passé au chalet ?
Peu aprčs, un matin,
j'ai eu un malaise.
J'ai pris rendez-vous
chez le médecin.
Tu étais enceinte.
J'étais tellement heureuse !
Pour moi, pour nous.
Je me suis précipitée au Centre
pour te prévenir,
mais on m'a arrętée.
Qui ?
Un homme que je n'avais
jamais vu avant.
J'ignore comment,
mais il savait pour notre enfant.
ll m'a laissé le choix, Sydney.
Le Centre me muterait ailleurs,
verserait une somme importante
pour Nicholas si...
je promettais
de ne plus te revoir.
Et si tu refusais ?
Tu aurais un affreux accident.
Le Centre refusait
que tu sois distrait,
que tu perdes ton objectivité
envers le projet Caméléon.
J'avais peur.
Aprčs mon départ
et la naissance de Nicholas,
j'ai rencontré quelqu'un.
Je me suis mariée.
ll a élevé notre enfant
comme le sien.
On a décidé
de lui cacher la vérité.
On peut lui dire maintenant.
A quel prix ?
C'est un jeune homme brillant,
promis ŕ un bel avenir.
ll sera professeur, comme toi.
Et il va arriver.
Je dois y aller.
J'espčre que tu comprends.
Au moins, cette fois-ci,
on se dit au revoir.
L'inscription sur la montre...
c'était sincčre.
Pour toujours.
J'ai trouvé Ca dans une boîîte.
Vladimir Petrovka.
- Arręté il y a deux ans par...
- Stevens, Cooke et Mooney ?
Petrovka a commencé
ŕ traiter avec la brigade.
Avant l'arrivée de Daniel.
Petrovka a été acquitté
pour vice de forme.
Stevens et les autres
sont payés pour le tuyauter.
Leur pčre avait tout découvert.
D'oů la dispute qu'ils ont entendue.
ll allait les dénoncer.
Et ils l'ont tué.
Ce n'est pas fini.
Pas encore.
Vous partez ?
J'ai vu l'acte de naissance.
Michelle a dit que le Centre
avait menacé de me tuer
si je découvrais que j'avais un fils.
lls m'ont volé ma vie, Parker !
Tout comme celle de Jarod,
- d'Angelo et...
- La mienne ?
En partant maintenant,
vous ne saurez pas qui a fait ça.
Vous n'allez pas vraiment partir ?
Apparemment pas.
Si vous étiez au courant,
pourquoi n'avoir rien dit ?
Tout le monde mérite une vie.
Męme vous.
Comment avez-vous pu rater ?
Vous ne parlez pas de ma cible.
Mais si.
Je parlais aussi de votre 45.
Rendez-vous sur le terrain.
Chacun fera ses preuves.
T14, un individu non-identifié
correspondant
ŕ la description du meurtrier
du lieutenant Lange
a été vu 21B Shore Road.
ll a fait feu.
C'est la patinoire.
Le standard ?
lci le sergent Stevens.
- J'ai bien entendu ?
- Affirmatif.
lntervenez d'urgence.
Allez, on y va !
Du sang.
Le tueur de flic est de retour.
Cette fois, on y va ensemble.
Jarod, attendez mon signal !
- Qu'est-ce qu'il fait ?
- Allons-y.
Cooke, avec moi.
Mooney, couvrez-nous !
- Je n'aime pas ça !
- Moi non plus.
Pręts ? On y va !
C'est Stevens. Répondez.
C'est un ordre !
- Oů il est ?
- Je m'en occuperai aprčs.
Ouvrez l'oeil.
Avancez.
Cessez le feu !
C'est une cible !
C'est quoi ?
ll continue !
Je l'ai dans le viseur.
Des balles ŕ blanc !
On a interverti les munitions.
Vous ętes qui ?
Vous me connaissez.
Je suis celui que vous avez créé.
Le tireur ŕ la casquette
et au bouc.
L'homme que vous avez accusé
du meurtre de Lange.
Quoi ?
Lange avait découvert
votre trafic avec Petrovka.
ll vous l'a dit
et vous l'avez tué
avec des balles
traversant les gilets.
Des tueuses de flics.
ll se trouve que j'en ai.
Vous avez piégé Lange, pas vrai ?
Une idée de Stevens !
Vous avez fait deux orphelins.
Pour quoi ?
Pour de l'argent ?
Ratez votre coup
et on vous fait sauter la cervelle.
Vous avez entendu, Liz ?
Chaque mot.
Celui-ci est chargé.
Vous allez me tuer, Jarod ?
Si je tombe... vous aussi.
C'est fini, Stevens.
ll a raison, Keith.
Un mort, ça suffit, Stevens.
lls ont retrouvé
les parents de Dan.
lls emmčnent les enfants
ŕ Seattle.
lls ont l'air trčs gentil.
Jordan et Cody
vont vous regretter.
Les Lange m'ont invitée
ŕ leur rendre visite.
J'aimerais qu'ils vivent plus prčs.
Je voudrais leur parler
de leur pčre.
Vous pourriez
vous installer lŕ-bas.
Pour faire quoi ? lls n'ont pas
besoin de standardiste lŕ-bas.
Justement, j'ai contacté
un commissariat de Seattle
et ils cherchent quelqu'un de bien
pour un poste de standardiste.
Si ça vous intéresse,
il est ŕ vous.
Merci.
C'est moi qui vous remercie.
De quoi ?
De veiller
ŕ ce que ces enfants sachent
que quelqu'un les aimait.
- Vous partez ?
- On va vivre dans une ferme.
Avec de vrais chevaux.
De vrais chevaux ?
Ecoutez...
- Promettez-moi une chose.
- Quoi ?
Quoi que vous réserve l'avenir,
n'oubliez jamais
que votre pčre vous adorait.
Promis ?
Je n'ai pas vu Sydney ce matin.
ll avait ŕ faire ŕ Albany.
Regardez, Mlle Parker.
Non !
Reculez !
Moi en miniature !
J'ai plus de cheveux que ça...
Comme je l'ai dit,
ça vous va ŕ ravir.
Bravo. A la prochaine fois.
Erica, je voulais vous parler.
Vous pourriez approfondir
votre réflexion.
Etudiez le chapitre 3, d'accord ?
Aucun métier
ne vaut l'enseignement.
Tout le monde me dit ça.
Profitez de la vie.
Elle passe tellement vite.
Je vous connais ?
Je crains que non.
lci Sydney.
Vous avez trouvé votre fils ?
Une fois, je vous ai demandé
si une famille voudrait de moi.
C'est vrai.
Je pensais que c'était le sang
qui unissait les gens.
J'ai appris
qu'il faut autre chose.
ll faut de l'amour.
J'espčre que tu as raison.

Tu l'as déjà fait des tas de fois.
Choisis une photo
et deviens cette personne.
Jarod a déjà refusé de
communiquer, mais pas autant.
Et ses résultats sont déroutants.
Votre stock est...
fascinant.
C'est le mot qu'employait Jarod.
ll était épaté.
ll s'est même essayé
aux jeux de miroirs.
Surtout l'image brisée.
C'est bizarre.
C'est tordu.
Si vous trouvez ça tordu,
regardez ça.
Le palais des glaces de Jarod.
Jarod y passait des heures
à se regarder et à travailler.
Regardez !
Jarod disait que
ça donnait un autre regard
sur son âme.
Dans le développement de l'enfant,
le stade du miroir
est la naissance du soi.
L'enfant découvre
qu'il est distinct de sa mère.
- C'est le début de l'identité.
- Traduction ?
Jarod essaie de reconstruire
une personnalité brisée.
Une vie brisée.
Tout va bien ?
Ca va.
Nicky !
Couche-toi !
Ca va aller.
Ca va.
On m'a enlevé à ma famille.
Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà
plus doué que les autres.
Combien de gens sont morts
à cause de moi ?
Depuis mon évasion,
je cherche mon passé.
C'est un Caméléon.
Un génie qui peut devenir
qui il veut.

Vous êtes médecin ?
Aujourd'hui, oui.
Un enfant de 5 ans

Traumatisme de l'enfant
Trois semaines de silence
Dr Leary.
Non, agent Leary.
Agent spécial Roger Bingham.
Voici Andrew Stess.
Enchanté.
Vous n'avez mis que 30 secondes
avant de plonger sur le gosse.
Un coup de chance.
Vous voulez une médaille ?
J'ai fait mon boulot.
Et pas nous ?
Ecoutez, Freud,
Davis pense qu'un des nôtres
moucharde
sur l'emplacement de l'abri.
Pas la peine d'ajouter
qu'un autre a fait notre boulot.
Si c'est pour devenir un héros,
allez ailleurs.
- Vous êtes encore là ?
- M. Davis.
J'ignore ce qui est pire :
l'embuscade d'hier ou Stess.
On est sous pression.
Si le morpion
ne parle pas,
un caïd de la drogue
s'en tirera.
C'est quoi ?
Nicky a subi un choc.
Ca peut l'aider à sortir du silence.
ll a vu Vasquez descendre
un de nos agents,
les hommes de Vasquez
ont tenté de le tuer
et un jouet va le faire parler ?
Ce n'est pas aussi simple.
Les études montrent que...
Ne le prenez pas mal.
Mais entre nous,
je me fous de vos études.
S'il ne parle pas d'ici 2 jours,
on emploiera ma méthode.
Angelo a été déplacé.
Vous êtes au courant, Mlle Parker ?
Vous me parlez ?
Une heure après son changement,
j'ai été convoqué par la Tour.
Des nettoyeurs fouillent
mes dossiers personnels,
mon bureau, tout.
J'en pleure.
De tels contrôles
n'arrivent pas par hasard.
Si vous êtes derrière tout Ca...
Que ferez-vous ?
Vous me renverrez à la Table T ?
Quels secrets protégez-vous,
Dr Raines ?
Ceux que ma mère avait découverts ?
Ceux qui lui ont coûté la vie ?
Angelo parlera peut-être.
Ou bien est-ce Timmy ?
lci, on sera en sécurité.
Ces jouets sont super.
Voilà ma réserve personnelle
de jouets.
Tu peux prendre ce que tu veux.
ll y a M. Patate,
la boule magique...
Et ça, c'est mon préféré.
J'ai jamais vu de psy armé.
En fait, je suis psychologue

J'utilise souvenirs et émotions

Vous me rendrez mon fils ?
C'est le but.
Pour rebâtir ses souvenirs,
je dois reconstituer
la journée en question.
Je suis infirmière.
J'avais un peu de temps libre
et j'ai emmené Nicky et Charlie
au Lavomatic.
Charlie ?
Le chat de Nicky.
J'ai assis Nicky
sur une chaise.
Je lui ai donné du lait.
J'ai rempli la machine
et j'ai parlé à une dame.
Je n'ai pas vu le temps passer.
J'ai entendu un bruit sec
derrière le bâtiment.
Je me suis retournée.
Nicky avait disparu.
Et ensuite ?
J'ai paniqué.
Je suis sortie en courant.
J'ai vu un homme...
couché par terre.
Où était Nicky ?
ll avait disparu.
Je l'ai cherché partout,
pendant que la dame
appelait la police.
J'avais dit à Nicky
de ne jamais sortir seul.
Mais son chat Charlie...
avait dû sortir.
ll est allé le chercher.
Je parlais à un des flics...
C'est là qu'on l'a trouvé.
Pauvre petit bonhomme.
ll était coincé sous le corps.
Depuis, il ne parle plus.
Vous imaginez sa peur ?
Ca a dû être terrible.
Mort d'un agent corrompu de la DEA
Le gosse a pas dit
que Vasquez avait tué Cruz.
C'est long.
Un coup de pied au cul, ça aide.
Bingham a plus de chances
de gagner à la loterie
que ce gosse
de mettre Vasquez en taule.
Me porte pas la poisse
pour la loterie.
A washington, on dit
que c'est vous qui soupçonniez Cruz
de pas vouloir coffrer Vasquez,
de traiter avec lui et d'utiliser
l'entrepôt
pour stocker sa marchandise.
Seul ce petit garçon sait la vérité.
Espérons qu'avant que Vasquez
le fasse taire pour de bon,
vous laisserez vos jouets
et le ferez parler.
Vous suggérez quoi ?
Un interrogatoire ?
La peur l'a rendu muet.
Elle peut aussi le faire parler.
Je t'ai fait du chocolat au lait.
J'ai entendu parler de cette poudre.
Ca transforme radicalement
la composition du lait, non ?
Vous n'en avez jamais goûté ?
Là où j'ai grandi, c'était interdit.
C'est fou, non ?
Je peux goûter, Nicky ?
Je suis blessée !
Rassurez-vous, je m'occupe de Nicky.
Je veux que la fuite soit colmatée.
Quitte à passer chaque agent
au détecteur de mensonges.
Je me méfie de tout le monde.
Ta maman ira mieux
dès que le médecin l'aura examinée.
En attendant, tu veux qu'on aille
voir ta nouvelle maison ?
Tu crois qu'elle a besoin
d'un lieu sûr ?
Tu peux me faire confiance.
Ca t'ennuie
si je mets autre chose dedans ?
C'est ma mère.
Elle est toujours près de moi.
Tu veilleras sur elle pour moi ?
Bientôt, ce sera moins dur
et tu seras assez fort
pour mettre la douleur en lieu sûr.
Cette maison est bâtie
sur un labyrinthe de tunnels.
Pourquoi avoir construit ça ?
Par paranoïa.
Ceux qui ont tout
redoutent les voleurs.
lls n'ont pas tort.
Ecoutez-moi.
Cette maison est bâtie
sur des tunnels.
Chaque tunnel est relié
aux 4 parties du domaine
avec des entrées et des sorties
dedans et dehors, comme ce système
d'évacuation dans l'allée.
Chaque accès doit être protégé.
Au boulot !
Je veux un vrai médecin.
Qui vous a attaqué ?
Je ne sais pas.
J'essaie de vous aider.
Allons-y.
Tout de suite.
ll ment.
L'anesthésie le fait encore délirer.
ll répétait sans cesse la même chose.
Enid, ça vous dit quelque chose ?
Enid ?
Un ancien employé mécontent ?
Possible. Ces blessures
ne sont pas dues au hasard.
L'agresseur a tracé ça
sur le bras de Raines.
1 55...
La salle où Raines faisait
ses expériences.
Vu la violence,
Enid a pu être
une de ces expériences.
Ma mère essayait de sauver Enid ?
Elle est morte
en tentant d'arrêter Raines.
C'est possible.
Que cherchait-il à faire ?
Blake ? Jackson ? Où vous êtes ?
Nicky, où tu es ?
Je sais que tu as eu peur.
Mais ton numéro marche pas
avec moi.
Regarde-moi quand je te parle !
Dis-moi ce que tu as vu !
Pas maintenant.
J'ai un truc à vous montrer.
Va dans ta chambre, j'arrive.
Regardez-le encore de travers
et sa mère
ne sera pas seule à l'hôpital !
Votre méthode marche pas.
Cette mission
est à part pour vous, hein ?
Vasquez vous tient à coeur.
Vous n'avez pas un mauvais fond
et le silence de ce gamin vous ronge.
C'est vous, le psy.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Séance de thérapie gratuite.
Rien sur Enid.
Mais c'est un nom gallois.
Ca signifie ''vie'' ou ''esprit''.
C'est utile.
Je veux savoir qui est Enid.
Et pourquoi il a attaqué Raines.
Vous êtes sûr
de vouloir affronter Raines ?
Cette tactique s'est retournée
contre votre mère.
Je ne suis pas ma mère.
Ne me demandez pas
de fouiller chez Raines.
Desserrez les fesses.
J'ai une autre idée.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Elle n'a pas l'air en forme.
Je peux peut-être la réparer.
J'essaie ?
Voilà. Elle va mieux.
Je peux jouer ?
Viens ici !
Tu m'as tellement manqué !
Toi aussi, tu m'as manqué.
Tu as parlé !
J'ai entendu.
Un agent de la DEA décoré
Le frère d'un agent
mort d'une overdose
Le cartel Vasquez et la drogue
Vous m'avez étonné.
Comment ça ?
Je ne savais pas
que vous étiez décoré.
Que faites-vous avec mon dossier ?
Voyons un peu. Décoré en 93.
Depuis, vous passez chaque année
en conseil disciplinaire.
Recours à la violence, techniques
d'interrogatoire douteuses.
En termes cliniques, agent Stess,
vous débloquez.
- Vous me fatiguez.
- Votre frère vous adorait.
Mais la drogue a eu raison de lui.
ll voulait peut-être vous égaler.
Ou bien l'overdose était un moyen
d'attirer l'attention.
Je pourrais vous tuer !
Gardez votre rage pour Vasquez.
ll a vendu à votre frère
l'héroïne qui l'a tué.
Je sais que votre frère vous manque.
Le chagrin et la colère
vous aveuglent.
J'ai besoin de votre aide.
Aidez-moi à coincer
l'assassin de Cruz.
Aidez-moi à sauver
la vie de ce gamin.
Que mijote Marmaduke
cette semaine ?
Je n'en suis pas encore à Marmaduke.
Ca n'a pas traîîné.
Depuis quand willie fume ?
Ca y est !
De l'essence.
ll voulait mettre le feu.
- Dans quel but ?
- Effacer les traces de Raines.
- Quelles traces ?
- C'est écrit sur les murs.
Enid.
Regardez !
C'était à David Minor,
hôpital psychiatrique Davidson.
Quelle surprise !
Encore une maison de fous.
Où sont les miroirs ?
Tout ça a été prescrit
à Minor
par un certain Dr williams.
Certains datent de 20 ans.
williams...
Comme william Raines.
Et pour le papier peint ?
Excessif.
- Méthodique.
- Et faux.
Drôle de faCon d'écrire Enid, non ?
Est-ce bien ce qui est écrit ?
La réponse est dans le miroir.
D-A-N-N-l-E.
Qui est Dannie ?
Regardez.
Le compte en banque de Cruz ?
Regardez la dernière transaction.
500 000 le 9 avril.
Le lendemain de la mort de Cruz.
Combien il manquait d'héroïne
lors de la saisie ?
Un demi-million.
Le compte est anonyme.
ll n'y a qu'un numéro.
Comment tu es sorti de...
Tu ne peux pas dormir ?
Tout est à l'abri ?
Tu te souviens de cet homme ?
C'est lui ?
Retourne te coucher.
Si Vasquez est l'assassin,
la photo devrait le traumatiser.
Votre histoire de jouets
marche peut-être.
On n'a pas de vue d'ensemble.
Jarod ne parle pas depuis 36 h.
Mais il montre
des signes de lucidité.
ll essaie de dessiner une image.
Cette femme sans visage.
J'ai décidé d'intervenir.
Tu peux me dire qui c'est ?
Je ne la vois pas.
Qui ça ?
Je ne me souviens pas.
Je ne me souviens plus.
Ta mère ?
Je ne me souviens pas.
Elle a disparu, Sydney.
Elle a disparu.
Enid est en fait Daniel Minor,
un des sujets d'études du Centre.
Son dossier s'arrête en 82.
Juste après l'incendie
du niveau souterrain 27.
Raines n'avait plus la salle 1 55.
ll s'est installé ailleurs.
Diagnostic : dépression légère.
Tu parles !
Une dépression légère
peut être amplifiée.
Manipulation cérébrale ?
Quel que soit
le traitement initial de Dannie,
cela a abouti à des prescriptions
de plus en plus fortes.
Raines soigne la migraine
par la lobotomie.
Une maladie curable
se transforme
en troubles de l'identité...
Des personnalités multiples.
On en connaîît déjà deux.
Dannie et Enid.
Se regarder dans un miroir
peut apaiser ces troubles.
Le miroir reflète l'image
d'un moi unifié.
Ma mère n'a pas pu le sauver.
Elle a essayé, Mlle Parker.
Mais Raines l'en a empêchée.
Regarde.
Tu sais ce que c'est ?
C'est un très joli chapeau.
Et qui es-tu ?
Maman !
Bonjour.
Tout va bien.
Je suis là pour t'aider.
Tu as un chat, non ?
Charlie.
Charlie doit adorer jouer dehors.
C'est ce qui est arrivé ce jour-là ?
Je l'ai trouvé.
Un homme est arrivé.
Deux hommes.
J'étais caché dans les cartons.
Mais toi, tu les voyais.
Ces hommes...
ils avaient l'air mexicain ?
L'un d'eux ?
Et l'autre ?
Jackpot !
M. Jackpot était avec l'autre homme ?
lls avaient des valises ?
Puis ils les ont échangées.
C'est là que ça s'est passé.
Un autre homme est arrivé.
L'agent Cruz.
Et après ?
M. Jackpot a sorti un revolver.
ll a tué l'autre homme !
ll m'est tombé dessus.
J'avais peur,
je ne pouvais pas bouger.
Puis le policier et ta maman
sont arrivés, c'est ça ?
Tu t'en souviens ?
Pendant que je parlais
à la police, l'agent Bingham
te parlait.
ll m'a emmené à l'écart.
Si tu dis quelque chose...
voilà ta maman.
On progresse ?
Rien.
Le transfert aura lieu
demain à 20 h 30.
Pourquoi ?
C'est fini pour le psy.
Le QG réclame le gosse.
On a quoi ?
Des troubles de l'identité
où deux personnalités
sont obligées de cohabiter
dans le même espace.
Jusqu'ici,
on n'a trouvé que celui d'Enid.
Et pas celui de Dannie.
On vous a déjà traité
de drôle d'oiseau ?
Oiseau ?
Drôle, parfois.
Le temps presse. Bute ce gosse
et tu trouveras 5 kg
au sud de Normandy Avenue.
De l'héroïne.
Le gosse sera transféré
demain soir.
Voici l'adresse.
Le fourgon ne doitjamais
quitter l'allée.
Pas de problème.
J'espère que c'est de la bonne.
Sinon, je tejure
que tu finiras comme Cruz.
J'ai vérifié toutes les portes.
Rien.
Ca ne vient pas des portes,
mais des murs.
Faites-moi arrêter.
Tuez-moi, je vous en prie !
Tuez-moi et j'arrêterai.
Je ne suis pas là pour ça, Dannie.
Plaque d'égout
ll est temps d'y aller.
Bonne chance.
Merci.
J'ai pas envie de revoir ce gosse !
Je vais téléphoner.
J'examine le périmètre.
- Ca va ?
- Vive la paranoïa !
Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire ?
Attraper le méchant.
Ne soyez pas aussi choqué.
Survivre à l'explosion
était trop tentant.
Je voulais savoir
le prix de la vie d'un enfant.
Combien ? 5 kg ?
1 0 ?
Ces types croient que Nicky est mort.
Vasquez va réclamer son héroïne.
Je vais devoir vous tuer.
Comme vous avez tué Cruz ?
Avant de tirer, je vous conseille
de vérifier votre came.
Du chocolat.
Je doute qu'ils apprécient.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Vous avez perdu votre langue ?
Pensez à Nicky.
ll assiste à un meurtre,
un cadavre
lui tombe dessus. Vous imaginez
ce que la peur
peut faire à un enfant ?
Et ensuite, vous menacez
de tuer sa mère s'il parle.
Eh bien, il parle.
ll raconte à Davis votre trafic,
le meurtre de Cruz.
Vous n'avez rien contre moi.
Avouez-le.
Je peux arrêter ces types.
J'ai le vrai matos ici.
D'accord, j'ai tué Cruz.
- Donnez-moi la dope.
- A vos ordres.
Vous avez du lait ?
Vous vous remettez vite.
Comment vous vous êtes fait Ca ?
Au hand-ball.
La Tour a trouvé
de nouvelles preuves.
Concernant
mes activités hors programme.
Vous devriez mieux vous entourer.
- Cigarette ?
- Non.
Vous me rappelez quelqu'un.
Quelqu'un qui vous ressemblait
trait pour trait.
Je ne suis pas ma mère.
Ne faites pas l'erreur de l'oublier.
On devrait tous se méfier
des erreurs que l'on fait.
N'est-ce pas ?
Je viens d'avoir l'hôpital.
Dannie a été transféré.
Désormais, c'est mon patient.
Pourquoi Raines l'aurait créé ?
ll voulait faire
un assassin,
ça s'est retourné contre lui.
Dieu seul le sait.
Dieu et le Centre.
Mon instinct était de tuer Dannie.
Mais quand je l'ai regardé,
il m'a supplié de le tuer.
J'ai vu quelqu'un
qui aurait eu sa chance
s'il avait échappé
aux griffes du Centre.
Ce que vous avez vu, c'est vous.
Vasquez et Bingham
ne sont pas près de revenir par ici.
On croit connaîître quelqu'un
et on le connaîît pas.
Vous m'en direz tant !
Merci d'avoir veillé sur elle.
J'ai quelque chose pour toi.
Charlie, tu es revenu à la maison !
Toi aussi, Nicky.
lci Sydney.
On peut oublier
les choses affreuses
qu'on a vécues étant jeune ?
Oublier ? Bien sûr que non.
Mais on peut s'en servir
pour devenir plus fort.
J'essaie d'être fort.
Mais parfois
je ne vois que l'obscurité...
des fragments de moi-même.
Je me sentirai entier, un jour ?
Je ne sais pas, Jarod.
J'espère.
Moi aussi.

Veuillez nous excuser
pour ce retard.
Bon sang !
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Je me suis fait jeter.
Vu la foule qu'il y a,
le contact physique est inévitable.
Je me suis fait jeter de l'avion.
C'était surbooké.
Je vais rater l'inscription
à la fac de San Diego.
Le prochain vol part dans 5 h.
D'ici là, tous mes cours

Tenez. Prenez mon billet.
Je ne suis pas pressé.

Ravi d'avoir passé

Un bel avenir vous attend, Daniel.
Bonne chance.
Je vous souhaite

Merci, Jarod.
Vous me sauvez la vie.
Qu'est-ce que vous avez au doigt ?
J'ai fait de la lutte.
Et votre soirée d'hier ?
Pardon d'avoir demandé.
Tout va bien ?
- Le dossier personnel de Lyle ?
- Mon père veut une liste
des alliés éventuels de Lyle.
Depuis sa mort,
mon père demande au Triumvirat
de lui rendre son poste.
- Mais on lui barre la route.
- Les alliés
de Lyle savent que votre père
s'opposait à lui.
Le fait que vous l'ayez tué augmente
leur réticence
envers cette promotion.
Même mort, Lyle est emmerdant.
On vient de livrer quelque chose

- D'où viennent ces trucs ?
C'est Jarod qui les a envoyés.
Promotion 1 983, lycée Douglas.
Townsend, Nebraska.
Pourquoi nous envoyer ces albums ?
Page 2.
ll y a un badge dans le mien.
Qui est Ricky Sanders ?
Professeur Tom Grier.
Vous avez qui ?
Mme Ricky Sanders.
Vous feriez un joli couple.
Plutôt crever.
Jarod veut
qu'on assiste à cette réunion,
- Mme Sanders.
- Quelle perspicacité !
Normal, vous êtes professeur.
Regardez.
''Ne changez pas,
sauf si vous tenez à rester en vie.''
Jarod nous avertit d'un danger.
Faites une recherche
sur tous ces ploucs.
Sinon je refuse d'aller

L'enfer, c'est l'enfer, Broots.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Le vol 1 05 s'est écrasé
près de San Diego.
ll y a des morts.
Merci, Jarod.
Vous me sauvez la vie.
ll y avait un jeune homme à bord.
Je lui ai donné mon billet.
Daniel Falk.

- Je vous en prie !
Le corps de Daniel Falk

- Diane Post.
Je préfère les humains

Soyez le bienvenu.
On vient d'avoir les clichés
du lieu de l'accident.
Des problèmes mécaniques ?
L'avion venait d'être contrôlé.
On pense à une erreur de pilotage.
Les deux pilotes ont survécu ?
lls ont été hospitalisés.
- Et la boîîte noire ?
- Elle va arriver.
Je veux être là à son ouverture.
Comment je peux ressembler
à ce Ricky Sanders ?
Avalez une montgolfière.
Comment pourra-t-on croire

Dites que vous avez connu

Ca regorgera de poignées
d'amour et de calvities.
Qu'en est-il de Mme Porcinet ?
Pas de photo.
Vous n'êtes pas une ancienne élève.
Ricky a connu sa femme
à l'étranger.
lls sont missionnaires catholiques
en Afrique.
Vous trouvez Ca drôle ?
Que Jarod veuille vous faire passer
pour une missionnaire ?
Vous avez quelque chose
sur le professeur Tom Grier ?
ll n'a passé qu'un semestre
au lycée en 83.
ll enseignait les langues rares.
ll est mort à Hawaii,
il y a 2 ans.
Pour les autres, rien à signaler.
ll y a une liste de personnes
refusant d'être photographiées.
On n'a pas leur photo.
J'ai fait des recherches.
Rien de spécial.
Sauf que deux d'entre eux

Rien n'est plus mort

Réservez-nous des chambres

Jarod s'en est occupé.
Des chambres non-fumeurs.
Parfait.
M. Larson, quelques questions !
Un message
pour les familles des victimes ?
Je suis de tout coeur avec elles.
Ayant failli perdre mon fils,
je partage leur douleur.
Que s'est-il passé ?
ll ne fera aucune déclaration
avant de voir
la Sécurité des Transports.
Mes prières vont vers ceux
qui ont perdu un être cher.
Excusez-nous. Je voudrais
que mon fils se repose.
Merci.
Commençons par le commencement.
Ecoutons ce que le pilote a à dire.
Elle souffre d'un traumatisme
affectant la mémoire.
ll y a peu de chances
qu'elle se rappelle l'accident.
Vous ne pouvez
vraiment rien nous dire ?
Je vous le répète,
je me revois à l'approche
de San Diego.
Je me rappelle les cris.
Mais à part ça...
Je suis navrée.
Merci, Mme wiley.
On se reverra.
Je vous rejoins dehors.
Ca va aller ?
J'ai l'impression qu'on a peint
ma mémoire en noir.
Quand je pense à mes passagers...
mieux vaut peut-être
que je ne me souvienne pas.
Je veux faire quelque chose
de ma vie.
Une fois, j'ai lu cette phrase :
''On n'a qu'un momentpropice
dans la vie. ''
J'ai compris
que la vie était courte.
ll y a eu onze morts.
Et moi, j'ai survécu.
Qu'est-ce que j'ai de particulier ?
Je me revois
à l'approche de San Diego.
Je me rappelle les cris.
ll y a eu onze morts.
Et moi, j'ai survécu.
Qu'est-ce quej'ai de particulier ?
Les gens du Nebraska
sont accueillants !
Ce n'est pas le Nebraska,
mais un centre de rééducation.
Ricky, c'est toi ?
Ce que tu as changé !
Tu as perdu une tonne, mon vieux.
Et ça,
ce doit être...
De quoi je me mêle ?
On te verra peut-être
avec ta dame
à la promenade en charrette.
La promenade en charrette.
D'accord.
Vous savez vous adapter.
Tout est réglé.
Voici la mienne.
Vous deux, vous avez la 305.
- Vous deux ?
- La ville est petite,
Mme Sanders.
Les gens ne doivent pas
se demander
pourquoi vous ne dormez pas
avec votre mari.
Le mini-bar a intérêt à être
plein, sinon on me le paiera.
Je voulais être là
à l'ouverture de ces boîîtes.
On ne savait pas où vous trouver
et le temps presse.
D'après les données,
les gouvernails
de direction étaient mal réglés.
Vu la vitesse réduite
lors de la descente,
l'angle n'a pu être rectifié,
d'où l'accident.
Qui a fait le réglage ?
On ne sait pas.
- L'enregistreur est bloqué.
- Mauvais fonctionnement.
ll n'a pas marché du tout.
Je n'ai jamais vu ça.
C'est rare, mais c'est arrivé.
Ca m'est arrivé une fois
quand j'étais pilote.
ll n'y a pas eu
de problème mécanique,
c'est donc
une erreur de pilotage.
D'où la question...
Quel pilote ?
Mon père m'a appris à jouer.
Vousjouiez au basket
avec le vôtre ?
Je veux que mes parents
soient fiers de moi.
Vous y êtes parvenu, Daniel.

à Airista.
Brandon s'occupera
du planning.
Plus vite il sera
derrière un bureau, mieux ce sera.
Laissez-nous seuls avec Brandon.
Je dirige la compagnie,
mais je suis aussi son père.
Bien sûr,
mais c'est la procédure habituelle.
Si tu me cherches,
je suis dans la salle d'attente.
L'enregistreur n'a pas fonctionné.
On ignore ce qui s'est passé
dans le cockpit.
Mme wiley souffre d'un traumatisme
cérébral. On compte sur vous.
Racontez-nous
les dernières minutes
avant l'accident.
On avait reçu
les instructions d'approche.
J'étais concentré sur la check-list.
Tout semblait calme.
Soudain, on a perdu de la vitesse.
Angela hurlait
à cause de la montagne.
Par le hublot, j'ai vu l'aile
au milieu des arbres.
Vous semblez avoir très chaud.
Vous voulez un peu d'eau ?
Non, c'est à cause des calmants.
Ca me donne de la fièvre.
Je suppose que notre altimètre
a mal fonctionné.
Selon la boîîte noire,
tous les systèmes marchaient.
Mais les gouvernails de direction
étaient sur 0
au lieu de 20 degrés.
D'où la perte de vitesse.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Vous avez une idée ?
- C'est très dur.
Angela est une amie.
On a fait des tas de vols ensemble.
Mais ?
Quand j'ai lu
''gouvernails à 20 degrés''
sur la check-list,
Angela a répondu par l'affirmative.
Je suppose qu'elle ne faisait pas
attention.
L'erreur vient du pilote,
Angela wiley.
- Peut-être.
- Que voulez-vous de plus ?
ll a dit
qu'il prenait des calmants.
Ceux-ci sont à la fois
analgésiques et sédatifs.
lls ne donnent pas de fièvre.
Et s'il était
nerveusement épuisé ?
Les pilotes sont humains.
Si je dénonçais un ami,
je transpirerais aussi.
Vous croyez vraiment, Diane ?
Si vous considériez ça
comme des vacances,
vous pourriez vous amuser.
Ces gens sont morts
et ne le savent même pas.
Pourquoi ?
Parce qu'un couple est marié
depuis 1 4 ans,
va à l'église le dimanche
et assiste
aux matches de ses enfants ?
Si mon ex et moi,
on avait eu cette chance...
Vous avez dû vous assommer
en tombant du camion de navets !
En quoi votre vie est géniale ?
Vous êtes coincée au Centre
pour attraper un type,
hantée par le meurtre de votre mère.
Votre père s'intéresse plus
à un fou chauve qu'à vous.
Attention !
Ce que je veux dire,
c'est que je préfère
un sermon et un match
à ça.
Jarod nous envoie un autre album
avec la liste
des élèves absents
le jour de la photo de fin d'année.
''Chaque photo ne raconte pas
une histoire.'' Ca veut dire ?
De se pencher
sur ceux qui ont refusé la photo.
Tu viens,
mon chéri ?
Vous ne serez pas accusée
d'homicide par imprudence...
Mais de négligence.
Contactez votre syndicat
pour avoir un avocat.
L'enregistreur a mal fonctionné.
Nous n'avons que le témoignage
de Brandon.
Si vous vous rappelez
quoi que ce soit...
Je ne me souviens de rien.
L'enregistreur
n'a pas mal fonctionné.
Le cylindre a été démagnétisé.
Comment ça va ?
Du nouveau sur les absents ?
J'ai trouvé deux candidats
au titre d'idiot du village.
- Et vous ?
- J'en ai vu une.
Femme de fermier, sept enfants,
plein de photos dans son sac.
Devine avec qui il est marié ?
Zena. Quel est ton secret ?
Quelle question !
Je n'avais jamais vu
de missionnaire.
Pas possible !
Et Ricky ! Qui aurait cru
qu'il deviendrait religieux ?
On est sortis ensemble
quelques fois, vous savez.
ll vous a déjà parlé de moi ?
ll se souvient souvent
d'avoir titillé vos amygdales
le samedi soir dans la grange.
Avant de clore cette soirée,
je voudrais
évoquer deux élèves
qui ont été rappelés
auprès du Seigneur.
La première est
- Diana Hydra.
- C'est presque fini.
On ne sait toujours pas
pourquoi Jarod
nous a envoyés ici.
Vous vous rappelez sa mort
au cours de sa dernière année.
Nous n'avons pas de photo
de Bobby Bowman,
mais nous avons pu agrandir
une photo de groupe
du club des Fermiers de demain.
- Je m'en vais.
- Mlle Parker !
La ressemblance est indubitable.
Bobby Bowman est M. Lyle ?
C'est bien le dossier
de Brandon Larson ?
Ce labo ne peut pas
se permettre d'erreurs.
Quelque chose cloche.
Le dernier bilan microstatique
de Brandon Larson donne 1 0.
Mais après le crash,
le chiffre passe à 1 5.
Je pensais
que ce taux était invariable.
En effet.
Qui a apporté ces prélèvements ?
L'enquêteur en chef, Clark Thomas.
Ne vous laissez pas perturber
par Jarod.
Et la sueur de Brandon ? ll dit
que les calmants ne fontpas ça.
La preuve est très claire.
Préparez le rapport pour demain.
On a voulu me détourner
du droit chemin.
Mais mon père m'a dit
de suivre mon instinct.
J'ai résisté.
Que vous a appris votre père,
Clark ?
Vous me sauvez la vie.
J'ai donné mon billet d'avion
à un jeune homme.
L'avion s'est écrasé.
Je suis désolé.
On veut tous croire
que l'on peut contrôler
les événements de la vie.
Mais ça n'est qu'une illusion.
ll avait
toutes les raisons de vivre.
Une famille.
De l'avenir.
Maintenant, il a disparu...
et je suis toujours là.
J'ai peur qu'on puisse
passer toute notre vie
à débattre du destin, Jarod.
Toute une vie ?
Ca fera mal aussi longtemps ?
- Du nouveau ?
- J'ai le dossier de la police
sur Bobby Bowman.
Selon le rapport
- du médecin légiste...
- Par ici, Broots.
Selon ce rapport,
Bobby Bowman a été assassiné
il y a 1 6 ans. Par son père.
M. Lyle, alias Bobby Bowman,
a mis en scène
son meurtre
et fait accuser son père ?
Et je trouvais ma famille tordue !
On a trouvé son corps décapité
dans la camionnette de son père.
Mais le corps était si décomposé
qu'on n'a pas vraiment pu
l'identifier.
La décapitation
élimine l'examen dentaire
et la décomposition rend
le relevé d'empreintes impossible.
Si ce corps
n'était pas celui de M. Lyle,
alors à qui était-il ?
Broots, revenez à Blue Cove.
Retracez les débuts de Lyle
au Centre.
Et nous ?
On va rendre visite à Mamie Nova.
On avait adopté Bobby.
C'était un bon garçon,
dans l'ensemble.
Puis quand il a eu environ 1 5 ans,
il y a eu un déclic.
A table, les petits !
Un jour, il était
doux comme un agneau
et le lendemain,
méchant comme tout. Et violent.
Au bout d'un moment,
mon mari ne l'a plus supporté.
Pour lui,
Bobby avait besoin de discipline.
ll a commencé à l'enfermer
dans l'abri de jardin.
Je trouvais ça un peu dur.
Mais comme disait mon mari,
le toit ne fuyait pas
et il n'y avait pas de vermine.
Les deux chiens,
arrêtez d'aboyer
et rentrez !
C'est un ami de Bobby ?
Jimmy Radloff.
Mais il est mort.
C'était une triste journée
pour Bobby.
Comment Jimmy est mort ?
Un jour, Bobby et Jimmy
sont partis en randonnée.
lls se sont séparés
et Bobby est rentré seul.
Jimmy a disparu
sans laisser aucune trace.
On l'a cherché partout,
on n'a jamais trouvé son corps.
Ca suffit !
Taisez-vous et ramenez-vous ici !
On sait quel corps Lyle a utilisé
pour maquiller sa mort.
Personnellement, je crois
que Jimmy a fait une fugue.
ll venait d'une famille terrible.
Son père était un ivrogne
et sa mère...
Lyle et moi, on a toujours pensé
qu'elle était folle à lier.
Lyle ?
Le nom de mon mari.
Mais il tenait à ce que Bobby
l'appelle monsieur.
Angela ?
A l'hôpital, on m'a dit
que vous étiez sortie.
Je peux entrer ?
ll fait sombre ici, non ?
Ce n'est pas la solution.
Tout ce que je voulais,
c'est être pilote.
Ce sont des conclusions
préliminaires.
Rien n'a été décidé.
On m'a dit de prendre un avocat.
C'est la procédure de routine.
ll y aura des procès.
Je n'oserai jamais
affronter ces familles.
Ecoutez-moi.
Je pense
que vous n'êtes pas responsable.
Qu'est-ce qui vous fait dire ça ?
Ceux qui y ont laissé leur vie
n'ont pas eu le choix.
Ne déshonorez pas leur souvenir
en supprimant la vôtre.
Aidez-moi à prouver votre innocence.
Après la disparition
de Jimmy Radloff,
Bobby est devenu de pire en pire.
On n'avait aucun moyen
de le maîîtriser,
à part en l'enfermant
dans l'abri.
Une fois, il a frappé son père
avec une pelle. Je suis sûre
que c'est la goutte d'eau
qui a poussé Lyle à tuer Bobby.
Et à le décapiter ?
J'ai trouvé ça un peu excessif.
Où est votre mari, maintenant ?
Régime cellulaire,
prison de Topeka.
Lyle ne caresse pas les gens
dans le sens du poil.
ll faut que je prépare le souper.
L'abri mesure 2,5 x 3 m.
Comme une cellule de prison.
Si mon père m'avait enfermée
dans un trou pareil,
je l'aurais tué.
M. Lyle a visiblement choisi
un châtiment
plus long.
Hélas, il ne s'est pas limité
à son père.
Désolé de vous déranger.
J'ai une nouvelle troublante.
Votre fils consommait
des substances illégales.
- C'est ridicule.
- Peut-être.
Mais de telles accusations
nécessitent une enquête.
Si mon fils avait fait
cette bêtise, je le saurais.
Vous savez combien
de candidats briguent
une place dans le cockpit
d'une grande compagnie ?
Certains mentiraient
pour prendre la place d'un pilote.
J'en suis certain.
Pourquoi risquer son avenir
en prenant ces substances ?
D'ailleurs,
je ne le laisserais pas faire.
Je n'ai pas le choix.
On a toujours le choix.
Dites ça aux victimes du vol 1 05.
- Clark Thomas.
- Jarod Lindsay estpassé.
ll va ouvrir une enquête
concernant la consommation
de substances illégales
par mon fils.
- D'où il tient ça ?
- Peu importe.
Ce qui compte,
c'est que vous avez promis
d'étouffer ça.
Au travail.
Reconstitution des données
Mon amie m'a donné ça.
Elle a peur queje l'oublie.
C'est bien d'avoir quelqu'un
qui tient à vous.
En plus des parents.
Reconstitution terminée
Le gouvernail est à zéro. J'avais dit
de monter de deux crans.
- On passera pas la crête !
- Pardon !
- Redresse !
- Je suis désolé ! Mon Dieu !
J'avais dit de monter de deux
crans. On passera pas la crête !
Redresse !
Le gouvernail est à zéro. J'avais dit
de monter de deux crans.
On passera pas la crête !
- Redresse !
- Je suis désolé ! Mon Dieu !
C'est une mauvaise plaisanterie ?
Non. Ce que je considère
comme une mauvaise plaisanterie,
c'est d'anéantir la carrière d'Angela
pour sauver la vôtre.
Vous êtes fou.
Vraiment ?
Ce n'est pas elle qui est
responsable du crash, mais vous.
Clark Thomas n'a pas remis
votre sang au labo.
Vous ne voliez pas, vous planiez.
Vous marchiez à quoi ?
Aux amphétamines pour aiguiser
vos sens ?
C'est pour ça que vous transpirez ?
- C'est faux.
- Vous savez qu'Angela
voulait se tuer parce qu'elle avait
On arrondit à une douzaine ?
Tout ça à cause de vous.
Pour avoir un poste chez Airista
et faire plaisir à votre père.
On n'a pas droit à l'erreur
avec mon père.
ll faut être parfait.
Sinon, il graisse la patte
à Clark Thomas pour régler ça ?
ll a découvert que je prenais
de la drogue après l'accident
et il s'est acharné
à contrôler Ca comme le reste.
ll a choisi mes écoles,
mes petites amies, ma carrière.
Jusqu'où ça doit aller
pour que vous disiez non ?
Vous ne comprenez pas !
Personne ne dit non à mon père.
Ni moi ni Clark Thomas. Personne.
Vous ne pensez pas
qu'il est temps que ça change ?
M. Bowman, parlez-nous
de votre fils, Bobby.
Je détestais ce petit salaud.
Mais je ne l'ai pas tué.
Qui l'a tué ?
Si je le savais,
je ne serais pas là.
Je parierais sur le conseiller
qui a commencé à venir
quand Bobby a eu 1 5 ans.
De l'agence d'adoption.
ll voulait voir
comment allait Bobby.
Bobby allait bien avant son arrivée.
lls ont commencé à se voir.
- Trop souvent.
- Vous vous souvenez
- de ce conseiller ?
- Mon avocat
a essayé de le trouver
après mon arrestation.
Mais il ne travaillait pas
pour l'agence d'adoption.
Ces cadenas découpés au mur...
que signifient-ils, M. Bowman ?
Une mauvaise plaisanterie.
J'en reçois
un par mois depuis mon arrivée ici.
Je m'en sers pour garder
la notion du temps.
Mais le mois dernier,
je n'en ai pas reçu.
Parce que M. Lyle est mort.
Je veux
vous faire écouter quelque chose.
Clark ? C'est Jarod.
J'ai quelque chose à vous montrer.
Un avion de parachutisme ?
Vous auriez pu en prendre un autre.
Que faites-vous ici ?
Lindsay a trouvé quelque chose
sur le lieu du crash.
Parfait.
Tout le monde est là.
On y va ?
Je regrette, M. Larson.
ll y a eu un malentendu.
ll n'y a pas de malentendu.
J'ai du nouveau
sur la cause du crash.
De quoi s'agit-il ?
ll faut le voir pour le croire.
- Pourquoi est-on si bas ?
- Pour simuler la descente
du vol 1 05.
Vous me remplacez une minute ?
Je dois aller à l'arrière.
Prenez ma place,
la vue est meilleure.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a découvert ?
Tout ce qui restait
sur la montagne a été examiné.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
ll a sauté !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Prenez de l'altitude.
C'est bloqué.
Le système hydraulique est coincé.
Un problème, les gars ?
Vous savez ce qu'a éprouvé Angela
en comprenant
qu'elle allait s'écraser.
Vous avez un moyen de survivre.
Mais ça a un prix.
Que voulez-vous ?
La vérité. Sur la façon
dont vous avez acheté Clark Thomas
pour cacher le fait
que votre fils était responsable
du crash du vol 105.
Vous êtes sans voix, hein ?
Attention.
Ce que vous dites est enregistré.
Clark ne pourra pas
démagnétiser le cylindre.
lmpact dans 70 secondes.
Quand on découvrira
les restes de l'avion,
on fera des tests
de toxicologie sur votre corps.
Vous avez quelque chose
à cacher, M. Larson ?
Quel dommage !
Clark ne pourra plus trafiquer
les examens de sang.
50 secondes.
Bon sang, Jarod !
D'accord, je l'ai fait !
J'ai été acheté !
Déverrouillez le système !
Et vous, M. Larson ?
Dites-le-lui !
Votre réputation
compte plus que votre vie ?
On va s'écraser ! Avouez !
D'accord, c'est vrai,
j'ai payé Clark Thomas
pour protéger mon fils.
Clark, il y a un bouton
sous votre siège.
Appuyez dessus.
Ca a failli ! Autre chose...
Vous avez du carburant
jusqu'à San Diego.
Au fait, une voiture de police
vous attend là-bas.
Je ne crois pas
à votre théorie sur Lyle.
Ecoutez, Mlle Parker.
Tout ce que je dis,
c'est que si Lyle a pu
mettre en scène sa mort
à 1 5 ans,
il a peut-être recommencé.
Et c'est ce que Jarod
voulait nous dire.
Lyle est vivant.
J'ai tué cet enfoiré, Sydney.
Je l'ai vu tomber à l'eau.
Vous étiez là
quand on a repêché son corps.
Un corps sans tête.
- Et alors ?
- Exactement
- comme la dernière fois.
- ll n'y a pas de dernière fois !
ll est mort.
ll n'y a rien sur Lyle,
à part sa date d'embauche
et sa date de licenciement.
Mais j'ai trouvé ça
au nom de Bobby Bowman.
Les papiers d'adoption
donnant la garde de Bobby...
de M. Lyle aux Bowman.
ll n'y a qu'une raison pour que
le Centre ait ces papiers.
Je m'en suis occupé.
- Je veux qu'on exhume le corps.
- C'est impossible.
Le Centre a fait incinérer M. Lyle.
La vérité sur le crash
Merci, Jarod.
Vous m'avez sauvé la vie.
Je peux vous aider ?
C'était à Daniel.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
J'ai rencontré Daniel
en attendant l'avion.
ll était surbooké
et on l'avait refusé.
ll s'inquiétait
pour son inscription.
Je ne comprends pas.
J'ai donné ma place sur ce vol
à votre fils.
Je suis vraiment désolé.
Je pensais que vous...
Mieux vaut que je parte.
Attendez.
Vous voulez entrer...
pour nous parler de notre fils ?
Merci, Jarod.
Vous me sauvez la vie.

Etes-vous très forte ?
Essayez.
Vous avez un message.
Détiens information importante
sur ton passé, présent et avenir.
Rejoins-moi à Dry River,
Arizona. Sydney.
Je suis pas d'ici
et je cherche un ami.
Vous l'auriez vu ?
Sans vous déranger,
vous pourriez me regarder ?
lls n'entendent pas.
Ce sont les frères Mitchell.
Sourds comme des pots.
- lls disent...
- ''ll va faire chaud.''
Vous comprenez les signes ?
- Adjoint Miller.
- Jarod...
Barber.
Les visiteurs sont rares,
à Dry River.
Qu'est-ce qui vous amène ?
Je viens retrouver un ami.
Vous l'avez peut-être vu.
La cinquantaine, l'air distingué...
Je m'en souviendrais.
Je vous ai assez dérangée.
- Bonne journée.
- Vous allez rester avec nous.
Suivez-moi, monsieur.
Pourquoi donc ?
Parce que sinon,
je vais devoir vous tuer.
On m'a enlevé à ma famille.
Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà
plus doué que les autres.
Combien de gens sont morts
à cause de moi ?
Depuis mon évasion,
je cherche mon passé.
C'est un Caméléon.
Un génie qui peut devenir
qui il veut.
- Le Centre le veut vivant.
- De préférence.
ll défend les opprimés.
La vie est un don.
Vous êtes médecin ?
Aujourd'hui, oui.
Pas terrible,
ce tuyau anonyme sur Jarod.
ll a dit qu'on trouverait
ce qu'on cherchait.
Si on cherchait une ruine
empestant l'urine,
il aurait vu juste.
Ce serait une fausse piste ?
Merci, Sherlock.
Rose ?
Debbie a fait la lessive.
Elle a mélangé
la couleur et le blanc.
Je ne veux pas la vexer.
Bonjour les dégâts.
Je veux une équipe
de nettoyeurs.
Que tout ce qu'ils trouvent
soit ramené au Centre.
Venez voir.
Ca va ?
La carte de votre mère.
La date d'expiration
a été changée.
Jarod n'était pas si grinçant,
la dernière fois que je l'ai eu.
J'ai raté un truc ?
La nouvelle date d'expiration,
c'est le jour
où sa mère a été tuée.
Quand on se fait arrêter,
on a le droit de téléphoner.
Vous êtes ici pour répondre
à des questions.
Sur quoi ?
Le shérif Delmont vous expliquera
à son retour.
C'est insensé.
Suivez le courant
et y aura pas de bobo.
Venez vite ! C'est J.R.
Qu'est-il arrivé ?
On jouait au foot
et il s'est évanoui.
- Appelle le Dr Craner.
- ll est à Tucson.
J.R. est étendu dans l'église.
J'ai des notions de médecine.
ll s'agit de mon fils.
Je peux vous aider.
Poussez-vous.
J.R. chéri !
Tu m'entends ?
ll est en état de choc.
- ll respire.
- ll est hypoglycémique.
Quand a-t-il mangé ?
ll a mangé des céréales
il y a 4 h.
Et de l'eau.
ll va s'en tirer ?
Mon chéri !
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
ll lui faut du sucre.
Prends ça.
Laisse-le fondre.
C'est bien.
Ca va, mon chéri.
Tout va bien.
Comment va-t-il ?
Mieux.
ll est cardiaque.
Ses doigts et ses lèvres
sont bleuâtres.
Apparemment, c'est congénital.
Votre fils est très malade.
Vous êtes médecin ?
Pas en ce moment.
Pourquoi il n'a pas eu
de greffe de coeur ?
ll est sur liste d'attente.
Parce qu'il est AB négatif,
ce qui est très rare.
Ca n'arrive
qu'à certaines familles.
Une personne sur 300 000.
Je sais.
C'est mon cas.
C'est lui ?
J'ai peut-être trouvé Jarod.
J'ai reçu cet e-mail de lui.
Et vous ne lui avez pas
envoyé ce message ?
Est-ce que je vous le montrerais ?
ll n'a pas tort.
C'est quoi, Dry River ?
D'après l'ordinateur, c'est
dans le sud-ouest de l'Arizona.
lci Parker.
Préparez le jet.
Sortez-le du hangar.
Trouvez-moi une place
sur le prochain vol
- pour...
- Phoenix.
Je prendrai le billet là-bas.
Vous partez seule ?
Je suis grande.
Faites travailler la Chose.
Angelo.
J'ai horreur des impasses,
surtout s'agissant de ma mère.
Tenez ça.
ll a réanimé J.R.
et on l'a ramené ici.
Très touchant.
Shérif, il aurait pu s'échapper,
mais il ne l'a pas fait.
- Et alors ?
- ll a sauvé mon fils.
ll doit y avoir
une autre solution.
Non.
Vous avez été bien
avec le petit.
Si vous me cherchez des noises,
je vous descends.
Vous comprenez ?
Complètement.
Allons-y.
Heureusement que j'étais là.
Votre adjoint
a un fils très malade.
ll aurait pu mourir.
Ca doit être dur de voir quelqu'un
qu'on aime souffrir comme ça.
Et vous, shérif ?
Vous avez des enfants ?
Evitons de faire connaissance.
Sortez. On y va.
Tout droit.
Avancez ! Par là.
Restez là.
- Quelqu'un s'est coupé ?
- Asseyez-vous là.
Apparemment,
une chose terrible est arrivée.
Dites-moi quoi.
- lmpossible.
- Pourquoi ?
Je l'en empêcherai.
Lyle.
Parti, mais pas oublié.
Et voilà comment
tout commence.
Tout ça vient de l'impasse.
Vous pensez qu'il nous aidera ?
Les empathiques
suivent leur propre rythme.
On ne peut ni les presser,
ni les décourager.
Ni les dégoûter.
Jarod a dû croire le signal
''refuge'' authentique.
Avec le tuyau percé
de tout à l'heure,
il devient clair
qu'on l'a attiré en Arizona.
- Jarod serait en danger ?
- Je le crois.
Mais qui le menace ?
Angelo, arrête cinq minutes !
Attendez.
ll ne l'attrape pas.
Pourquoi ?
La personne qu'il ressent
n'a pas de pouce.
J'ai été K.O. longtemps ?
Quelques heures.
Elle sera bonne.
Le message venait de toi ?
Tu es un vrai génie.
Tu as découvert le ''refuge'' ?
Tu oublies qu'avant d'être
sans pouce dans le désert,
j'étais chef rat
à l'usine de fromage.
Tu as pris des DSA,
mais j'ai vu les vidéos
de tes conversations
avec Sydney.
T'as fait une de ces têtes
en me voyant...
Ca valait le coup.
Ton pouce est vilain.
Soigne-le ou tu perdras la main.
Ca ira.
Les gens d'ici te sont dévoués.
Le shérif Delmont ?
Son dévouement
est une question de survie.
Comment ça ?
En arrivant
dans cette petite oasis,
je me suis assuré un atout :
Mme Delmont.
Tu as enlevé sa femme ?
Je l'ai enterrée dans le désert.
Elle respire de l'oxygène
issu d'un générateur à essence
de 5 chevaux.
Avec une capacité de 70 litres,
elle devrait tenir
- environ...
- 1 6 h.
A peu près.
Je surveille l'heure.
ll doit lui rester de quoi vivre
environ 7 h et 20 mn.
Tu vas apprécier ça :
elle est enceinte.
D'environ six mois.
Notre bon shérif
est obligé de coopérer.
Tu es fou.
Un diagnostic psychologique,
c'est subjectif.
- Que veux-tu ?
- Ce n'est pas clair ?
Je veux tout.
Lyle est vivant.
- Comment ?
- Angelo a réagi violemment
à l'un des objets de l'impasse.
Je suis sûr que Lyle
est derrière tout ça.
On en a déjà parlé.
Lyle est mort.
Je l'ai tué à bout portant.
Réfléchissez.
Vous étiez là quand on a sorti
son corps du fleuve.
ll n'a jamais été identifié
de façon certaine.
Adolescent, Lyle a feint sa mort.
ll peut recommencer.
Tu as ce que tu voulais.
Relâche la femme.
Pas avant la fin des négociations.
Le Triumvirat s'apprête
à élire mon remplaçant.
Je compte rendre ce vote
superflu.
Pas facile, la cravate !
Tu crois que le Centre
te laissera revenir ?
Je leur ramène leur fils chéri,
les affaires reprennent.
ll y aura des changements,
des obstacles à supprimer.
Sydney et Mlle Parker ?
Entre autres.
Combien de temps
avant qu'ils te suppriment ?
Rien n'est éternel.
Mais il y a moyen
d'asseoir notre pouvoir.
''Notre'' ?
Avec ton cerveau
et mon sens du commandement,
on peut tout accomplir.
Je peux être ton ami.
Comme quand tu as arrêté
mon coeur ?
Pourquoi voulais-tu me tuer ?
Mon adjoint vient d'appeler.
Une grande brune
pose des questions
sur un certain Jarod
et un homme sans pouce.
Tout allait si bien !
Rien n'est éternel.
Si vous tenez à votre femme,
débarrassez-vous d'elle.
Maintenant.
ll y a 2 hommes très dangereux
à Dry River.
Vous êtes de la police ?
D'une firme privée.
Nous recherchons ces hommes.
Vous les avez vus ?
- Ces gens sont morts ?
- Assassinés. De sang-froid.
- Et lui ?
- Jarod.
C'est un malade mental.
Sa famille le recherche.
Jamais vu.
Mes sources sont sûres.
C'est une petite ville.
Navré, je ne sais rien.
Tout va bien ?
Très bien, J.R.
Ca va ?
Un peu fatigué.
Tu as besoin de repos.
Et de manger.
Gentil garçon.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
ll est mourant.
Appelons quelqu'un !
- Qui ?
- Le FBl...
Pour quoi faire ?
Tu as vu la photo ?
C'est un tueur.
ll a enterré ma femme.
On ne peut pas...
Si ce dingue croit
que je le trahis,
Linda et le bébé sont morts.
Ca ne m'étonne pas.
Quoi donc ?
Cette résurrection
à laquelle tu joues.
Tu as fait le même coup
au lycée,
mais tu étais plus original.
Tu as tué ton meilleur ami
et fait accuser ton père.
- Que sais-tu de mon père ?
- Qu'il moisit en prison
pour un crime que tu as commis.
ll le méritait.
Et ta mère ?
Elle méritait son sort ?
Je t'ai dit que je l'avais vue ?
Une gentille dame,
mais un peu perdue.
Elle nourrissait des chiens
qui n'existaient pas.
- Tu n'as pas pu y aller.
- J'ai laissé ta chambre
comme elle était : douillette.
Encore un mot et tu es mort.
Si tu me tues,
tu n'auras rien à marchander.
Ce qui nous amène
à l'étape nl2.
Sans te contrarier,
c'est illégal
de jouer au docteur.
Très drôle.
J'ai besoin de concret
pour prouver
ma bonne volonté
au Triumvirat.
Une offrande, si tu veux.
Estime-toi heureux.
Tu dormiras
quand je te couperai le pouce.
Elle m'a montré une photo
de vous avec des cadavres.
Dommages collatéraux.
- Autre chose ?
- Je veux ma femme !
Vous avez ce que vous vouliez.
Déjà vu un être humain étouffer ?
Ce n'est pas une mort facile.
Votre famille a encore
un peu moins de 3 h de vie...
sauf si vous voulez m'arrêter.
C'est Parker.
- Elle m'a suivie.
- Débarrassez-vous-en.
Maintenant.
- lls sont là.
- Je ne sais rien, Mlle Parker.
Comment savez-vous mon nom ?
Je ne sais pas
de quoi il vous menace,
mais ça finira mal.
Laissez-moi vous aider.
J'aimerais bien...
Je vous arrête pour effraction.
Donnez-moi votre arme.
Ne fais pas ça.
Ne résiste pas à l'anesthésie.
Tu ne peux rien faire.
- Raines te disait mort.
- Loin de là.
On m'a dit que tu étais mort.
Loin de là, grand frère.
Vous avez reçu ça.
De qui ?
Je ne sais pas.
C'est quoi ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Qui a pu les prendre ?
Je décide de qui vit ou meurt.
Kyle.
Le frère de Jarod
est vivant aussi.
C'est la nuit des morts vivants !
Sydney. Je veux des places
sur le prochain vol pour l'Arizona.
Que l'hélicoptère du Centre
soit prêt à décoller à Phoenix.
Je désespérais
de te voir éveillé.
Je te croyais mort.
C'était voulu.
Je t'ai vu dans le camion
et je l'ai vu exploser.
Tu l'as vu exploser,
mais je n'y étais pas.
Quand tu es parti,
j'ai pu sortir
et tirer dans le réservoir.
J'étais blessé à la jambe.
J'ai fait du stop.
Comment m'as-tu trouvé ?
J'espérais que Parker
me mènerait à toi.
Mon pouce et toute ma personne
en sont ravis !
Jarod, tu as appris autre chose
sur nos parents ?
Sydney m'a donné ça.
Son frère lui a donné
avant de mourir.
Le nom de papa ?
J'en sais rien.
J'en reviens pas.
Où étais-tu ?
Dans l'ombre. J'attendais.
Je guettais.
Je t'ai retrouvé,
alors je peux en finir.
Avec quoi ?
J'ai envoyé des photos
pour attirer les autres ici.
C'est presque fini, frangin.
On commence par Lyle.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
ll s'est cogné la tête.
On a moins d'une heure.
De quoi tu parles ?
Lyle a enlevé une femme
et l'a enterrée dans le désert.
Dans 1 h, elle n'aura plus d'air.
On ne peut pas partir.
C'est l'occasion d'en finir.
Commençons par lui.
Tu m'as entendu ?
Une femme enceinte
est enterrée dans le désert.
Ensemble, on peut la sauver.
Lyle et les autres
méritent de mourir.
S'ils meurent, comment
trouverons-nous nos parents ?
Je sais que tu es en colère,
mais la vengeance n'est pas tout.
Ca fait du bien
de sauver une vie
au lieu d'en détruire une.
On doit savoir
où il l'a enterrée.
T'inquiète, frangin.
Regarde-moi faire.
Vous aimez le pain de viande ?
J'en raffole.
Votre fils est malade ?
ll est cardiaque, oui.
Je suis désolée.
ll avait l'air charmant.
- ll l'est.
- Dites-moi ce qui se passe.
Je ne peux pas.
Ma mère est morte
quand j'avais l'âge
de votre fils.
Je sais que c'est dur
de perdre un être cher.
Et je vous jure que le shérif
et tous ceux que Lyle tient
mourront
si je ne sors pas d'ici.
- Vous ne comprenez pas.
- Si, parfaitement.
Vous devriez encore regarder
ces photos,
car c'est ce qui arrivera
si vous ne faites rien.
Vous ignorez...
ll a enterré vivante
la femme du shérif
dans le désert.
Alors, le temps presse.
On doit pas être loin.
Eteins le moteur.
ll y a un générateur.
Ca vient de là-haut.
Par ici.
Le voilà.
ll n'y a plus d'essence.
Trouve le tuyau.
Ca y est.
Creuse.
- C'est scellé.
- Attention !
Vite. Elle manque d'air.
Ca va aller.
Vous êtes sauvée.
Vous êtes sauvée.
Vous allez quelque part ?
Content de vous revoir.
Pas moi.
Qu'est-ce qui vous est arrivé ?
Le petit frère de Jarod
voulait un renseignement.
Kyle est ici ?
On a négocié.
J'ai perdu.
Plus personne ne meurt ?
C'était vous, l'enveloppe.
Comment le savez-vous ?
Jarod est un chieur,
mais pas sans coeur.
Pour ma mère...
et pour moi.
Vous êtes belle, en colère.
Tu n'as rien ?
J'ai eu si peur.
- Où est-il ?
- Ligoté dans le hangar.
ll faut t'asseoir.
Tout va bien, maintenant.
- Vous faites quoi ?
- A votre avis ?
- On s'en charge.
- ll a failli tuer ma famille.
Vous devez
les emmener à l'hôpital
pour être sûr que Ca va.
Soyez prudents.
Vous en faites pas.
Je suis pas un héros.
La fonderie
est à l'entrée de la ville.
- Pas dans la remorque.
- Ni dans le bâtiment.
ll est parti.
Donc il est dehors.
Quelque part.
Retournons à l'hôpital
voir la femme du shérif.
Tu avais raison, tu sais ?
A quel propos ?
Ca fait du bien d'aider quelqu'un.
Quand cette femme
m'a serré dans ses bras,
je n'avais jamais ressenti ça.
J'étais si plein de haine
et de vengeance,
que j'avais oublié ce que c'était
de se soucier de quelqu'un.
Tout ça va changer,
maintenant qu'on est réunis.
Je te le promets.
Allons-y.
Charmant !
Heureux en famille ?
Tu es cuit, Lyle.
Tu n'as plus d'issue.
Tu me déçois, Jarod.
Tu me connais,
je ne meurs pas facilement.
Lâche Ca, petit.
- Tire, crétin !
- La ferme !
Bouge pas,
ou je troue ton grand frère.
Des menaces.
C'est tout ce que tu nous donnes.
Tu as volé notre vie,
détruit notre esprit
et tu veux nous tuer ?
On s'en fout, Lyle.
Ca ne changera rien.
Je vais le tuer.
Je vais le faire.
Alors je te tuerai.
Ne fais pas ça.
Au fait, Lyle...
et cette plaie ?
Reste avec moi.
Je t'emmène à l'hôpital.
C'est trop tard, Jarod.
Ne dis pas ça !
Regarde-moi !
Je t'en prie, pense...
à tout ce qu'on va vivre ensemble.
Excuse-moi, Jarod.
Pour quoi ?
Pour tout.
On rentre au bercail, Jarod.
Où est Lyle ?
On le trouvera.
Personne ne bouge.
Je ne vous connais pas,
mais je vous dois
de vous sortir de là.
On est deux.
Qui dit qu'on ne tirera pas ?
Le fait que ce fusil
peut couper en deux
tout ce qu'il vise.
Et il est pointé sur vous.
Je suis désolé.
Où l'emmènes-tu ?
Là où il changera quelque chose.
- Comment va mon fils ?
- Très bien.
Le nouveau coeur fonctionne.
Votre fils vivra vieux.
Une chance
qu'on ait trouvé un donneur.
Qui que ce soit,
c'est un don du ciel.
En tout cas, c'était un héros.
Un anonyme donne un coeur
à un enfant mourant
Bravo, petit frère.
Bravo !

George Harper en 1980
Tu vas t'en tirer, Patrick.
Vous avez de la chance
que je ne vous tue pas.
Vos mains.
- Vous êtes qui ?
- George Harper.
Ne dites pas ça au chef
de son service de sécurité.
On recommence.
Qui êtes-vous ?
C'est bien Jarod.
Laboratoires Clarkston.
lls fabriquent un célèbre
antidépresseur, le Panalex.
Jarod y a travaillé
trois semaines.
- Qui a-t-il aidé ?
- Personne.
ll ne volait pas la formule
de mystérieuses vitamines.
Tenez-vous bien.
Un des principaux actionnaires
de Clarkston est...
M. Raines ?
On a tous besoin d'un pécule.
Continuez.
C'est une piste fiable.
Pas tant qu'on n'a pas trouvé
le but affectif de Jarod.
Le but de Jarod
est de persécuter le Centre.
ll en veut à mes actions.
Si c'était le cas,
vous seriez fauché.
Jarod agit par altruisme.
Vous voulez qu'il aide
Monsieur Tout-le-monde ?
La réponse est M. Tout-le-monde.
Pour trouver Jarod, il faut
trouver celui qu'il aide.
Je veux mon papa !
ll va s'en sortir ?
C'est trop tôt pour le dire.
Mais il restera
au moins 1 5 jours ici.
J'ai été un peu dur
avec vous, docteur...
Vous voulez retrouver Patrick
autant que son père.
Je comprends.
Le ravisseur vous a laissé
un téléphone portable.
- Désormais, je m'en occupe.
- M. Alamar,
c'est moi qu'il a vu.
En devenant George Harper,
j'ai obtenu un sursis à cet enfant.
Racontez-moi ce qui s'est passé.
M. Harper a reçu le mot
vers 1 5 h.
ll m'a donné rendez-vous
à la cabine téléphonique.
Chaque jour,
une limousine accompagne
et va chercher Patrick à l'école.
Aujourd'hui,
le chauffeur n'a trouvé que ça.
Vous lui avez parlé ?
ll a trouvé le sac
à l'endroit où Patrick attend.
ll travaille pour nous
depuis longtemps.
J'ai quand même fait
une enquête sur lui.
M. Harper est prêt
à payer ce salaud.
Mais je connais
leur raisonnement.
J'ai travaillé pour le FBl
sur des affaires d'enlèvement.
ll est très probable
qu'il tuera Patrick
pour ne pas être identifié.
C'est un professionnel.
ll veut qu'on se sente
complètement impuissants
afin de pouvoir réaliser
son fantasme de pouvoir.
Que savez-vous des ravisseurs,
docteur ?
Quand j'étais enfant,
on m'a enlevé à mes parents.
Je peux vous aider
à retrouver Patrick.
Mais il faut me faire confiance.
Sinon, d'ici demain,
Patrick sera mort.
Gardez le téléphone.
Pour le moment.
Une boîte à déjeuner !
Tu vas bientôt aller
dans une école spéciale.
C'estpour ça que les professeurs
sont venus hier ?
Oui, ils disent que tu es doué.
Je savais déjà
que tu étais malin.
Ca va te plaire, Jarod.
Je suis la maman
la plus fière du monde.
Je peux vous aider ?
Vous êtes enseignante ?
Je suis George Harper.
C'est un honneur.
Je m'appelle Judith Peck.
Heavenhurst doit beaucoup
à votre contribution.
Vous avez ouvert l'école
à des élèves défavorisés.
Désolée de sembler surprise
- de vous voir.
- Je comprends.
Je suis là au sujet de mon fils.
Voici Martin Benton, responsable
de la sécurité de l'école.
Je suis navrée.
Ca ne s'est jamais produit.
Je suis sous le choc.
Prévenez la police.
lmpossible. C'est une
des exigences du ravisseur.
Si je pouvais trouver
un indice...
ll était à l'étude
après les cours.
ll lisait, je crois.
Des exercices pour la dyslexie ?
- ll finit vers 1 5 h.
- Avec le reste du groupe.
Les autres élèves partent à 1 4 h.
ll ne veut pas
qu'on fasse de différence.
- ll déteste ça.
- ll veut être
comme les autres. C'est pour ça
qu'il lit des B.D. en cours.
C'est là qu'il attend
qu'on vienne le chercher.
On peut faire
quelque chose pour vous ?
Oui. Rien.
Ne contactez
ni la police ni la presse.
Je vous en supplie.
- La vie de Patrick en dépend.
- Bien sûr.
J'ai été volé.
On m'a enlevé en pleine nuit.
Tout me revient, Sydney.
Des souvenirs refoulés.
lls font souvent surface au cours
d'événements traumatiques.
Mais ces souvenirs
comptent moins
que la façon de les aborder.
Comment abordez-vous les vôtres ?
Vous arrivez à assumer
ce qu'on m'a fait ?
Rien ne peut justifier
ce qui t'est arrivé.
Mais ce que tu fais
à l'extérieur depuis 2 ans
me porte à croire
que quelque chose de bon...
Est sorti de quelque chose
de vraiment mal.
C'est comme un cauchemar.
Tout me revient par bribes.
D'abord, la peur.
Puis, la panique.
De quoi devenir fou.
Je redeviens un enfant.
ll fait noir
et je suis seul.
Je ne pense qu'à revoir
ma famille.
Je veux retrouver
mon univers d'avant.
Quand je pourrai voir mon papa ?
Harper paiera
et tu auras ta part.
Demain.
Oui, le gosse est en train
de prendre son dernier repas.
Vous êtes en retard.
Les laboratoires Clarkston...
Jarod était représentant
à Sunnyvale, en Californie.
Vous avez des preuves
sur un enlèvement d'enfant ?
Pourquoi en aurait-il ?
Un pressentiment.
Passez la bande, M. Broots.
On me force à faire ça, Sydney.
Vous arrivez à assumer
ce qu'on m'a fait ?
Rien ne peutjustifier
ce qui t'est arrivé.
Mais ce que tu fais à l'extérieur
depuis 2 ans me porte à croire
que quelque chose de bon...
Ca fait 2 ans que je dis que
vos liens personnels avec Jarod
entravent sa poursuite.
En voici la preuve.
Mes conversations avec Jarod
n'ont rien de nouveau.
Elles nous éloignent de lui.
Elles l'empêchent de disparaîître.
Sydney...
il a raison.
2 millions.
J'ai pris ce que j'ai pu
dans la chambre de Patrick.
Mais je ne vois pas
à quoi ça sert.
Si je dois être George Harper,
il faut que je comprenne sa vie
et celle de son fils.
Le ravisseur ne doit pas
savoir que je mens.
Le chauffeur de la limousine
est innocent.
J'ai fait des recherches
sur certains associés.
Rien.
Le FBl ne connaîît aucun ravisseur
opérant ainsi.
Du moins,
pour ces 5 dernières années.
Espérons que ce salaud tienne
parole et nous rende Patrick.
C'est la mère de Patrick ?
Chloe. Une femme formidable.
Décédée en 96.
Patrick adore les puzzles.
Ca l'aide à réfléchir.
C'est ce qu'il dit toujours.
C'est moi qui lui ai offert
celui-ci.
Quand M. Harper rentre tard,
j'aide Patrick.
Si on veut !
ll est plus rapide que moi.
Ca va ?
Dans les enlèvements
que j'ai suivis...
ce que certains types
font aux gosses, c'est...
On le retrouvera.
Patrick...
ll reprend connaissance.
M. Harper, je m'appelle Jarod.
ll va nous aider, M. Harper.
Patrick est là ?
ll n'est pas là.
Mais tout va bien se passer.
Je vous le promets.
On nous envoie à Sunnyvale.
Broots a trouvé ça.
Jarod est là-dessous.
On part dans une heure.
Raines nous impose willie.
Mais il ignore
que Sam est déjà en route.
Je serai prêt.
Je m'en veux
d'avoir soutenu Raines,
mais le monstre n'a pas tort.
Le cordon affectif
qui vous lie à Jarod
devient un problème.
A vos yeux.
Jarod fait votre boulot, hein ?
Je pourrais en dire
autant de vous.
Ses énigmes ne marchent plus
avec moi.
Ce n'est pas votre cas.
Comme vous l'avez dit,
on nous envoie à Sunnyvale.
Le ravisseur a appelé ?
Où est mon fils ?
ll sera là d'ici ce soir.
Quand il est né,
j'allais le voir la nuit
dans sa chambre.
Je me penchais sur lui,
habituant mes yeux à l'obscurité.
Quand je le voyais respirer,
je savais qu'il allait bien.
Les jeunes parents sont anxieux.
Jeunes ? Je vais voir Patrick
tous les soirs.
A quoi ça a servi ?
J'aurais dû être là.
Si vous aviez été là, c'est vous
qui auriez trouvé le sac à dos.
C'est tout.
Depuis la mort de Chloe,
je suis seul avec Patrick.
Je l'ai perdue
dans une chambre semblable.
Je lui ai promis qu'on formerait
une famille soudée.
Je le retrouverai.
Je peux vous aider ?
Désolé. J'essayais de me mettre
à la place de Patrick.
Vous êtes au bon endroit.
C'est là qu'il lit ses B.D.
Vous devez être perdu.
Le ravisseur appellera
dans moins de 2 h.
Je suis allé voir Harper.
Vous n'étiez pas là.
- Que faites-vous ici ?
- Je vous suis.
- Vous devriez être à l'hôpital.
- ll reste 2 h.
- ll y a encore du temps.
- Pour quoi ?
Pour ça.
ll achetait des B.D. ici.
C'est là que
le ravisseur l'a enlevé.
ll a vidé le sac à dos,
glissé le mot dedans
et l'a laissé
pour que le chauffeur le trouve.
Et personne n'a rien vu.
Presque personne.
Voilà à quoi
marchent les médecins.
Au sucre.
Pas de plaques !
La bande ne sert à rien.
ll portait une cagoule.
On est dans une impasse.
Compris.
Je veux voir Harper
avant de recevoir l'appel.
J'ai failli avaler votre histoire.
Mon bureau m'a appelé.
J'ai fait une enquête sur vous.
Votre trace est difficile
à suivre, Dr Pearce.
Peut-être parce que
vous êtes mort en 1 979.
Vous ne vous êtes pas
fait passer pour Harper,
vous avez conclu un accord
avec le ravisseur.
Combien il vous paie ?
Je sais que vous considérez
Patrick comme votre fils
et que vous avez vu des horreurs
en travaillant pour le FBl.
Vous craignez
qu'il subisse la même chose.
Mais je vous jure
que je veux aider ce gosse.
Et pour l'aider,
je dois répondre.
Faites-moi confiance.
George Harper.
Même cabine dans 1 0 minutes.
1 0 minutes.
Mlle Parker, je le tiens.
Le ravisseur observe sûrement.
Descendez ici.
Je surveille les lieux.
Tentez quoi que ce soit
et je vous tue.
Je n'en attends pas moins.
Je suis là !
Mettez l'argent dans la poubelle
d'en face.
- Quand verrai-je Patrick ?
- Quandj'aurai l'argent.
Comment me fier à vous ?
Où est mon fils ?
Harper,
j'avais dit pas de flics.
Qu'est-ce que vous racontez ?
Notre accord ne tient plus.
Le petit est mort.
Vous êtes un homme d'affaires.
Votre prix sera le mien.
2 millions de plus dans 3 h.
Si je vois un insigne de flic,
votre fils cesse de respirer.
Je veux lui parler.
Je veux savoir qu'il est en vie.
Je t'aime, papa.
Votre fils est intelligent,
M. Harper.
Pas besoin
de cours de rattrapage !
Gardez le téléphone.
J'appellerai.
- C'était qui ?
- Sûrement un des ravisseurs.
ll veut 2 millions de plus
dans 3 h.
ll faut les trouver.
Vous savez à qui vous fier.
On peut faire confiance
à ce type ?
Comment le savoir ?
ll nous reste 2 h.
Des algorithmes exponentiels.
J'essayais de les résoudre
quand j'étais enfant.
Ca me permettait de m'évader.
Comme les puzzles pour Patrick.
Je n'avais jamais vu ça
sous cet angle.
On va le retrouver.
ll savait.
ll me l'a dit
juste avant de raccrocher.
ll savait que Patrick
était dans une classe spéciale.
ll savait qu'il resterait
après l'école.
Mais comment savait-il
qu'il serait seul ?
Quelqu'un a dû voir Jarod
dans ce satané hôpital !
- Du nouveau ?
- Gagné !
- Vous avez vu cet homme ?
- Jarod ?
Bien sûr. Un instant.
lci le Dr Hargadon.
Je cherche
à joindre le poste 7477.
C'est urgent.
Vous connaissez Jarod ?
- Vous êtes une amie à lui ?
- Une vieille amie.
ll est en haut. J'y vais.
Suivez-moi.
Le remplaçant de Jarod
est arrivé.
Mais il a encore un patient.
ll a dû le faire transférer.
C'est louche.
Connaissant Jarod,
il doit être sous mon nez.
Vous avez raté votre coup.
Sam, fouillez partout.
On se retrouve en bas.
Broots, Sydney, suivez-moi.
Vous avez reçu mon message.
Merci de m'aider
à garder mon travail secret.
C'est vous qui avez fait
avouer le Dr Mitchell ?
Désolé d'avoir dû vous mentir.
Je savais que les labos
m'enverraient leurs avocats.
Des avocats ! Ca explique
l'arrogance de cette femme.
On reste.
Etudiez les dossiers du personnel.
Voyez où était viré
le salaire de Jarod.
Mais son dernier patient
a été transféré.
Trop simple. Le petit génie
me fait toujours un pied de nez.
Vous attendez quoi ?
ll est toujours dans les parages.
Je le sens.
''Cher parents,
pour faciliter la circulation
''en dépit des travaux
à proximité de l'école,
''les enfants ne sortiront pas
par le côté sud
''mais au nord de l'école
le mardi 1 7.
''Meilleurs sentiments,
''Martin Benton.''
Prenez donc la camionnette.
Sortez-moi de là.
Du calme.
Vous avez été enlevé,
comme mon fils.
- Harper ?
- Combien il vous paie ?
Combien vaut la vie de mon fils ?
Sortez-moi de là,
je vous en prie.
ll est trop tôt pour supplier.
Les victimes d'enlèvement
mettent quelques minutes
avant de laisser place
au désespoir.
D'abord, ils doivent affronter
une peur accablante.
Comme mon fils,
vous vous demandez :
''ll va me tuer
ou simplement me torturer ?''
Lâchez-moi !
Vous suppliez encore.
Vous avez transféré la sortie
des élèves du côté nord.
En veillant à ce que Patrick
ne le sache pas.
ll était seul.
Vous avez supervisé
l'enlèvement, hein ?
Je ne comprends pas.
J'ai une vidéo de l'endroit
où mon fils achète ses B.D.
Maintenant, dites-moi
combien il vous paie.
1 00 000.
Où est Patrick ?
ll me tuera.
Pas si je m'en charge.
Où est-il ?
Argent ou pas,
il tuera Patrick.
Où ça vous mène ?
Où est-il ?
Dans un hangar désaffecté.
En face de la cabine téléphonique.
ll m'observait.
ll nous reste moins de 30 mn.
Je sais où est Patrick.
- Où êtes-vous ?
- A votre place.
- Quelqu'un me cherche ?
- Non.
On se retrouve là-bas.
Dépêchez-vous !
Un petit garçon
a été enlevé.
ll a besoin de moi.
Ca ne marche plus.
- lls vont le tuer.
- La police interviendra.
- La police ne sait rien.
- Emmenez-le.
Sydney, je vous en prie,
ne laissez pas faire ça !
On m'a enlevé de la même faCon.
Je veux voir ma maman.
Relâchez-moi !
C'est fini.
Comment assumez-vous
votre passé ?
Mlle Parker.
- Je m'occupe de tout.
- Ben voyons !
Arrangez-vous avec M. Raines.
Reculez.
Non, willie !
Je suis touché !
- Jarod, arrête !
- Parker !
Le numéro du téléphone portable
que vous avez composé
n'estpas...
Je vais tuer votre fils.
Sous vos yeux.
Vous tiendrez le coup,
M. Harper ?
Je ne suis pas M. Harper.
Je suis fière de toi.
Je suis la maman
la plus fière du monde.
C'est terminé, Patrick.
- Papa !
- Patrick !
Laisse-moi te regarder.
- Comment ça va ?
- Bien.
lnacceptable.
Jarod s'est échappé
à cause de vous, Mlle Parker.
Pas du tout.
Parker a attrapé Jarod.
willie a tout saboté.
C'est ce que dira mon rapport.
A votre avis, comment
réagira mon père en le lisant ?
Ce n'est pas terminé.
Vous pouvez parier
votre calvitie.
Je sais me défendre toute seule.
Je savais
que vous feriez le bon choix.
Vous savez...
Sydney,
parfois je me demande
si vous voulez qu'il aide
M. Tout-le-monde à l'extérieur.
Je veux qu'il revienne
autant que vous.
Mais je ne veux pas sa mort.
Capture
du ravisseur et son complice
Les gens qui vous cherchaient
vous trouvent très précieux.
En ce qui me concerne,
vous êtes mort en 1 979.
Tu cherches ça ?
La pièce qu'il me fallait !
C'est parfait.
Un jour,
vous ferez un excellent père.

Je veux savoir qui était
dans le bus avec Jarod.
La compagnie refuse
de me le dire.
La compagnie refuse...
Vous faites pitié.
lls ont des règles,
un certain protocole à suivre.
Tu m'invites à entrer ?
Bien sûr.
Entre.
Tu as bien arrangé cet endroit.
Ta mère aurait aimé.
Très intéressant !
Nouveau ?
C'est un cadeau
de fin d'études... de toi.
Tu t'en souviens.
Tu avais dix ans.
Tu avais fait un concert de piano.
Qu'avais-tu joué ?
La Lettre à Elise.
Le Menuet en sol de Bach.
Elle était belle.
Comme toi.
J'aimerais qu'on s'en souvienne
telle qu'elle était.
On a dit tant de mensonges.
Ceux que Jarod raconte
sur elle, sur moi...
La vérité sur maman
est dans mon coeur, à jamais.
Pourquoi es-tu venu ?
Un cauchemar.
lmpossible de dormir.
Je voulais m'assurer
que tu allais bien.
Le Menuet en sol de Bach.
J'aimerais te l'entendre jouer.
C'était vraiment son père ?
Que M. Parker retourne
là-bas après tant d'années...
c'est surprenant.
On travaille dur, je vois.
Vous avez reçu ça.
Votre père est venu vous voir ?
- Vous voulez en parler ?
- J'en ai l'air ?
lntéressant :
aujourd'hui à 1 1 h...
Les clés de ton passé.
Une lettre de votre mère ?
20 mars 1970.
Je compte lesjours
jusqu'à notre voyage en Europe.
J'ai hâte de te faire
découvrir le monde.
Mon ami et moi devons amender
une partie de la laideur
qui nous entoure.
Maisje te promets
que tout cela
sera oublié le 14 avril.
Ta maman qui t'aime.
Le 1 4 avril...
Le lendemain de sa mort.
Mettez pas tous vos oeufs
dans le même panier.
Des titres de rente ?
Un compte d'épargne ?
Bas les pattes.
J'attends un colis ou une lettre.
Au nom de Parker.
Maman m'envoie pour la pension.
Je dois attendre
que tu paies.
Adressez-vous à un guichet.
Des titres de rente ?
Je suppose que non.
J'ai des clients avant vous.
Veuillez faire la queue.
La patience n'est pas ton fort,
n'est-ce pas, Parker ?
Tu es gonflé de venir ici.
Tu ne sortirais pas une arme
dans une banque.
Où as-tu trouvé la lettre ?
Là où on s'y attendait pas.
Ca te dirait d'en lire plus ?
Enfoiré.
Tu pouvais me les envoyer.
Pourquoi me faire venir ?
Pour que tu ne rates pas
cet homme.
Bonjour, M. Fenigor.
ll faut faire sortir
Jarod et Timmy ce soir.
Celui qui aidait ma mère
à sauver les enfants ?
ll l'a aidée à tenter de me sauver.
C'est un habitué.
ll vient chaque vendredi
depuis des années.
Mon ami et moi devons amender
une partie de la laideur
qui nous entoure.
ll sait qui a tué ma mère ?
Et qui sont mes parents.
Les clés de notre passé.
Bougez pas !
C'est un hold-up !
Vous bougez, vous êtes morts !
On m'a enlevé à ma famille.
Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà
plus doué que les autres.
Combien de gens sont morts
à cause de moi ?
Depuis mon évasion,
je cherche mon passé.
C'est un Caméléon.
Un génie qui peut devenir
qui il veut.
- Le Centre le veut vivant.
- De préférence.
ll défend les opprimés.
La vie est un don.
Vous êtes médecin ?
Aujourd'hui, oui.
Si je trouve un colis piégé,
j'en tue un au hasard.
- Tu fais quoi ?
- Je règle ça.
En nous faisant tous tuer ?
Dès qu'ils s'en vont,
on interroge Fenigor.
Pas un mot,
pas un geste, pas de bobo !
Je veux voir vos mains.
Frank K. lsaac,
directeur adjoint.
J'ai une famille.
Je n'en doute pas.
Lâche ton arme
et tourne-toi.
Vous ne sortirez pas d'ici.
Alors, on a un problème.
Cleave !
La ferme.
Quand j'aurai compté jusqu'à 3,
posez votre flingue par terre.
Reculez.
Maintenant !
Tu regardes quoi ?
Surveille l'entrée.
A terre.
Maintenant !
Un commentaire ?
Rien de flatteur.
Tant mieux.
Tout le monde par ici !
ll est encore temps...
Pas pour lui.
Fermez-la et bougez-vous.
Lieutenant Row. Déployez le GlGN
dans le périmètre de la banque.
Tireurs d'élite sur place
dans 3 mn.
Dégagez l'accès à la banque.
Ecartez les curieux.
Par ici.
Derrière le bureau du directeur.
En vitesse !
Baissez-vous !
Vous bougez, vous êtes mort.
Donnez-moi
tous vos objets précieux.
Votre portefeuille.
Vite !
On dirait qu'il a vu un fantôme.
Et je compte le visiter
dès que possible.
Cet homme est en vie
et j'en savais rien !
ll faut croire
que ton père t'a pas tout dit.
ll t'a parlé des lettres ?
ll ignorait leur existence.
Ca m'étonnerait, vu que
je les ai volées dans son coffre.
- Je l'ai réveillé.
- Quand ?
Cette nuit.
Pourquoi es-tu venu ?
Un cauchemar.
lmpossible de dormir.
Quand on a tant à perdre,
on devrait mieux se protéger.
Tu mens.
Parle-lui du cadeau
que je lui ai laissé.
Vous êtes sûr que c'était Jarod ?
ll a pris des affaires à Catherine
et à moi et il a laissé ça.
Jarod se paie notre tête.
A qui c'est ?
lci Broots.
Vous m'entendez ?
Vous auriez tué
mon petit frère ?
Le meurtrier, c'est vous.
Couvre-le.
Loin des yeux, loin du coeur !
Laissez-la.
Debout !
- Tu fais quoi ?
- Je nous sors de là.
2 bandits armés
ontpris Dover Town Bank.
On sait qu'ils ont tiré
etpris des otages.
Elle n'a pas raccroché.
J'ai pu localiser le signal.
La police de Dover
m'a parlé du hold-up.
J'ai appelé M. Parker,
mais personne n'a répondu.
Allons à Dover.
Sans ordre d'en haut ?
Laissez tomber.
Parker est plus qu'une collègue.
C'est une amie.
ll y a un problème.
L'un des suspects
sort de la banque
en tenant un otage.
C'est qui je pense ?
Je veux un hélico pour aller
à l'aéroport et un avion là-bas.
Bon sang !
Occupez-vous-en
ou des gens vont mourir.
Où est-ce ?
A Dover.
Dover Town Bank ?
Rassemblez vos hommes.
13 avril, 14 h.
Le sauvetage de Timmy a échoué.
Raines a déjà détruit
cet enfant.
Qu'allez-vous faire de Timmy ?
ll n'y a plus de Timmy.
Désormais, c'estAngelo.
On sauvera Jarod ce soir
et demain, nous partirons
vers un monde meilleur.
Ta maman qui t'aime.
Vous partez ?
Visiblement, non.
C'est non-fumeur.
Appelez les flics.
La clé de la chambre forte.
Papa, donne-lui.
''Papa'' ?
C'est votre fille ?
Laissez-la !
D'accord, papa.
Mais elle est mignonne.
C'est à cause de ta mère
que tu es ici.
C'est parce que tu m'aimes pas.
Elle t'a dit ça ?
Que je ne t'aime pas ?
Elle ment.
Des mensonges.
Ceux que Jarod raconte
sur elle, sur moi.
Les parents qui mentent...
Ca me rappelle quelque chose.
Mon père avait ses raisons
de me cacher ces lettres.
Comme de dire
que ta mère s'était suicidée ?
Si tu y crois, pourquoi tiens-tu
tant à interroger M. Fenigor ?
- Le code du coffre fort.
- Seul le directeur le connaîît.
Ca va, ma douce ?
On s'attaque pas
à plus petit que soi.
Vous voulez
une balle dans la tête ?
Je peux ouvrir le coffre.
- M. Bricolage ?
- Je suis touche-à-tout.
ll y a une autre façon de sortir.
Moins sanglante,
surtout pour vous.
- Quoi ?
- ll y a un conduit
qui mène aux égouts.
Par ici.
Comment vous le savez ?
J'ai étudié les plans
avant de venir.
Moi aussi, je suis en cavale.
Vous êtes M. Bricolage
et architecte en cavale.
Touche-à-tout, en effet !
Ouvrez-le.
Parfait !
Demande à manger.
J'ai faim.
T'as toujours faim.
Là-dedans.
Donne-moi un sac, vite.
Surveille l'extérieur.
M. Fenigor, je m'appelle Jarod.
Vous vous souvenez de moi ?
Je devrais ?
J'étais l'un des enfants
que vous avez voulu
sauver du Centre.
Vous avez voulu m'aider.
Je vous en prie,
aidez-moi maintenant.
De quoi parlez-vous ?
Vous seul pouvez me renseigner
sur mes parents.
Je sais qu'ils vous tiennent
et que vous avez peur.
J'ai vécu toute ma vie ainsi.
Aidez-moi.
Vous êtes avec elle ?
C'est compliqué.
- Vous m'en demandez beaucoup.
- Je vous demande
d'honorer le souvenir
de Catherine Parker.
Dites-moi
qui sont mes parents,
qui je suis.
Je ne peux pas.
Je ne peux vraiment pas.
- Je dois l'aider.
- C'est pas prévu.
Pas maintenant.
ll y a un pas
entre tirer sur un vigile armé
et tuer un innocent.
S'il meurt, vous aussi.
Sur la chaise électrique.
Le poumon est touché.
De l'air sort de la plaie.
- Des serviettes et du savon.
- Aux w.-c.
On manque de détails,
mais on a entendu tirer
à l'intérieur de la banque.
Je vais interroger
le commandant du GlGN.
Ne mourez pas !
Un sac plastique et du scotch.
J'ai un sac.
Je dois fermer la plaie
pour qu'il respire.
Coupez des bandes
de cette longueur.
Pressez la plaie.
- ll doit aller à l'hôpital.
- Pas question.
C'est juste un homme.
Pas question !
ll faut lui surélever les jambes.
ll est diaphorétique
et il a une hémorragie interne.
ll faut l'opérer.
Qu'est-ce que je fais là ?
- Ca fait quoi, d'être la proie ?
- Tu n'en serais plus une
si tu retournais au Centre.
Charmant !
Parfait !
Tu tiens à gâcher ma vie.
L'avis de ton père compte tant ?
Je suis avec Kristi lsaac,
dont la fille est retenue en otage.
Ne faites pas de mal à ma fille.
Elle est toutpour moi !
Kaylee, je t'aime.
Frank, veille sur elle.
- C'est dur de juger son père.
- Développe.
Tu es loyale envers un homme
qui te ment.
- Sur les lettres, sur Fenigor...
- Je dois être loyale envers toi ?
Si Fenigor te dit
que ton père a tué ta mère ?
C'est faux, il l'aimait !
Tu en es bien sûre ?
La police semble se préparer
à donner l'assaut.
A la chambre forte !
Comment va-t-il ?
ll est stable, pour l'instant.
Vous le connaissez bien ?
ll vient chaque vendredi
retirer de l'argent.
Jamais de dépôts ?
Son compte est approvisionné
de l'extérieur.
Une société de Blue Cove.
Le Centre achète
le silence de Fenigor.
Mais qui ?
Et le silence sur quoi ?
Par ici, Broots.
Rien ?
La police, des gens du coin.
Pas de tête connue.
On est peut-être seuls
à savoir Jarod ici.
Détrompez-vous.
Voilà Gar,
un homme de Raines.
C'est pas fini.
Voilà Sam.
- Ca grouille de nettoyeurs.
- Tachons de savoir
ce que mijote Raines.
Je suis Sam.
Suivez les autres.
Qu'est-ce que je fais là ?
Je dois avoir perdu la tête.
Que font-ils ?
lls étudient le plan de sortie ''B''.
13 avril, 19 h.
Je me méfie
des gens qui m'entourent.
Sije réussis ce soir,
nous partirons
vers un monde meilleur.
Ta maman qui t'aime.
Je sais, c'est dur
de lire ces lettres.
Je suis entré chez ton père
pour trouver un indice
sur mon passé.
Et j'en ai trouvé un sur le tien.
Ta mère méritait
un sort meilleur.
En effet !
Elle m'écrivait pour
mon anniversaire, pour les fêtes.
Je ne savais rien
de ces lettres.
Mon père est venu me voir
ce matin.
ll m'a parlé de la façon
dont tu mens sur son passé.
Tu l'as cru ?
Papa ?
Je dois aller aux w.-c.
- Retiens-toi.
- Je peux pas.
Ces dingues risqueraient
de nous tuer.
- Que faites-vous ?
- Votre boulot.
- On doit aller aux w.-c.
- Retenez-vous.
Soyez sympa !
Merci pour tout à l'heure.
Quand faut y aller,
faut y aller.
Mon père dit
qu'il veut s'occuper de moi...
mais il me ment !
Pourquoi es-tu venu ?
Un cauchemar.
lmpossible de dormir.
Je dois croire quoi ?
Ce que ton coeur te dit.
Vous avez reçu une balle.
Ne bougez pas.
Vous m'avez sauvé la vie.
J'ai fait ce qu'il fallait.
Je regrette...
de vous avoir enlevé
à vos parents.
Je veux que vous sachiez
à quel point je regrette.
M. Fenigor,
qui sont mes parents ?
C'est la clé de son coffre ?
- S'il y a des choses sur ma mère ?
- Tu les auras.
Je ne te laisse pas tomber.
Ma mère vous considérait
comme son ami. Vous lui devez,
et vous me devez la vérité.
Qui l'a tuée ?
Qui l'a tuée ?
ll respire à peine.
Qui achète votre silence ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
- Du sang dans les poumons.
ll faut l'intuber.
J'ai une gourde
sur le bureau de papa.
Le vieux s'étouffe.
ll y a une gourde
sur le bureau du directeur.
ll mourra si on l'aide pas.
Pour le vigile, vous n'avez
rien pu faire, mais là, si.
Accrochez-vous.
Reculez.
Pas un geste !
- Arrière ou je tue petit frère.
- J'ai descendu
2 hommes, alors un de plus...
Ne tuez pas mon père !
Alors ?
L'homme de Raines
a la tenue du GlGN.
ll doit viser Jarod.
ll faut s'en occuper
avant qu'il le tue.
Me regardez pas.
Je ferais pas de mal à une mouche.
Surveillez le passage.
Que personne ne me suive.
Vous êtes d'attaque ?
Non, mais Ca ne m'a jamais arrêté.
Sydney, M. Raines veut vous voir.
Ce sera inutile.
Qu'est-ce que tu faisais là ?
Le vieux avait besoin d'aide.
D'aide ?
Moi, j'ai besoin d'aide.
Recommence,
tu finiras comme le vigile.
Frère ou pas.
- Ca va ?
- Je veux rentrer chez moi.
- Moi aussi.
- Ne l'approche pas.
- Elle voulait nous sauver.
- En risquant de nous tuer.
- Ca va.
- Non.
Obéis.
- Je suis ton père.
- Depuis quand ?
Tu peux garder ton fric.
Dire que maman pensait
que je changerais les choses !
Tout ça, c'est votre faute.
Vous êtes ignare
ou simplement bête ?
- Ecoutez-moi.
- A vous de m'écouter !
Vous croyez
qu'elle venait pour l'argent ?
ll y a une chose
plus importante que le fric.
Et j'ai de la peine pour vous
si vous êtes trop aveugle
pour voir quoi !
Mlle Parker a voulu
aider quelqu'un !
- Arrête.
- Ta mère serait fière de toi.
Belle performance !
Sydney t'a bien dressé.
ll m'a appris qu'on peut être
qui on veut.
Vous avez eu tort
de venir sans ordre.
Vous avez tort de défier
la politique de la Tour
en faisant assassiner Jarod.
Vous êtes complètement perdu.
Tuez-le s'il tente de fuir.
J'ai commis des erreurs.
Je ne veux pas te perdre.
Vous étiez l'ami de ma mère,
son confident.
Dites-moi qui l'a tuée.
ll me dira rien.
ll l'a peut-être déjà fait.
Vous feriez ça ?
Vous me tuerez si je sors ?
Avancez, vieux.
Merci infiniment, Gar.
Faites ce que l'agent a dit :
avancez.
Les versements de Fenigor.
Un virement du Centre.
1 0 000 dollars par mois.
Chaque mois depuis 28 ans.
Tu reconnais le nl de compte ?
- C'est celui de ton père.
- Qu'en sais-tu ?
J'en sais beaucoup sur lui.
- C'est tout ?
- C'est tout.
Que sait-il d'autre ?
Apparemment, tout.
Quels secrets
contient cette enveloppe ?
C'est à propos
de Prodige.
C'est de là que vous venez.
Sortez-moi de là
et je vous dirai tout.
A tous les deux.
Tu comptes en faire quoi ?
Le type avait raison.
ll y a un accès aux égouts.
On va se tirer d'ici.
C'est votre jour de chance.
Grâce au plan génial de Jarod,
aucun de vous ne mourra.
Malgré tout...
c'était vachement sympa.
On mourra pas de faim.
Donnez-moi ça.
- Quoi ?
- Donnez.
Allez, Jude.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Faut évacuer le vieux.
Attention !
Vite !
Je peux participer ?
Je suis claustrophobe.
C'est à moi.
Merci, Jarod.
Sortons d'ici.
La crise estpassée.
Les otages sortent de la banque
et les secours arrivent.
Pourquoi mon père vous paie ?
C'est lié à ma mère ?
Répondez-moi !
Dans les dossiers rouges.
Les dossiers Prodige.
Le tireur est au 2e étage
de l'immeuble face à la banque.
Vous aviez raison.
Fenigor était là-bas.
- On l'a eu ?
- Blessé.
ll est dans l'ambulance.
Je m'en charge.
ll a pu lui parler ?
On pourra toujours nier.
Ca va ?
lmpeccable.
- Où est Jarod ?
- ll s'est enfui.
Encore raté.
Je vais bien, papa.
Tu dormiras mieux ce soir.
20 mars 1970.
Je compte lesjours
jusqu'à notre voyage en Europe.
J'ai hâte de te faire
découvrir le monde.
Mon ami et moi devons amender
une partie de la laideur
qui nous entoure.
Maisje te promets
que tout cela
sera oublié le 14 avril.
Ta maman qui t'aime.
Je peux toujours entrer ?
ll est tard.
Dieu merci, tu vas bien.
Je suis désolé
de ne pas l'avoir dit avant.
Tu as fait tout ce chemin
pour ça ?
ll le fallait, mon ange.
Je n'ai pas été tout à fait franc
avec toi ce matin.
Quelqu'un s'est introduit chez moi
hier soir.
C'est affreux.
Tu n'as rien perdu de valeur ?
Rien qu'on ne peut remplacer.
Si j'avais su, j'aurais demandé
à Jarod si c'était lui.
Je voulais te le dire.
En famille, on ne doit pas
avoir de secrets,
n'est-ce pas ?
Pourquoi le Centre
a tiré sur ce vieil homme ?
Un tragique accident.
Tu sais qui c'était ?
Aucune idée.
Repose-toi, mon ange.
Tu l'as bien mérité.
Je ne t'ai pas dit au revoir.
Comment tu t'es enfui ?
Le plan de sortie ''B''.
Tu te souviens ?
Le conduit.
C'était bien, là-dessous ?
Je ne jouerai pas les égoutiers
de sitôt.
Tu as parlé à ton père ?
ll vient de partir. Sans dire
que c'était toi, le cambrioleur.
Ni le contraire.
Fenigor ?
J'ai prétendu
ne pas le connaîître.
Tu as menti.
Tel père, telle fille.
On était si près de la vérité.
Tu la découvriras.
Moi aussi.
Reste à savoir
ce qu'on deviendra
quand on aura nos réponses.
Là est la question.
C'est de là que vous venez.

Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Ca ressemble à un de ces lits

M. Fenigor,
dites-moi qui a tué ma mère.
La réponse
est dans les dossiers rouges.
Les dossiers Prodige.

Prodige...

Groupe familial Nugenesis
Construisons l'avenir
Prodige
Le garçon
J'ai envie de vendre,
mais j'avoue que c'est lugubre.
Parlez-moi de l'incendie.
Une famille vivait ici. La mère,
le père et leur jeune fils.
Cette histoire
est une vraie tragédie.
On dit que le garçon a été volé
et que les parents ont disparu
la nuit où la maison a brûlé.
- lls sont allés où ?
- lls étaient
locataires.
Ca a été revendu
juste après l'incendie.
Le propriétaire est une firme
de Blue Cove, Delaware.
Je dois aller travailler.
Je veux bien les appeler
si vous voulez
faire une offre.
Non, merci.
Le travail m'attend, moi aussi.
Harvard, Johns, Hopkins...
Médicalement, vous méritez
d'être chef de l'insémination.
Du point de vue des affaires ?
Un médecin du nom de Spock,
ça vaut cher.
Ravi d'intégrer
la famille Nugenesis.
Nous sommes dévoués
à la famille.
Construire l'avenir,
c'est notre mission.
Dr Haring, vous avez un instant ?
On m'a enlevé à ma famille.
Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà
plus doué que les autres.
Combien de gens sont morts
à cause de moi ?
Depuis mon évasion,
je cherche mon passé.
C'est un Caméléon.
Un génie qui peut devenir
qui il veut.
- Le Centre le veut vivant.
- De préférence.
ll défend les opprimés.
La vie est un don.
Vous êtes médecin ?
Aujourd'hui, oui.
M. Fenigor ?
Je ne mange pas,
je ne dors pas.
Dites-moi qui a tué ma mère.
Qu'est-ce que Prodige ?
Quelles réponses contiennent
les dossiers rouges ?
S'il vous plaîît, aidez-moi.
Mlle Parker,
vous n'êtes pas censée
être ici. Personne ne l'est.
ll a parlé ?
Pas depuis
qu'on l'a amené. On dit
qu'il ne parlera plus jamais.
On a essayé la fécondation
in vitro. Zéro.
Zéro.
On a fait le tour du monde.
Nugenesis s'avère
la seule clinique de fertilité
sérieuse.
Nous y tenons.
On est fiers d'être à la pointe
des techniques de reproduction.
Et j'ajouterai
que Jarod est à la pointe
de tous.
- Vous pouvez nous aider ?
- Quand on a tant d'amour
que vous deux à offrir,
on mérite d'avoir un enfant.
Le Dr Dewitt secondera Jarod.
lls sont ici pour vous.
Le moral du patient
est parfois plus important
que sa condition physique.
Si l'esprit a la foi,
le corps suivra.
A vous de vous assurer
que nos patients gardent la foi
pour que la science
puisse oeuvrer.
Analysez ceci
et donnez les résultats
au Dr Spock. Vite.
Spock ? Très drôle !
Depuis plus de 30 ans, on aide
les couples comme les Brewster.
30 ans ?
Vous n'étiez pas encore née.
ll me plaîît.
ll aurait plu aussi
à mon frère Boris.
- Mon père.
- Et comme il disait :
''Au travail.''
Je dois y aller.
Je vous retrouve plus tard.
C'est de là que vous venez.
Fenigor a parlé ?
ll est dans le coma.
Besoin de changer de Pampers ?
M. Raines trame quelque chose
de louche.
Tout ce que trame
ce vampire cramoisi
est louche.
Non... ll emballe ses dossiers
pour partir.
Trouvez où... et aussi
ce que veut dire Prodige.
C'est facile.
C'est un enfant très doué.
Je connais le sens du dictionnaire.
Je veux savoir
quel sens ça a pour le Centre.
Avec Sydney, renseignez-vous
sur Prodige
et sur les dossiers rouges.
Je ferai mon possible,
mais Sydney est occupé.
A quoi faire ?
Vous faites une soupe
à la matière grise ?
J'expérimente une thérapie
neuro-stimulante
dont j'espère qu'elle démêlera
l'esprit d'Angelo.
Bonne chance avec le lobotomisé.
Reprenons, Angelo.
Que faites-vous ?
Un nouveau bilan sanguin
pour les Brewster.
Vous n'avez pas le droit d'entrer.
Jeremy est un pitbull
du protocole.
Même moi, je n'entre pas.
Ordres de l'oncle Nicholas.
La stérilité est un sujet délicat,
personnel. Une des raisons
du succès de Nugenesis,
c'est la confiance.
Et la discrétion.
On n'utilise pas de noms,
seulement des chiffres codés.
Jeremy vous renseignera.
Plus que quatre injections,
mon ami.
Pourvu que ça marche.
ll faut un passe pour aller là.
- Un passe ?
- C'est le couloir 7.
L'accès est interdit.
Beaucoup d'endroits
me sont interdits, ici.
Veillez à ce que ces cartons
aient quitté mon bureau ce soir.
A tout à l'heure.
Je m'appelle Sydney.
Je vais m'occuper de toi.
Pourquoi ?
Où sont mes parents ?
Voilà un pansement neuf.
Pourquoi ?
Où sont mes parents ?
Essaie de résoudre un problème.
S'il chante Pygmalion,
je m'évanouis.
Angelo a retrouvé son esprit.
On restaure les synapses
de sa mémoire.
Vous connaissez
l'isotope de sérotonine ?
Ca semble régénérer
des synapses nécrosées.
Mais s'il n'a pas la dose entière,
il régressera définitivement.
Je suis impressionnée, Einstein.
Mais je me dis que Jarod
a un rapport avec ça.
Jarod se demande ce qu'on apprendra
si Angelo retrouve son esprit.
Le potentiel est illimité.
ll joue même du piano.
Musique.
Que se passe-t-il ?
La Chose s'est réveillée
et se prend pour Liberace.
ll a dû apprendre Ca petit.
Les données que son esprit
a absorbées toute sa vie
refont surface.
C'est la cerise
sur un drôle de gâteau.
De quoi parlez-vous ?
J'ai trouvé ça chez Raines.
ll en a 20 de plus sur son bureau.
Bureau sous lequel
je me suis caché plus d'une heure.
Le pire, c'est que j'ai vu Raines
faire... des choses intimes.
Quoi de si affreux ?
ll a changé de pantalon.
Merci bien !
Pourquoi Raines fait ses bagages ?
Et pourquoi le monstre
a 20 photos des mêmes écoliers ?
Les dossiers rouges.
ll peut pas recommencer !
- Pas encore !
- Angelo, calme-toi.
ll a dit ''dossiers rouges''.
S'il recouvre la mémoire,
il doit savoir des choses dessus.
Alors cet esprit dément
sait peut-être qui a tué ma mère.
Vous avez un message.
C'est de là que vous venez.
On dit que le garçon
a été volé...
Où sont mes parents ?
lls recommencent !
lls vont voler un autre enfant.
Le Centre va faire
un autre Caméléon.
Je croyais le programme Caméléon
abandonné.
Calme-toi, Jarod.
lls m'ont volé à mes parents
et ils vont voler un autre enfant.
Je ne sais pas,
mais les événements récents
me font croire que oui.
Qu'allez-vous faire, cette fois ?
Rester les bras croisés ?
Jarod, je t'en prie.
Je crois qu'Angelo
peut nous répondre.
- Le traitement marche ?
- Oui.
ll a vu une chose
qui a ravivé un mauvais souvenir.
Je sais ce qu'il ressent.
Le voilà !
Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
ll a besoin du traitement
à intervalles réguliers.
Viens, mon ami.
Réponses en bas.
C'est quoi, Prodige ?
Réponses en bas.
ll indique le sol.
Le niveau souterrain 27.
- ''Commencement''.
- Encore une table d'accouchement.
C'est une salle d'accouchement.
- lls reconstruisent cet endroit.
- Quoi ?
- Allons-nous-en.
- Réponses ici.
Trouvez les vidéos
de surveillance.
Tout ce qui concerne
cette salle.
Donnez-lui son traitement.
Voyez ce qu'il a dans la tête.
C'est peut-être lui,
ma piste au trésor.
Je m'appelle Sydney.
Je vais m'occuper de toi.
Pourquoi ?
Où sont mes parents ?
Si vous cherchez des données,
vous vous y prenez mal.
- Je peux vous aider.
- Pourquoi vous croirais-je ?
Votre mère m'a cru.
Je lave le sol depuis 30 ans
et j'ai vu
des tas de gens
aller et venir.
Le coeur sur la main,
pleins d'amour à donner
à un enfant.
Vos parents étaient comme ça.
Comment les avez-vous connus ?
lls sont restés 6 mois
en traitement.
Votre mère me traitait
avec respect.
Je l'ai revue un an plus tard.
Je n'oublierai jamais son regard
quand elle m'a montré son bébé.
Le même regard que vous.
- C'est le plus douloureux.
- Douloureux ?
Je les ai revus
quelques années après.
Elle avait peur, elle fuyait.
On lui avait volé son fils.
Vous, je crois.
Je les cherche.
Je suis en partie coupable.
J'ai répété ses dires au Dr Boris.
ll se passait d'étranges choses
au couloir 7, avec des enfants.
Des expériences...
Le Dr Boris a acheté mon silence.
Les expériences ont cessé.
Le Dr Boris est mort
et tout s'est arrêté.
- Jusqu'à ?
- Récemment, ça a repris.
Les enfants, les expériences.
Et vous voilà.
- Reconnaissez-vous ces enfants ?
- C'est une école d'ici.
Un de ces enfants va être enlevé,
comme je l'ai été.
Aidez-moi à empêcher Ca.
Je vous dois bien ça.
A vous et à votre mère.
ll n'y a plus de Timmy.
Désormais, il s'appelle Angelo.
Raines avait dit ça à ma mère
après la lobotomie.
ll s'en souvient trop vite.
Baissez la dose.
J'ai des questions à lui poser.
lmpossible.
Le traitement doit être donné
à intervalles réguliers.
A la moindre interruption,
ses synapses
- s'atrophient.
- Et alors ?
Angelo régressera
vers son moi antérieur.
Définitivement.
ll n'y a plus de Timmy.
Désormais, il sera connu
sous le nom d'Angelo.
Passez-moi M. Raines.
J'ai rangé les affaires
du Dr Boris ici.
Les dossiers rouges
ne peuvent être qu'ici.
Vous percez les coffres ?
Peut-être qu'aujourd'hui,
j'en aurai pas besoin.
ll y a quelque chose ?
Moi.
Et les dossiers rouges.
Qu'est-ce que ça dit sur vous ?
Groupe sanguin, taille, poids.
Strictement médical.
Sauf une chose.
La destination.
Elle est rayée.
Essaie de résoudre un problème.
Je suis venu ici.
'multiplié
par la racine carrée de 931,
divisé
par le rayon du cercle.
Très bien, Jarod.
Tu es très doué.
Où sont mes parents ?
Devinez ce que j'ai trouvé.
Les vidéos de surveillance
de la salle de Commencement.
Un enregistrement visuel
classé sous le nom
de Catherine Parker.
Du jour où vous êtes née.
Poussez encore.
Mlle Parker,
c'est votre naissance.
- C'est bizarre.
- Et c'est pas fini.
Ca vient, ça vient.
- C'est...
- Le Dr Raines.
Raines m'a fait naîître ?
ll vous tape les fesses.
Je vais vomir.
C'est une fille.
Dire qu'il m'a vue nue !
Catherine,
le second arrive en vitesse.
Le second ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
Apparemment,
vous n'étiez pas seule.
Un problème avec le garçon.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Dites-moi ce qu'il a !
ll n'y a plus rien ?
La bande s'arrête là,
ou on l'a coupée.
Ou effacée,
pour que personne n'apprenne
la vérité.
J'avais un frère.
J'ai trouvé le coffre du trésor,
mais dedans, que de la poussière.
Parfois, les réponses
posent d'autres questions.
Je me rappelle le prénom
de vos parents.
Margaret et Charles.
Mais ce n'étaient pas
vos parents biologiques.
- Comment ça ?
- A l'époque,
c'était aussi un centre d'adoption.
Le Dr Boris
dirigeait les adoptions.
Le Dr Nicholas, les conceptions.
Encore une impasse.
Pas sûr.
Oakview Lodge,
vers Stone Mountain.
Vos parents y logeaient
quand ils venaient ici.
Peut-être un trésor,
ou de la poussière.
Dites-moi quand ce sera fait.
Et pas d'excuses...
Mon ange !
ll y a une touche ''stop'' ?
Pardonne-moi ma fierté de père.
Tu es ravissante,
assise ici. Un jour,
ce sera ta place. Pour toujours.
Les parents veulent le meilleur
pour leurs enfants...
Comment oses-tu ?
Pourquoi ne m'as-tu pas dit
que j'avais un jumeau ?
Ta mère et moi...
nous voulions t'épargner
un chagrin inutile.
J'étais absent quand vous êtes nés.
ll est mort
avant d'avoir vécu.
On l'a enterré, lui.
Mais pas le chagrin.
Chagrin ou pas, j'ai le droit
de savoir que j'avais un frère.
- Mon ange...
- Non, papa.
Les parents se trompent, eux aussi.
ll est enterré sur une concession
du Centre, nl 66.
- Je t'y emmènerai.
- Non.
Je préfère y aller seule.
Un pas de plus
et je vous dégomme.
Dites-moi plutôt
que c'est complet.
Je suis désolé.
On a été pas mal cambriolés,
ces derniers temps.
Et vu l'heure,
je n'attendais pas de clients.
Vous êtes le gérant ?
Lewis King Rue.
Hôtelier des stars.
Vous avez le choix :
vue sur la montagne,
sur le lac.
Même une chambre
où a dormi Jeff Davies.
Vous avez grandi ici ?
J'ai vieilli, jamais grandi.
Vous reconnaissez cette femme ?
Vous devez être bébé Jarod.
Je n'oublierai jamais l'hiver
où j'ai connu vos parents.
Je vous ai parlé du lac.
Un jour, il avait gelé
et je suis allé dessus.
La glace s'est brisée
et votre père a accouru
pour me sauver la peau.
Quoi ?
Vous ne ressemblez pas
à vos parents.
lls dormaient dans cette maison.
Allons voir.
Voilà.
Un peu de lumière.
Ca n'a rien de fantastique,
mais votre père aimait la vue.
Le major Charles.
A cause de l'uniforme
de l'armée de l'air.
ll était pilote.
Tous deux s'installaient ici
pour regarder le lever du soleil.
lls s'aimaient beaucoup.
J'aimerais rester un peu.
Faites comme chez vous.
Vous êtes de la famille.
En trouvant Timmy, vous avez
libéré Angelo. Merci, Sydney.
Bonjour, les enfants.
Je m'appelle Jar...
Je m'appelle M. Kotter.
Je remplace Mlle Markam
pour la journée.
Tout d'abord, nous allons
faire de petits groupes.
On commence toujours
par le serment au drapeau.
J'ai entendu parler de ça.
A toi de commencer.
Je prête
serment au drapeau
des Etats-Unis d'Amérique...
C'est tout ?
Maintenant, formons des groupes.
Je vais vous désigner
votre bureau.
Bureau nl1 : Albert williams,
Ari Thompson
et Davy Simpkins.
Bureau nl2...
Tyrannosaurus Rex ? Très bien.
Essayez de résoudre
ce problème.
On peut découper des dinosaures ?
Soyez sages un instant.
Je reviens.
- Où est Angelo ?
- ll s'est échappé
du Centre.
''En trouvant Timmy,
vous avez libéré Angelo.
''Merci, Sydney.''
C'est magnifique...
Non ?
Vous êtes fier de vous, Syd ?
Génial !
Pendant qu'Algernon est dehors
à cueillir des fleurs
et que vous vous regardez
le nombril,
je me retrouve en plan.
Et attendez
que Raines apprenne ça.
- Angelo sait prendre le sérum ?
- J'espère.
ll lui reste trois injections.
S'il en manque une,
il redeviendra l'ancien Angelo.
Définitivement.
Et ce qu'il sait
sera perdu à jamais.
Merci, papa.
'multiplié par la racine carrée
de 931, divisé
par le rayon du cercle.
Qui a fait ça ?
C'est toi !
Sept dossiers rouges.
Des nettoyeurs les ont trouvés
dans la pièce d'Angelo.
On cherche encore.
Vous connaissez les conséquences,
en cas de fuite.
Je veux votre permission
d'accélérer Prodige,
pour nous assurer de son succès.
Allez chercher le nouveau.
Amenez-nous l'enfant.
J'ai fait le plus vite possible.
Content de te revoir.
Le vrai toi.
Content d'être moi.
Le monde est vaste.
Mes parents sont venus ici
il y a longtemps.
J'ai l'impression
de me chercher moi-même.
Est-ce que je connaîîtrai
un jour mes parents ?
Tu es aussi
dans les dossiers rouges.
ll y a des réponses, Angelo.
ll suffit de les trouver.
C'est Timmy, maintenant.
Quoi ?
J'ai appris
la mort de ton frère.
C'est triste.
C'est vrai.
C'est triste.
Ces cubes
ont été utilisés par l'enfant
que veut le Centre.
Tu peux sentir
quelque chose
qui nous dirait qui c'est ?
Timmy ne sent rien.
Angelo sentait.
L'heure de ma piqûre.
Tu es un petitgarçon
à part, Jarod.
Nous sommes tous à part,
à cause de notre sang.
Vos 3 échantillons.
Albert williams, Ari Thompson
et Davy Simpkins. Les trois
ont un dossier.
Jeremy ne vous a pas vu ?
Rien de plus invisible
qu'un balayeur.
Qu'allez-vous en faire ?
Les jeter à l'eau
pour faire sortir les requins.
Je suis désolé.
Encore une déception !
- Vous tenez le coup ?
- On commence à parler
d'adoption.
Mais c'est long.
On veut une chance
d'élever un enfant.
Vous aurez cette chance.
Mme Brewster n'est pas enceinte ?
Non, pas encore.
Mais j'ai trouvé
trois donneurs potentiels.
- Le labo a fait l'analyse ?
- Non, mais Mme Brewster
est dans la bonne phase
de son cycle.
Analysez-moi ça immédiatement.
Ainsi soit-il.
Espérons qu'on trouve
ce qu'on cherche.
Espérons.
Vous avez trouvé Angelo ?
Non, mais j'ai trouvé
autre chose.
J'ai pensé que Sydney
vous le montrerait.
Je fais une pause.
La dernière fois que j'ai vu
ce regard, c'était dans Bambi.
Je tournais en rond,
avec cette histoire
de naissance, alors j'ai pioché
dans les cartons de Raines
où j'ai trouvé
des vidéos personnelles.
Deux fois en trois jours ?
Broots a trouvé des choses
que vous devez voir. Asseyez-vous.
Je reste debout.
C'est la suite des images
de votre naissance.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
- Désolé, Catherine.
Le 2e enfant est mort-né.
Procédure standard
pour la fille
et sédatifs pour Catherine
en salle de réveil.
ll était vivant !
Le bébé mâle estprêt
à être envoyé à Nugenesis.
C'est quoi, Nugenesis ?
J'ai un frère...
quelque part.
Un problème ?
J'ai trouvé ces tests
de donneurs potentiels.
Je dois en contacter un
immédiatement.
ll y a un donneur idéal ?
Hélas, pas pour les Brewster.
Mais il serait idéal
pour un projet que je dirige.
Le Dr Haring ne sait rien.
Trouvez-moi rapidement
les coordonnées de ce donneur.
Je ferai de mon mieux.
C'est la maison de Davy ?
C'est la bonne adresse.
Excusez-moi de vous déranger.
Jarod Spock.
Je cherche Davy Simpkins.
Vous venez de le manquer.
- ll vit ici ?
- Vivait.
Nous sommes
ses parents adoptifs.
Nous l'étions.
lls lui ont trouvé un foyer.
ll vient de partir.
- ''lls'' ?
- L'homme
du bureau de placement.
Davy l'appelait Bonhomme de neige.
A cause de ses cheveux.
Blancs.
Le nettoyeur de Raines, Gar.
ll a dit où il emmenait Davy ?
A l'aérodrome.
Adaptation
Pascale Joseph
Sous-titrage
NlCE FELLOw
Vu dans Le Caméléon :
Ravi d'intégrer
la famille Nugenesis.
Nous sommes dévoués à la famille.
Je peux vous aider.
- Pourquoi vous croirais-je ?
- Votre mère m'a cru.
Qu'entendiez-vous par Prodige ?
Que disent les dossiers rouges ?
Angelo a retrouvé son esprit.
- J'avais un jumeau.
- On l'a enterré.
Pas le chagrin.
ll était vivant !
J'ai un frère.
ll peutpas recommencer.
lls vont voler un enfant.
Le Centre va faire
un autre Caméléon.
On m'a enlevé à ma famille.
Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà
plus doué que les autres.
Combien de gens sont morts
à cause de moi ?
Depuis mon évasion,
je cherche mon passé.
C'est un Caméléon.
Un génie qui peut devenir
qui il veut.
- Le Centre le veut vivant.
- De préférence.
ll défend les opprimés.
La vie est un don.
Vous êtes médecin ?
Aujourd'hui, oui.
Où est-il ?
- Qui ?
- L'enfant.
Prodige.
Dans un relais.
Un abri, avant de l'amener ici.
Je ne le lâcherai pas.
Que vas-tu faire ?
J'ai des portes à ouvrir.
Ca va, mon ange ?
Chérie ?
Parle-moi de mon frère.
- Je l'ai fait.
- ll n'est pas mort à la naissance.
Que dis-tu ?
Pourquoi fais-tu ça ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
Dites-moi ce qu'il a.
Désolé, le 2e bébé est mort-né.
Le bébé mâle estprêt
à aller à Nugenesis.
Papa ?
Tu n'en savais rien ?
Comment peux-tu me le demander ?
Raines.
Je m'en occupe.
Ca va ?
Ca ira quand j'aurai trouvé
mon frère.
D'une certaine façon,
c'est une bénédiction.
J'ai un fils.
J'aime le soleil.
La chaleur.
La liberté.
Quand j'ai quitté le Centre,
je marchais des heures au soleil.
J'en remplissais mes poumons.
Je me souviens, quand j'étais petit,
avant qu'on m'enferme
sous le monde...
Je me souviens...
- De quoi ?
- De la musique.
Tu te souviens d'où on t'a emmené
avant de t'enfermer sous le monde ?
Aucun souvenir.
La piqûre.
Encore deux.
Ca ravivera ta mémoire.
On doit se souvenir.
Pour le garçon.
Pour le garçon.
Rien dans l'ordinateur sur un abri ?
- Les dossiers rouges.
- Les sept.
lls étaient chez mon père.
Vous les avez volés à M. Parker ?
C'est un problème ?
Pas pour vous.
D'après Fenigor,
les réponses sont là.
lls sont désignés par des codes.
Vous croyez qu'un dossier
concerne Jarod ?
Pourquoi ?
On ne connaîît pas son âge.
Si votre jumeau
a été emmené à Nugenesis...
Jarod pourrait être votre frère ?
La réponse est à Nugenesis.
Je veux voir le garçon.
ll dort.
Vous pouvez le voir sur l'écran.
Stimulation neurologique en cours.
Ca se présente bien.
On ne rentre pas au Centre ?
ll ne peut pas être déplacé.
Ce traitement doit être fait
à heures fixes.
Demain matin, il sera prêt.
Où suis-je ?
Le code à 1 0 chiffres
sous l'expéditeur
est le même pour les 7 dossiers.
Si c'était un code d'identification ?
Quoi ?
Vous aviez raison.
C'est le code de l'expéditeur
qui a amené les enfants au Centre.
Et ?
Vous n'allez pas le croire.
Fenigor ?
Fenigor, réveillez-vous.
Je dois savoir ce qu'est Prodige.
Les dossiers rouges...
Les enfants...
Catherine...
On n'a pas pu les sauver.
Je dois savoir
où ils étaient conduits
avant d'arriver
au niveau souterrain 27.
Charleston.
Charleston, en Caroline du sud.
Boîîte Bleue ''Commencement''.
Comme la salle du souterrain 27.
ll y a d'autres fichiers ?
Réponse... dossiers rouges.
Huitième dossier.
ll est censé y en avoir 7.
C'est très beau.
J'ai entendu jouer ça
quand j'étais petit.
ll faut que tu te rappelles
où on t'a emmené.
Je sais que c'est dur.
ll y a un petit garçon en danger.
Comme je l'ai été ?
Pareil.
ll y avait des hommes.
Où t'ont-ils emmené ?
Une maison.
Une maison de verre.
Parle-moi de cette maison.
Grande.
Sombre.
Que vois-tu d'autre ?
Une statue.
Quel genre de statue ?
Une femme.
Un ange.
ll y avait écrit : Angel Manor.
Merci.
Charleston, Caroline du sud.
Je n'en sais pas plus.
Merci, Sydney.
La 1 re phase est presque finie.
Que faites-vous à ce garçon ?
On le prépare pour son avenir.
Comme quoi ?
Comme Caméléon.
Son sang dénote un don.
Je l'aide à développer son potentiel.
Comme avec Angelo ?
Angelo était une erreur.
Je tâtonnais.
La nouvelle technique
concentre la stimulation
sur les zones cérébrales
que je veux développer.
Comme vous avez fait pour Jarod ?
Jarod était un Caméléon naturel.
J'essaie seulement de le recréer.
C'était quoi ? willie !
- Où est-il ?
- Là !
Angelo est dans le conduit.
Branchez le générateur.
L'électricité est coupée.
Retournez près du garçon !
Jarod...
Comment va-t-il ?
lls lui ont fait du mal !
Comme à moi !
Combien de temps il a ?
Ses facultés motrices sont diminuées
et il ne réagit pas
aux stimuli externes.
Qu'as-tu vu, à Angel Manor ?
Des neuro-récepteurs.
C'est le même procédé
qu'il a testé sur Angelo.
ll y a un espoir.
Le traitement d'Angelo marche.
ll est avec toi ?
On pourra soigner Davy.
Peut-être.
Mais le nouveau procédé de Raines
est plus dur à inverser,
si c'est faisable.
Le cerveau ne pardonne pas.
Le temps joue contre toi.
Si on ne contre pas
le traitement de Raines,
Davy régressera à jamais ?
En effet.
Tu as 3 h au plus
pour fabriquer le nouveau sérum.
Je ne le laisserai pas faire.
ll y a autre chose
que tu dois savoir.
A propos de toi...
et de Mlle Parker.
Commencement
Vous pensez que Jarod
est le frère de Mlle Parker ?
Si Fenigor dit vrai,
les réponses sont ici.
On trouvera peut-être
les Boîîtes Bleues.
Salut, ma jolie !
La voilà, Syd.
Voilà un casse-tête
qui ne me dit rien.
Si je ne le décrypte pas,
je dormirai peut-être mieux.
J'ai trouvé !
Combien de temps ?
Dix minutes.
- Merci de m'avoir fait entrer.
- Attendez d'être sorti.
Je sais que tu m'entends.
J'ai vécu la même chose.
J'ai été toi.
Jarod va tout arranger.
Jarod arrangera tout.
Vous êtes sûr
que ça aidera le petit ?
S'il l'a à temps.
Dire que j'ai laissé refaire ça.
Vous n'êtes pas responsable.
Pour vous, si.
Toutes ces années,
j'ai demandé pardon à Dieu.
Dieu, je ne sais pas,
mais moi, je vous pardonne.
Oakview Lodge ?
La voie est libre.
Merci de m'avoir donné
ce bout de mon passé.
Et merci d'avoir soulagé
ma conscience.
Bonne chance.
Où est le garçon ?
En sûreté.
Contrairement à vous.
Désolé !
Debout.
Laissez-le !
Partez !
Vous ne savez pas
ce qui vous attend.
Je veux me rattraper.
Partez !
Pour le petit.
Les 7 dossiers rouges, plus le 8e,
comme a dit Fenigor.
Ca dit s'ils sont frère et soeur ?
Vous ne croirez pas ce que ça dit.
Je l'ai !
Ne t'en fais pas pour lui.
Content de te revoir !
Frangine.
Tu sais que j'ai un frère ?
Tu as les dossiers rouges,
toi aussi ?
M. Fenigor disait vrai, sur Prodige.
Sur le sang
et les mensonges du Centre.
- Tu serais mon...
- ll y avait huit
dossiers rouges.
- Huit ?
- Chaque dossier
représente un Caméléon potentiel
pour le Centre.
Ta mère a voulu sauver 7 enfants.
Mais la clé de ton passé
est dans le 8e dossier.
Le 8e enfant.
Je suis tout ouïe.
Nugenesis a suivi ces enfants
pour le Centre,
les a testés.
ll y a une anomalie dans notre sang,
dans nos gènes,
qui nous prédispose pour ce don.
Quel est le secret du n.8 ?
Le n.8...
c'est toi.
On a testé mon sang ?
Le tien et celui de ton jumeau
prétendument mort-né.
En fait, il a atterri à Nugenesis.
L'identité de ton frère
est dans un de ces 2 dossiers.
L'un d'eux est le tien ?
Je ne suis pas ton frère.
Mais l'un des dossiers
est le sien.
Lui ?
L'autre est celui d'un certain Bobby.
Que tu connais mieux sous le nom
de M. Lyle.
Tu veux dire
que mon frère est soit un tueur
soit un légume ?
Sans aucun doute.
J'ai besoin d'un verre.
Bien tassé.
Et lui ?
ll s'appelle Davy.
Le nouveau Caméléon.
Raines a déjà fait des dégâts.
Si Davy n'a pas cette piqûre
de sérotonine tout de suite,
son état sera irréversible.
Personne ne fait rien
avant que j'y voie clair.
Si tu veux me tirer dessus, vas-y.
Fausse bravoure.
Ca ne prend pas, avec moi.
Aide-nous !
Ta mère...
Peut-être ma mère...
est morte
en voulant sauver des enfants
comme Davy.
Fais-le pour elle.
Vas-y.
J'ai entendu tirer. Ca va ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire ?
Rien.
C'est fini.
Non, c'est pas fini.
C'est ta dernière piqûre.
- Sans elle...
- C'est un enfant.
ll mérite une enfance.
C'est trop pour moi.
Enfants volés, bébés mort-nés,
le frère de Mlle Parker...
Le souterrain 27...
C'est ma faute.
J'aurais dû arrêter Ca.
Vous pouviez faire quoi ?
Je pouvais essayer.
Catherine Parker a essayé.
Fenigor a essayé.
Elle est morte
et il va pas tarder.
Je me sentirai mort en dedans
si je ne fais rien maintenant.
Qu'est-ce que vous pouvez faire ?
Attendez !
Miss Gambettes
m'a flanqué un sacré coup.
Elle mord aussi fort qu'elle aboie.
J'imagine. Regardez ça.
C'était dans les affaires
de mes parents.
C'est une photo de vous.
J'ai vu votre père la prendre.
C'était un matin.
Vous savez si j'étais leur fils,
ou s'ils m'avaient adopté ?
Je sais qu'ils vous aimaient
beaucoup.
Où suis-je ?
En sûreté.
Vous n'êtes pas le remplaCant ?
Si.
Et tu vas aller chez toi.
Bientôt.
J'aime cette chanson.
Moi aussi.
C'est possible ?
Peut-être.
J'aurais aimé te connaîître.
Le vrai toi.
J'aurais aimé connaîître
la vraie toi.
Maman aimait cette chanson.
Elle me la jouait.
Parle-moi... d'elle.
On dit qu'elle était...
Ton portrait craché.
Son sourire me rassurait.
Sa compassion...
Si je pouvais être pareille !
Elle aimait me faire la lecture,
se promener avec moi.
Elle m'aimait.
Et je l'aimais.
Elle me manque chaque jour.
Tu la vois chaque jour.
Je sais que tu as peu de temps,
mais...
Tu te rappelles quelque chose
qui me dirait qui l'a tuée ?
Qui a tué maman ?
Je sais que c'est là-dedans.
Quelque part.
J'ai vu...
J'ai regardé...
Un homme.
Quel homme ?
Quel homme ?
Laissez-moi !
Un homme en costume sombre.
Qui ?
Je ne sais pas.
Fenigor sait.
J'espérais que tu saurais aussi.
Elle jouait pour toi.
Je joue pour toi.
C'était très beau.
Bouclez tout le personnel 24 h
pour des tests de sécurité.
Personne n'entre ni ne sort.
C'est clair ?
lci Gar.
Je suis à Nugenesis.
Je sais où ils sont.
Et... qui est avec eux.
Nous revoilà dans la course.
Dans 1 2 h, je vous mets
hors course.
ll peut voyager.
On doit partir.
Je ne peux pas te laisser partir.
Ta mère aurait fait ça ?
On rentre au bercail.
Où vous m'emmenez ?
Tu n'es pas obligée de faire ça.
Ta mère serait si fière de toi.
Arrête !
J'ai vu ton visage
quand Angelo s'est sacrifié.
Allons-y !
Ca va ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
Lâchez-moi !
Sauve Davy !
Votre arme s'est enrayée ?
Davy libre.
Mlle Parker toujours en enfer !
On ne peut pas accepter.
Se faire une nouvelle vie
n'est pas facile.
Cela devrait couvrir
tout ce dont Davy...
votre nouvelle famille aura besoin.
Si vous refusez, je comprendrai.
Si vous dites vrai,
Davy a besoin d'amour.
C'est votre famille ?
Ca le sera...
Un jour.
Sa régression est totale.
Et irréversible.
Je suis désolé.
ll aura des souvenirs ?
ll se rappellera
les choses importantes.
Où allez-vous ?
Terminer quelque chose.
Je suis sa fille.
Ma mère n'est pas là.
Elle est là...
Son esprit.
- Comment es-tu revenu ?
- Comme je repartirai.
Si tu repars.
Pourquoi es-tu venu ?
Je veux savoir qui je suis.
Je préfère mourir pour le savoir
que vivre sans.
Son état est instable.
Mes parents.
Parlez-moi de mes parents.
Qui a tué ma mère ?
L'homme au costume sombre.
Qui est cet homme ?
L'homme qui a tué votre mère.
Qui est-ce ?
Le père de Jarod.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Le signal d'alarme.
Au souterrain 27.
Le souterrain 27 ?
ll n'y a personne, là.
D'après la caméra, si.
C'est Jarod !
ll y a une fuite au souterrain 27.
- Quel genre ?
- D'après la caméra, c'est Jarod.
ll est revenu !
Encore une impasse.
Je sais ce que je dois savoir.
Vraiment ?
Après tous ces mensonges,
tu sais où est la vérité ?
Pourquoi Fenigor mentirait ?
Tu devras me tuer.
Je veux connaîître la vérité.
On vous veut vivant.
Je suis fier de toi.
Jarod, sauve-toi.
ll y a une bombe !
Pardon.

C'est la seule cellule
qui n'a pas été fouillée.
Sans barrières de torsion,
il n'y aurait pas de survivants.
C'est un vrai miracle.
Regarde !
Donne-moi un coup de main.
Je suis ravie
que tu ailles mieux, papa.
Tu as l'air fatiguée.
Je dors mal depuis l'explosion.
Tenez-moi au courant.
On a trouvé un corps au niveau
souterrain 27 hier soir.
Sidney ?
C'est trop tôt pour le dire.
Papa, si la dépouille trouvée
est celle de Sidney...
Oublie-le.
Mon rapport sur l'explosion
n'est pas une condamnation.
Sidney a posé la bombe,
mais il a agi par culpabilité
et compassion.
Ces sentiments ont tué ta mère.
Je ne les laisserai pas te tuer !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Le Triumvirat met la pression
pour qu'on change de stratégie.
Ils ne me retirent pas
le dossier Jarod ?
Jamais je ne le permettrais.
Ca créerait une émeute.
Ca n'était ni ta faute
ni la mienne.
Alors ?
Ils veulent rajouter un joueur.
On connaîtra leur choix demain.
C'est nécessaire ?
L'heure est grave.
Le labo est tombé là-dessus
ce matin.
Jarod.
Son corps
a survécu à l'explosion.
Mais peut-être pas son esprit.
Une patte de crapaud...
Une patte de crapaud...
C'est qui ?
Je crois pas qu'il le sache.
Où sont mon père et ma mère ?
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>à cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>Il défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Vous savez, pour le corps ?
C'était Sidney ?
Dieu merci, non.
C'était Garr,
le balayeur décoloré.
Ca fait une place de moins
en enfer.
C'est bizarre.
Sans blague !
Il avait disparu.
C'est vrai.
Il vit dans l'unité
de reconstitution.
Comment ?
C'est pour les fous
et les invalides.
Il est un peu les deux.
Il complote quelque chose ?
Toujours. Sidney a détruit
sa cour de récré.
Voyons s'il en trouve une autre.
Dans cette unité ?
Vous devenez folle ?
Comme tout le monde.
La police nous l'a amené.
Pas de papiers d'identité.
On l'a trouvé
en train de jouer du lasso.
Il prétend avoir fait du rodéo.
Ca ne mérite pas
la camisole de force.
Il a fallu 6 flics
pour le maîtriser.
Merci, Jimbo.
On s'occupe de lui.
Il a l'air perturbé.
Les tests révéleront le degré
de sécurité nécessaire.
Bonjour.
Je suis le Dr Goetz.
Voici le Dr Blythe.
On est là pour vous aider.
Où sont mon père et ma mère ?
Votre nom ?
Jarod.
Nom de famille ?
Je ne sais pas.
Ca change chaque semaine.
Venez avec moi.
Qui est là ?
Mon Dieu ! Sidney...
Mlle Parker.
Je vous croyais...
Mort. Laissez-leur le temps.
Que vous ont-ils fait ?
On appelle ça de la rééducation.
Mais je reposerais la bombe
pour sauver cet enfant.
Je ne peux rien faire pour vous.
Me sauver ne m'intéresse pas.
Jarod... Il a réussi
à s'en sortir ?
Physiquement, oui.
Jarod est devenu cinglé.
Il s'en est pris
à Martha Stewart aux Archives.
C'est ce que je craignais.
Qu'un jour la pression
de la vie à l'extérieur
et la vérité sur son passé
ne s'abattent sur lui.
Je dois le retrouver et savoir
à quoi m'attendre.
Son angoisse vient
du plus profond de son être.
Vous êtes aveugle.
Disons qu'il y a une justice !
Il doit y avoir quelque chose.
Apportez-moi
ce que Jarod a laissé.
On ne me laissera jamais
sortir d'ici.
Et le temps presse.
C'est peut-être ma dernière chance
d'aider Jarod,
ou de vous aider.
Qui êtes-vous
et d'où venez-vous ?
Vous ne me croiriez pas.
Essayez.
On m'a enlevé à mes parents
et j'ai été élevé au Centre.
C'est l'enfer,
en mieux meublé.
Où se trouve ce Centre ?
Partout.
Je peux dessiner ?
J'aime dessiner.
Plus tard peut-être.
Parlez-moi un peu du Centre.
Pas de fenêtres.
Pas de portes.
Pas de lumière.
Pas d'espoir.
Ils sont supprimé tout ça.
"Ils" ?
Ceux qui décidaient
de ce que je mangeais,
quand je dormais,
qui je voyais, quand je parlais.
Ils décidaient tout à ma place.
Comment faisaient-ils ?
Il y avait des yeux
dans les plafonds, les murs.
Toujours ouverts.
Toujours braqués sur moi.
Chaque minute, chaque heure,
chaque jour de ma vie.
Pourquoi vous avoir fait ça ?
Pour me contrôler.
Je suis un Caméléon.
Je peux devenir
qui je veux.
Sauf que j'ignore qui je suis.
Une fois, j'ai été psy.
C'est vraiment très surfait.
Vous ne me croyez pas.
Vous seul savez la vérité.
La vérité, toute la vérité,
rien que la vérité !
J'ai aussi été avocat.
Jamais je n'aurais douté de lui.
Jarod a été gardien ici.
Un bon gardien,
très convaincant !
Comme toujours.
Vous avez dressé une liste
de ce qui manque ?
Ca n'est qu'un bureau d'archives,
rien ne manque.
Les données
ne sont pas abîmées ?
J'ai trouvé.
Jarod.
Jarod a tapé
des dossiers.
Commandant Charles.
Il cherchait son père
dans les archives.
Catherine Parker.
Il cherchait un lien
entre son père et votre mère.
Voilà toutes ses affaires.
J'espère que ça sera utile.
La grosse artillerie !
La bibliothèque
des esprits perturbés.
Ce que Jarod a trouvé
sur son père
et votre mère a entraîné ça ?
La mère de Mlle Parker
a été tuée par le Centre.
Et son père,
M. Duplicité en personne,
dirige l'endroit.
Et il y a M. Raines,
une sorte de Dr Mengele.
Un cadavre bourré d'emphysème
qui respire
grâce à un réservoir.
Quelqu'un d'autre ?
L'homme sans pouce.
M. Lyle.
Il a tué mon frère.
Il m'a aussi tué.
Et bien sûr,
Sidney.
Qui est Sidney ?
Le Pavlov de mon chien.
Pourvoyeur, protecteur,
patriarche.
Il m'a créé.
Je suis très précieux
pour le Centre.
Pendant que je cherche
qui je suis,
eux me cherchent.
Il y croit.
C'est ce qui m'inquiète.
Placez-le en unité
à sécurité maximale.
Il est tourmenté,
mais pas dangereux.
Il a fallu six policiers
pour le maîtriser.
Je veux travailler avec lui.
Vous n'aurez pas le temps.
Vu sa paranoïa
et sa schizophrénie,
il ne risque pas de sortir.
Neuro-inhibiteurs,
antidépresseurs,
antipsychotiques.
Automédication.
Ca m'étonne de Jarod.
Tout comme cette pièce saccagée.
<i>La lumière faite</i>
<i>sur la schizophrénie,</i>
<i>Démence - le fantôme intérieur,</i>
<i>Démence précoce.</i>
Rien que des livres sur la folie.
Si on l'avait trouvé plus tôt...
J'aimerais que ça soit autrement.
Mais les pièces du puzzle
coïncident.
Pas celle-ci.
<i>Houdini s'évade</i>
Tout va bien.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Pardon d'avoir été si long
à venir.
<i>J'ai un frère.</i>
<i>L'identité de ton frère</i>
<i>est dans un de ces dossiers.</i>
<i>L'un des deux dossiers</i>
<i>est le sien.</i>
<i>Et l'autre,</i>
<i>celui d'un certain Bobby.</i>
<i>Plus connu</i>
<i>sous le nom de M. Lyle.</i>
<i>Il faut que je boive un coup.</i>
<i>Un bon coup.</i>
<i>Qui a tué ma mère ?</i>
<i>Le père de Jarod.</i>
Mlle Parker... perturbée...
effrayée...
Tu es mon frère ?
J'espère.
C'est peut-être moi
qui suis folle.
On dirait le Dr Fester !
Je vous ai cherchée partout !
- Alors ?
- Il est ici.
- Qui ?
- Lui.
Je crois que "lui"...
c'est moi.
Que viens-tu faire ici, Lyle ?
T'aider à attraper Jarod.
Ca fait plaisir
de rentrer chez soi.
Elle a l'air très triste.
Mary ? Oui.
Elle allait mieux quand
elle est entrée pour dépression.
Mais il y a 2 ans,
elle s'est échappée.
Elle a voulu se buter.
Depuis, ça a empiré.
Elle aurait dû écouter
les médecins.
Vous aussi, vous devriez.
<i>Deux patientes s'évadent</i>
<i>Tentative de suicide avortée</i>
<i>Erica Michaels portée disparue</i>
Merci d'avoir enlevé
mes entraves.
Pas de quoi.
C'est pour vous, pour dessiner.
Vous m'avez parlé
de l'endroit d'où vous venez
et des gens qui y étaient.
Mais vous n'avez jamais rien dit
sur Jarod.
Parce que je ne sais pas
qui je suis.
Mary ?
Vous savez qui c'est ?
Erica.
Elle avait un joli bracelet.
Vous avez pris la fuite
avec elle.
Dans les bois.
Cours, Erica !
On doit s'échapper !
Erica est partie en courant
dans les bois.
Elle a réussi à fuir ?
Erica est partie.
Où est-elle ?
Erica est mouillée.
L'eau est froide.
Erica est dans l'eau ?
Je la trouve pas.
Je m'approche d'elle.
Tiens bon !
Je veux que vous m'écoutiez.
Arrêtez de prendre
vos médicaments.
Ils rendent votre esprit malade
alors qu'il est sain.
Quelqu'un essaie
de vous faire oublier
et il est très important
que vous vous souveniez.
Jarod est fou, c'est clair.
C'est la seule explication.
Mais pourquoi Jarod
a-t-il perdu la tête
et comment a-t-il pu...
Comment as-tu fait
pour revenir ici ?
Je pense que le Triumvirat
et ton père
voient en moi
un homme prêt à sacrifier
sa chair
pour ses convictions.
Et non pas pour le kidnapping,
l'escroquerie
et le meurtre ?
Question de perspective.
Certains voient
un pouce manquant.
D'autres, quatre doigts
parfaitement normaux.
Je me tue à faire cicatriser
ce truc !
Mais j'ai parlé de sacrifice.
On pourrait me greffer mon gros
orteil pour reconstituer un pouce.
Nul ne reconstitue comme toi,
Bobby.
Dis-moi, Parker,
qu'es-tu prête à sacrifier ?
Ma mère a sacrifié
plus que son pouce.
Je suis prête à en faire autant.
Désolée.
Ce serait dommage
de perdre les deux.
Pourquoi Mary se serait jetée
à l'eau ? Pas pour se tuer,
mais parce qu'Erica
était dans l'eau.
A votre place,
je mangerais, Sidney.
J'ignore
quand l'occasion se représentera.
Autre chose, Raines ?
Qui est-ce ?
Un ami.
Pardon. Florence Nightingale,
ça n'est pas moi.
Vérité.
Oui, Angelo, je cherche
la vérité.
Le sang ne me réussit pas !
Qu'avez-vous découvert ?
Qui a ramené M. Lyle ?
En fait, c'est... votre père.
Mon père voulait
le retour de M. Lyle ?
D'après ce que j'ai appris,
il a tout mis en oeuvre
de l'Europe à l'Asie
pour le récupérer.
Que faites-vous ?
Broots,
je veux
les empreintes ADN
des ces échantillons.
Secouons l'arbre généalogique
pour voir qui tombe !
Restez calme
et évitez les ennuis.
Merci de vous occuper de moi.
Rendez-les-moi.
La cleptomanie
est plus forte que tout.
Contrairement aux doigts.
Vous cachez quelque chose.
Pourquoi ?
Vous êtes un cas d'école.
Vous avez tout fait
pour entrer ici.
Ni trop ni trop peu,
sans faire de mal à personne.
Mais pourquoi
voulez-vous être ici ?
C'est vous, le psy.
Il arrive que des détenus libérés
commettent des délits
pour retrouver un environnement
régi par la sécurité.
Le Centre paraît être
un environnement semblable.
Vous ne voulez pas y retourner.
Ce qui nous amène à la raison
de votre présence ici.
Pour guérir.
Sidney a retrouvé la vue ?
Bon sang, comment sais-tu ?
Du calme.
Le stress peut mener à la folie.
Hitler aurait dû faire du yoga.
<i>Comment as-tu survécu</i>
<i>à l'explosion ?</i>
Si je te le disais,
ça ne serait pas drôle.
Comment va papa ?
Mieux que toi,
quand je te retrouverai.
<i>L'agressivité déplacée</i>
mène aussi à la folie.
Tu mènes à la folie, Jarod.
Où dois-je t'appeler
Freud ou Houdini ?
C'est ce qui me rend fou.
Je ne sais pas qui je suis.
<i>Mais tu as aussi</i>
<i>tes raisons d'être insomniaque.</i>
Difficile de chercher les branches
de son arbre généalogique.
L'identité de mon frère,
c'est mon problème.
<i>Nous avons les mêmes problèmes.</i>
Les fêtes de famille
vont s'en ressentir !
Je reconnaîtrais
ce Chanel n'importe où.
Que faites-vous ici ?
On travaille.
Ensemble.
En équipe.
Une grande famille unie, hein ?
Désolée...
L'explosion résonne encore
dans mes oreilles.
Vous vous rappelez l'explosion,
Sid ?
C'est intéressant.
J'ai découvert
que tu étais parvenue
à une conclusion fausse.
Sidney n'aurait pas posé
la bombe.
C'était Garr.
Garr serait incapable d'allumer
de la dynamite avec la notice !
Pourquoi lui ?
Il a emporté
la vérité dans sa tombe.
Quelle tragédie !
Mais vous avez de la chance, Sid,
ce pantin
a corrigé en un jour
les erreurs
que j'ai mis une semaine
à trouver.
Non, la chance, c'est que
les puissances soient d'accord
avec mes découvertes.
Les puissances
d'Europe ou d'Asie ?
Celles qui comptent.
Sid, vous avez perdu la vue,
mais j'ignorais que
vous aviez aussi perdu la tête.
Vous ne comprenez pas, Parker.
C'est limpide. Vous avez vendu
votre âme pour sauver votre peau.
J'espère que vous ne finirez pas
brûlé par le type à cornes
et fourche rouge !
Tu confonds intelligence
et fourberie, je crois.
On a du travail.
"On", voilà le mot-clé.
Tu es avec nous ou pas ?
Jarod m'a contactée.
Il avait l'air
différent, perturbé.
Je suis venue chercher
son profil psychologique
pour comprendre son comportement.
Les grands esprits...
Sidney et moi, on explorait
aussi le cas de Jarod.
Il est vraiment devenu fou ?
Peut-être qu'il fait semblant,
pour ne pas se démarquer
de ceux qui le sont vraiment.
Dans un asile, par exemple.
Il y aurait sûrement sa place.
J'ai arrêté,
comme vous l'avez dit.
C'est bien.
J'ai trouvé la voiture
dans l'eau.
J'ai trouvé Erica.
Pourriez-vous me parler
de la nuit de votre évasion ?
Je vois des choses.
Je ne sais pas que croire.
Ayez confiance en vous.
Le Dr Blythe
ne contrôle plus votre esprit.
Erica et moi,
on a lié amitié ici.
Elle était gentille et...
drôle.
Au bout d'un moment,
j'ai découvert
qu'elle avait un problème.
Puis elle m'en a parlé.
Que vous a-t-elle dit ?
Elle attendait un enfant.
Le Dr Blythe
lui avait fait cet enfant.
Il a abusé d'elle
pendant sa thérapie.
Le Dr Blythe voulait
se débarrasser du bébé.
Elle avait peur,
elle était perturbée.
Alors, j'ai décidé...
de l'aider à s'échapper.
Vous êtes parties
dans les bois.
Quelque chose vous a arrêtées.
Des phares !
Le Dr Blythe.
Il l'a appelée.
Il lui a dit qu'il voulait
garder le bébé.
Je lui ai dit
de ne pas le croire.
Mais elle est allée lui parler.
Ils n'ont pas parlé.
Tout est arrivé si vite.
Il l'a tellement frappée
qu'elle a cessé de bouger.
Je voyais
qu'il paniquait.
J'étais pétrifiée
par la peur.
Je ne savais pas quoi faire.
Erica dans l'eau...
Vous avez voulu sauver Erica.
Mais le Dr Blythe vous a vue.
Il était surpris, car il croyait
qu'Erica s'enfuyait seule.
Il m'a maintenue sous l'eau
jusqu'à l'arrivée de la voiture.
- Une voiture ?
- L'infirmier.
Jimbo ?
Il y avait un témoin,
il ne pouvait pas vous tuer.
Il vous a sortie de l'eau
et a inventé cette histoire
de deux patientes
dont une évadée
et l'autre,
suicidaire et incohérente.
Je ne suis pas folle.
Mary, vous n'êtes pas folle.
Le Dr Blythe
vous a donné un traitement
pour vous persuader
de votre folie.
Mais il est temps
qu'on dise la vérité.
Pour Erica.
Et pour vous.
<i>Dr Blythe ?</i>
Officier Raines,
police du Maryland.
Désolé de vous réveiller si tôt.
Je suis occupé. Je me lève tôt.
Que puis-je pour vous ?
Il s'agit plutôt de ce que
je peux faire pour vous.
Bonne nouvelle :
on a retrouvé votre voiture.
<i>Une Mercedes de 1 994.</i>
<i>ZYP-959.</i>
Des pêcheurs l'ont retrouvée
dans un lac.
Ils ont trouvé quelque chose
dans la voiture ?
Il fait trop sombre
pour affirmer quoi que ce soit,
sauf que c'est votre voiture.
C'est drôle.
On dirait qu'elle est restée là
<i>Vous avez continué à la payer</i>
<i>sans déclarer la disparition.</i>
Vous devez être très occupé.
Parmi les instituts psychiatriques
du pays, 20 hommes
à l'identité inconnue
ont été admis ces jours-ci.
Du nouveau ?
J'en suis aux dix derniers.
Pleasant Wood,
Townsend, Maryland.
Ca paraît trop facile.
Notre cinglé est là-bas.
Pourquoi nous mènerait-il à lui ?
Pour Jarod,
c'est une façon de dire
qu'il contrôle la situation.
Le bus va partir.
Erica n'est pas là-dedans.
Je lui ai donné la dignité
qu'elle méritait.
Que faites-vous dehors ?
Je paie une dette
pour deux femmes.
Vous avez tué l'une
et failli détruire l'autre.
Vous êtes fou.
C'est un monde de fous !
Ne vous en faites pas,
vous allez le quitter !
Quel patient !
Quel médecin !
Un lâche qui fuit la vérité !
Laissez-moi sortir !
Faites un petit tour
dans votre voiture.
Erica n'a pu plaider
pour avoir la vie sauve.
Ni Mary,
quand vous lui avez donné
des hallucinogènes
pour la rendre folle !
Je n'avais pas le choix !
Laissez-moi sortir !
Trois victimes.
Trois vies détruites.
Une morte.
Une qui doit endurer
ce souvenir.
Et un bébé à qui on a refusé
sa chance !
Je n'aimerais pas
être à votre place.
Je me sentirais...
comme vous maintenant !
Laissez-moi sortir !
Heureusement
que vous êtes arrivé, Dr Ratchet.
Sinon il se serait noyé.
On va s'occuper de lui.
Il souffre de schizophrénie,
de tendance à l'autodestruction.
Entraves et isolement total.
Aidez-moi,
il a essayé de me tuer !
C'est ça !
Il ne réessaiera pas
de se faire du mal.
Il est pas médecin !
C'est un malade...
Je suis médecin !
On reviendra faire une évaluation
dans 72 heures.
Ne le croyez pas !
C'est moi, le médecin !
Je ne suis pas fou !
Où est-ce que vous exercez ?
Notre clinique
est dans le Delaware,
Jarod est notre patient.
Nous y sommes.
Et lui n'y est plus !
Prévenez l'entrée
qu'un patient s'est échappé.
<i>Un psychiatre accusé</i>
<i>du meurtre d'une patiente</i>
Votre famille vous attend.
Tout ira bien pour vous.
Je sais.
J'ai encore raté le prodige
et vous semblez avoir avalé
un rasoir.
Je me sentirais mieux
si c'était le cas.
Les résultats des tests
génétiques sur votre frère.
Concluants ?
Dites-moi que c'est Angelo.
J'aimerais pouvoir.
<i>C'est Sidney.</i>
Et votre vue ?
Je l'ai perdue pour l'instant.
Mais d'une certaine façon,
j'y vois plus clair que jamais.
Vous avez trouvé un moyen
de survivre, une fois de plus.
<i>Toi aussi.</i>
C'est un monde de fous.
<i>Mais toi, tu ne l'es pas.</i>
Tu es simplement perdu.
<i>Pour l'instant.</i>
Mais je finirai par trouver
ma voie.
Et je découvrirai qui je suis.
Peut-être que moi aussi.
- Montez.
- Merci.

<i>Papa ?</i>
<i>C'est toi ?</i>
<i>Vous entrez</i>
<i>sur un territoire tribal</i>
<i>Maman !</i>
<i>M. Fennigor, qui a tué ma mère ?</i>
<i>Le père de Jarod.</i>
Papa, c'est la vérité.
Maman n'est pas morte
comme on croyait.
Le père de Jarod l'a tuée
dans cet ascenseur.
Fennigor te l'a dit ?
Il est mourant.
Pourquoi il mentirait ?
Il a extorqué des fonds au Centre.
Au Centre ou à toi ?
Je ne voulais pas qu'il mente.
Sur ta mère.
Il a menti ?
J'espère ne pas déranger.
- Espère toujours !
- Mon ange !
Ta soeur veut retrouver le père
de Jarod au lieu de la cible.
C'est bizarre que tu parles
de Jarod, papa.
Il a mis ça sur Internet.
- Ca peut nous aider ?
- Non, on a déjà essayé.
Elle a raison,
mais j'y travaille.
Tiens-moi au courant.
Moi aussi.
Et pendant que je traque Jarod,
tu traques son père ?
Si je trouve son père,
je le trouverai.
Vous buvez quoi ?
J'ai rendez-vous avec quelqu'un.
Et moi, je vends à boire.
Donnez-moi n'importe quoi
de frais.
Jarod ?
Mike Bodie ?
Je suis en retard,
j'ai dû passer chez moi.
Vous me faites penser à lui !
A mon père ?
Le commandant Charles.
D'où mon message sur Internet.
Vous l'avez connu ?
Un attrape-rêves.
Fait par votre père.
Il y a un peu de lui là-dedans
et un peu de vous.
Je n'ai que ça.
Un reflet.
J'ai mieux que ça.
C'est mon père ?
Et moi. Il y a 20 ans.
Ca vous revient.
Vous avez reçu une balle.
Quelqu'un veut me tuer.
Désolé, Jarod.
Je ne voulais pas en arriver là.
Je peux vous aider.
C'est moi
qui vous suis redevable.
Je veux vous parler de lui
et de sa quête de rêves.
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>

Qu'est-il arrivé à M. Fennigor ?
Il a adopté la température
de la pièce, si on peut dire.
Il est mort ?
C'est ce qu'on m'a dit.
Pourquoi es-tu ici ?
Pour que Fennigor me dise
que le père de Jarod a tué maman.
Papa te l'a dit ?
Peu importe.
C'est trop tard.
On ne saura jamais.
Si, quand on trouvera
le père de Jarod.
Il ne s'agit pas
d'attraper Jarod, hein ?
C'est quoi ?
- Une vengeance ?
- Ma mère le mérite.
C'était "notre" mère.
Et notre père ?
Tu veux rouvrir
ses vieilles blessures ?
Que tu sois ma soeur
ne change rien.
Tu es belle
quand tu es en colère.
Tu ne m'as jamais vue en colère.
Ces chasseurs de primes
croient jouer
aux cow-boys et aux Indiens.
Des chasseurs de primes ?
Qu'est-ce qu'ils veulent à Mike ?
Il aime se soustraire
à la justice.
Il se prend pour un grand chef.
J'aurais préféré qu'il reste
sur son territoire.
<i>Ne tirez pas !</i>
<i>Je ne suis pas armé !</i>
<i>Protestations des activistes</i>
<i>indiens contre la mine</i>
<i>Quelqu'un essaie de me tuer.</i>
Vous relevez les compteurs ?
Pas aujourd'hui.
Je suis chasseur de primes.
Comme vous.
Comment vous vous appelez ?
Jarod...
Green.
Vos papiers ?
Dans ma voiture.
Vous allez me tuer ?
Pas si vous me laissez
tranquille.
Il est parti précipitamment.
Les fusils, ça motive.
Ils l'ont touché
et il a sauté par la fenêtre.
Vous avez un nom,
en plus du fusil ?
Kim.
Peace.
Mike Bodie est un activiste.
Plutôt un terroriste.
Il a fait sauter une mine
et il vaut 20 000 $.
Cet argent est à moi.
20 000...
il y a de quoi partager.
Je partage pas une prime.
Et un café ?
Vous êtes d'où ?
Du Delaware.
Que de chasseurs
pour un seul homme !
20 000 $, ça attire du monde.
Kimberly,
qui est ton nouvel ami ?
Un concurrent de plus.
Jarod Green.
Dennis Beers.
On cherche le même Indien.
Que le meilleur gagne.
1 00 $ que c'est l'un d'eux
qui est passé chez Mike !
Ils cherchent peut-être un mort.
Pourquoi
ils voudraient le tuer ?
Il y a eu pas mal de sang.
C'est une tactique.
Ces types sont pas des tueurs.
Au pire, Bodie se fera tabasser.
Vous ne m'avez pas tabassé.
Je suis vieux jeu.
Et vous ? Vous êtes une énigme.
Ni menottes ni arme,
voiture de location.
Et pas d'alliance.
Vous devez pas
avoir de foyer.
Je pourrais en dire
autant de vous.
Faire équipe, ça vous tente pas ?
Merci pour les crêpes, Delaware.
Broots ?
Comment vous avez deviné ?
A l'odeur.
Vous savez
ce que j'ai découvert ?
Ne vous gênez pas.
Le site Internet
que je devais trouver
est introuvable.
Jarod l'a programmé
pour changer sans cesse
de serveur.
Vous ne l'avez pas trouvé ?
Jarod est le roi de l'impasse.
Continuez à chercher.
J'ai cru avaler ma langue.
J'ai trouvé le certificat
de décès de Fennigor.
On lui a prélevé des organes.
Ses reins sont au Kansas,
son foie à New York,
sa rate à Spokane.
Il me faut une photo.
De sa rate ?
De son cadavre.
Vous doutez du dossier.
C'est que si Lyle trouve Jarod
avant moi,
Fennigor ne sera pas seul
à donner des organes.
Ca n'est pas une vengeance
contre le père
de Jarod ?
Trouvez ce cadavre
avant qu'il y en ait un autre.
Sidney ?
Et si Lyle trouve Jarod ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passera ?
Pour elle ?
Non. Pour nous.
Je suis chasseur de primes.
Ca ne suffit pas ?
Vous relevez peut-être de l'Etat,
mais ici, c'est ma région.
Il faut s'inscrire
pour y travailler.
Et j'aime pas
qu'un chasseur de primes
débarque ici sans nom.
Bodie a fait sauter une mine ?
Il y a des mines
de cuivre juste à côté
de la réserve.
Mike voulait pas de ça
près de chez lui.
Il n'habite pas dans la réserve.
Juste à la limite.
Son terrain a été partagé
il y a 1 00 ans.
J'ai une photo
de Mike petit garçon.
Vous reconnaissez l'homme
qui est avec lui ?
Demandez à Emery.
L'histoire, c'est son truc.
Tu le connais ?
Désolé.
Vous êtes pas chasseur de primes.
L'attrape-rêves de Mike ?
Il faudrait le tuer pour l'avoir.
Il a donc dû vous le donner.
Vous le connaissez ?
Je fais une thèse
sur les indigènes.
Vous êtes indien ?
Non, sauf s'il y avait
un rabbin parmi eux.
Voici mes recherches.
Ca pourra vous aider.
La compagnie minière
veut sa mort ?
Ca le ferait taire.
Merci beaucoup.
Jarod ? Sur la photo...
qui est l'homme ?
Je pense que c'est mon père.
Vous pensez ?
Quand j'étais enfant,
on m'a dit que mes parents
avaient eu un accident.
C'était faux.
Qui mentirait là-dessus ?
<i>Le Centre a un autre projet</i>
<i>pour toi, Jarod.</i>
<i>Cette technique a été délaissée.</i>
<i>Améliore-la.</i>
<i>Grâce aux tissus</i>
<i>des êtres vivants,</i>
<i>je peux recréer un visage.</i>
<i>Je dirais que c'était un homme.</i>
<i>Le père de quelqu'un ?</i>
<i>Hier, c'était il y a un an.</i>
<i>Depuis l'accident d'avion.</i>
<i>Concentre-toi sur le travail.</i>
<i>C'est une technique prometteuse.</i>
J'aimerais les ramener à la vie.
<i>Je veux vous parler de lui</i>
<i>et de sa quête de rêves.</i>
<i>L'Indien</i>
<i>se souvient de Dead Creek</i>
Chasseur de primes ?
Plus maintenant.
Qu'est-il arrivé chez vous ?
Un type m'a attaqué.
Vous l'avez vu ?
Il devait m'attendre.
Dès qu'il a tiré, je suis parti
en courant avec la photo
de votre père.
C'est peut-être infecté.
Je suis dans un motel.
Je vous soignerai.
Non, c'est moi
qui vous suis redevable.
Pourquoi ?
Votre père m'a sauvé la vie.
Je dois vous parler de lui
et de sa quête de rêves.
Vous voulez des réponses ?
Je les ai.
Un seul mot : menottes !
Vous pensez qu'à l'argent,
mais il est blessé !
Ca m'a pas l'air grave !
Un chasseur de primes
veut sa peau.
Dites-le au juge.
S'il vit assez longtemps.
D'où ça sort ?
D'une boutique de souvenirs.
<i>Après 3 ans,</i>
<i>j'ai l'impression d'approcher.</i>
Et ce qu'a dit Fennigor ?
Ton père pourrait être
<i>un assassin.</i>
<i>Tu peux l'accepter ?</i>
A moins que ça soit un mensonge.
<i>Vous avez retrouvé la vue ?</i>
Il n'y a pas de dommages nerveux,
mais je ne vois toujours pas.
Peut-être que vous ne voulez pas.
Je ne sais pas qui je suis
ni d'où je viens,
<i>ni si mon père a tué une femme.</i>
<i>Mais je prends ce que je trouve.</i>
La vérité n'est pas facile.
Mais elle est bien réelle,
ça ouvre les yeux.
Au lieu du cadavre de Fennigor,
j'ai des draps ?
C'était ça
ou un bassin hygiénique !
Comptons
sur les dons d'empathie d'Angelo.
L'aveugle guide l'aveugle.
Vengeance, mauvais.
Vengeance... entraîne vengeance.
Il ne s'agit pas de moi.
M. Fennigor,
mieux maintenant.
Il est vivant ?
Où est-il ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
Que fait Angelo ?
Il a mis le drap sur sa tête.
Fennigor est un fantôme.
Les fantômes
ne sont pas vivants.
Au Centre, si.
Et où vivent-ils
ces jours-ci ?
Dans l'unité de reconstitution.
C... A...
5...
4... 3.
Merci, Angelo.
Le chasseur de primes
prend son petit déjeuner.
Il faut bien manger !
Je commence jamais la journée
sans saucisses.
- Sans quoi ?
- Sans saucisses.
Le barman de chez Dunson
dit avoir vu Mike hier.
Selon lui, un chasseur de primes
a tiré dans le bar.
Vraiment ?
Mike aurait été touché.
Ah bon ?
Ca m'étonne pas de vous,
les chasseurs de primes.
C'est la compagnie minière
qui veut la mort de Mike.
Dites à votre ami
qu'on est pas au Far West.
J'ai des fiches sur vous.
Tous les chasseurs de primes ?
Ne dites rien à Vincent,
il me tuerait.
Ca reste entre nous.
Je pensais à la photo
de votre père. J'ai étudié
les journaux
de l'époque.
Mike était perdu dans le désert.
Il a été retrouvé
par un commandant
volontaire pour les recherches.
Il y a son nom ?
Non, mais il a sauvé Mike.
Pourquoi faites-vous ça ?
Chacun devrait savoir
qui est son père.
<i>Ta technique de reconstruction</i>
<i>faciale est impressionnante.</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est ?</i>
<i>Mon père.</i>
<i>Je l'ai sculpté, Sidney.</i>
<i>Il n'a pas de visage.</i>
<i>Je n'arrive pas à voir mon père,</i>
<i>je ne sais pas qui c'est.</i>
Vous risquez la mort
en rôdant comme ça !
Vous croyez
que je me plais ici ?
Angelo a marmonné
après votre départ.
C-A-5-4-3.
- Le centre d'archives ?
- Oui, une référence de dossier.
Perdus ?
Joli pyjama !
S'il y a quelque chose
aux archives, trouvez-le !
J'aime avoir de la visite.
M. Fennigor !
<i>Papa ?</i>
<i>C'est toi ?</i>
<i>Je n'arrive pas à voir mon père,</i>
<i>je ne sais pas qui c'est.</i>
Vous avez parlé d'un motel.
Dur de vous trouver !
Vous me reconnaissez ?
Ma mère est
Catherine Parker.
Vous l'aidiez
à sauver des enfants
du Centre.
La devise du Centre est :
"Notre prochain
est notre priorité."
Le père de Jarod
a tué ma mère.
Je ne connais pas de Jarod.
J'espère que vous trouverez
ce que vous cherchez.
On lui a brouillé le cerveau.
Comme un oeuf.
Pourquoi ne pas l'avoir tué ?
C'est ce qu'ils ont fait...
A ma mère ?
L'analogie est mauvaise,
mais pensez-y.
Pourquoi ne pas simplement
l'éliminer ?
On veut peut-être que je cherche
Fennigor dans une impasse.
M. Lyle.
Il veut trouver Jarod.
Il sait,
pour les archives ?
Angelo ne lui a rien dit.
Apportez-moi ces archives.
Des chevrotines.
Vous avez de la chance.
J'ai pas fait sauter la mine.
Pourquoi avoir fui ?
Vous savez combien de fois
j'ai été arrêté ?
J'évite toujours
de passer devant le tribunal.
Je dois défendre ma terre.
Je suis le dernier de la lignée.
Si je meurs, la tribu hérite.
Pas mal.
Engagez-moi.
Je suis un bon guerrier.
Je dois trouver mon passé.
Cet attrape-rêves
m'était familier !
J'ai agi à l'intuition.
J'ai pensé qu'en vous suivant,
je trouverais Mike.
C'était bien vu.
Vous ne pouvez pas !
Mais si !
Un seul mot : menottes.
Tous les chasseurs de primes
vont nous chercher !
Etre poursuivi me rend meilleur.
C'est ma...
voiture !
Du nouveau sur Internet ?
Tu avais raison,
c'était une impasse.
Tu seras la première au courant.
J'en suis sûre.
Et sur le front
de la vengeance ?
Tu seras aussi
le premier au courant.
Où est Helen Keller ?
Le médecin se soigne tout seul ?
C'est une thérapie.
Affronter la réalité.
Dans mon cas,
vengeance déplacée.
Se tourner
vers quelque chose de positif.
Quelque chose
qui vaut la peine d'être vu.
Ca marche ?
Vous êtes floue.
Mais vous êtes là.
Vous trouvez que ma vengeance
est déplacée ?
En posant la question,
vous donnez la réponse.
Sans vous vexer,
vous ne connaissez pas
mon point de vue.
Je n'en ai pas besoin.
Je vous ai connue petite fille.
Vous ne renoncerez jamais.
Mais je veux vous aider.
Je peux. Vous en valez la peine.
<i>Où sont mon père et ma mère ?</i>
Vous êtes un type bien, Jarod.
- Comme votre père.
- Comment était-il ?
Il disait s'appeler
commandant Charles.
Je lui ai trouvé un meilleur nom :
Aigle-qui-s'élance.
Il vivait par ici ?
Non, il s'était entraîné
à la base de Clearview.
Et il connaissait le terrain.
Et il avait perdu un fils.
On m'a parlé des recherches
quand vous étiez enfant.
Je voulais être un grand guerrier
et avoir une quête.
En errant dans les grottes,
je me suis cassé un bras.
Votre père
dirigeait les recherches.
Au bout de 5 jours,
on a arrêté de me chercher.
Mais pas mon père,
lui a continué.
Seul.
Il a dit que c'était comme
trouver son propre fils.
Mon père a appris au vôtre
à faire un attrape-rêves.
Il l'a envoyé poursuivre
sa quête dans les grottes.
Et cette grotte ?
Elle est intacte.
Il paraît qu'on peut y trouver
des réponses.
C'est ce qu'il a fait.
- Touché ?
- Oui, mais ça saigne pas.
Du caoutchouc.
Ce cow-boy n'est pas si dur !
Il n'est pas censé vous tuer.
J'ai trouvé, mais j'ignore
ce que ça signifie.
Pourquoi une boîte d'archives
sur votre mère ?
Je n'ai pas pu...
Je n'ai pas voulu ouvrir.
Ca n'est pas à moi.
Je m'en vais.
Je vous laisse.
Merci.
Les chasseurs de primes
ne veulent pas vous tuer,
mais quelqu'un d'autre oui.
Pourquoi ? Ces terrains ont été
vendus à la mine par la tribu ?
Sauf le mien.
Si vous mourez,
la tribu en hérite.
C'est insensé !
Si la tribu le vend,
qui en profite ?
Celui qui tire les ficelles.
Vincent !
Il s'occupe
des ventes de terrains
à la compagnie minière.
Le portefeuille de Vincent.
A chaque vente,
il a davantage d'actions.
Il n'a pas vendu
votre terrain,
ce qui bloque ses actions.
La solution,
c'était de vous tuer
et d'accuser
les chasseurs de primes.
Combien ?
250 000 $.
Pas mal, pour un meurtre !
Vous avez un gros calibre.
On se sépare jamais.
Je m'en souviendrai.
Kim ? C'est Delaware.
J'ai quelque chose
à vous montrer.
<i>J'ai à vous parler.</i>
Je mange !
Mike Bodie est venu.
<i>Il est furieux.</i>
Il regarde les cartes,
les dossiers, tout.
J'arrive.
<i>Liquidation de compte</i>
Plus un sou !
Appelez votre courtier.
L'homme sans nom !
Qui d'autre attendiez-vous ?
Mike Bodie ?
Je dis ça au hasard.
Je tire à l'aveuglette.
Qu'est-ce que ça fait...
de pas avoir d'arme ?
Vous faites quoi ?
Je pars à la chasse !
Et vous ?
Vous vous trompez de cible !
Vous étiez chasseur de primes
quand vous avez voulu
tuer Mike !
Il s'est dérobé à la justice !
On l'accusait de quoi ?
D'avoir fait sauter une mine ?
Elle était vide, Vincent.
Je parie
que vous êtes responsable
de l'explosion !
Il vous fallait
le terrain de Mike.
Vous saviez
qu'il prendrait la fuite.
Vous lui avez tiré dessus...
en pensant qu'on accuserait
les chasseurs de primes.
Vous avez vendu votre peuple.
C'est vrai.
Et j'ai fait sauter la mine.
Et j'ai essayé de tuer Mike.
Et maintenant,
vous êtes à court de munitions.
Et vous, de chance.
Je savais
qu'on ferait une bonne équipe.
A qui est ce pistolet, Angelo ?
Suivre le cercle.
Suivre le cercle.
Mais jusqu'où, Angelo ?
M. Lyle arrive avec votre père.
Sidney, vous y voyez ?
Mieux, Mlle Parker.
Merci de votre aide.
Papa !
Mon ange !
Pour l'autre jour...
J'ai décidé de t'écouter
et d'oublier la mort de maman.
Retrouvons Jarod, pas son père.
Je n'aurais pas dit mieux !
Voilà ce que j'appelle
une réunion de famille.
Je suis ravi.
Il est temps d'enterrer le passé.
<i>Le cercle. Suivre le cercle.</i>
Pour réaliser sa quête, il faut
aller dans un endroit sacré
où se trouvent les réponses
à nos questions.
C'est là
que votre père est allé.
Ouvrez la voie.
On m'a dit quelque chose
sur mon père.
Quelque chose de mal.
Quel genre d'homme c'était ?
Il m'a sauvé la vie.
Celle de votre père.
Personne n'est venu ici depuis.
Et ça ?
Des visions
de la quête de votre père.
L'aigle.
Il est toujours au-dessus
de nous, il cherche.
Cet aigle cherche son fils.
Le symbole de l'éternité.
Il n'abandonnera jamais
sa quête.
Les rêves de mon père.
Ou ses cauchemars.
Un cercle de feu.
Ca signifie quoi ?
Demandez-le-lui.
Je vous laisse.
<i>Papa ?</i>
<i>C'est toi ?</i>
<i>Je savais que tu n'abandonnerais</i>
<i>pas ta quête.</i>
<i>J'ai besoin de savoir une chose.</i>
<i>Tu as tué Catherine Parker ?</i>
<i>Suis le cercle, Jarod.</i>
<i>Tu as tué Catherine Parker ?</i>
<i>Suis le cercle, Jarod.</i>
L'écusson pourrait être celui
de l'escadron de votre père.
Mais la base est fermée
depuis 20 ans.
C'est une impasse !
J'ai l'habitude.
Mais il n'y a pas d'impasse
sans route.
Et j'en ai une nouvelle à suivre.
Et maintenant ?
Je vais suivre le cercle.
Quand vous le trouverez,
dites-lui qu'on est quittes.
Le cercle !
Suivre le cercle !

NICE FELLOW
Pardon, c'est ça
qu'on appelle un chili ?
Je n'en mange pas.
Le chien de la publicité
dit que c'est bon.
Vous vous trompez.
Voici notre mascotte.
Rico le Rat ?
Vous me conseillez quoi ?
D'aller ailleurs.
Voyons voir...
Je vais goûter
le "Chimijanjah".
C'est vos intestins !
<i>La peur s'est abattue</i>
<i>sur ce quartier,</i>
<i>après la disparition</i>
<i>de Sarah Rickman, 1 7 ans,</i>
<i>enlevée chez elle,</i>
<i>d'après la police,</i>
<i>tôt le matin.</i>
<i>Les parents ont fait appel</i>
<i>au ravisseur</i>
<i>pour qu'il épargne leur fille.</i>
<i>Nous demandons au ravisseur</i>
<i>de ne pas lui faire de mal.</i>
<i>Parmi les détails étranges</i>
<i>associés au crime,</i>
<i>le ravisseur a arraché les yeux</i>
<i>à des peluches</i>
<i>et laissé un message</i>
<i>sur un miroir.</i>
"La lune bleue se lève."
<i>On a besoin de toi.</i>
<i>Une chose terrible</i>
<i>est arrivée.</i>
<i>Une fille a été enlevée.</i>
<i>Tu dois la retrouver.</i>
Commissaire Fox ?
Qui est-ce ?
Un agent spécial
du ministère de la justice.
<i>Je ne peux pas, Sidney.</i>
<i>J'ai peur.</i>
<i>Tu veux aider Annie ?</i>
<i>Non, j'ai trop peur.</i>
<i>Oublie ta peur.</i>
<i>Je ne peux pas !</i>
<i>Il le faut. Toi seul</i>
<i>peut la sauver.</i>
<i>La lune bleue se lève</i>
<i>Jarod, toi seul peux la sauver.</i>
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>à cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>Il défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
C'est étrange.
Je n'ai pas appelé
le ministère de la justice.
Jarod Restler.
J'étudie le comportement
des criminels.
Rentrez à Washington.
On a assez d'hommes.
Il ne réclamera aucune rançon,
inspecteur.
Commissaire.
Celui qui a enlevé Sarah
est un tueur.
Chaque minute passée à discuter
nous rapproche de sa mort.
Il vous nargue.
Vous croyez ?
Il arrache les yeux
pour se rendre invisible.
Et ces rideaux ?
Il les a ouverts exprès.
Regardez bien.
Ils sont fermés.
Ils étaient ouverts.
Parlez.
J'ai déjà vu cette méthode.
Chez un tueur en série,
Douglas Willard.
Maxwell ?
Alerte les patrouilles.
Inutile.
Il est en prison depuis 20 ans.
- C'est allumé mais y a personne.
- Jarod tout craché.
Il est venu.
Un entraînement aquatique...
Le prodige voulait
être champion olympique ?
Pas que je sache.
Enfant,
je voulais être Aqua Man.
Avec des branchies et...
Regardez !
On dirait
qu'il est allé en Floride.
C'est trop facile.
Il a laissé ses affaires.
Un imprévu
a dû se présenter
et Jarod a avancé son départ.
Où est-il ?
Willard, alias
"le tueur de la lune bleue".
Une série d'enlèvements
sur la côte est vers 1 975.
Des jeunes femmes enlevées
dans leur chambre.
Des poupées sans yeux
et ces mots :
"la lune bleue se lève".
- S'il est au QHS...
- Il a un imitateur.
La lune bleue ?
C'est la 2e pleine lune
d'un mois.
Willard tuait ses victimes
à minuit chaque lune bleue.
Un appel anonyme
a permis à la police
d'attraper Willard,
mais il avait déjà tué
sa dernière victime.
Elle s'appelait Annie.
On n'a pas retrouvé le corps.
La voilà.
<i>Jarod, tu as fait ton possible.</i>
<i>Ce n'est pas ta faute.</i>
<i>Elle est morte à cause de moi.</i>
<i>Je l'ai laissée mourir.</i>
Si on ne l'a pas trouvée,
comment être sûr ?
Willard a envoyé une photo
du corps aux parents.
Le lendemain
de son arrestation.
Le salaud.
- On commence par quoi ?
- Par trouver l'imitateur.
Il copie soigneusement
chaque détail
de la méthode Willard.
Ca n'était pas dans la presse,
donc il est en contact
avec Willard.
Un compagnon de cellule ?
Willard a toujours été isolé.
Ni famille
ni visites.
Répertoriez le personnel
de la prison :
gardiens, médecins, avocats...
On pourrait le faire venir.
Pas sans bonne raison.
Si quelqu'un se prend pour lui...
je dois étudier l'original.
Etudiez à McCallister.
J'ai besoin qu'il soit ici.
Je ne peux rien faire.
Après-demain,
c'est la lune bleue.
Si on ne fait rien,
une fille va mourir.
<i>Vous avez du courrier !</i>
<i>Ca recommence !</i>
<i>Ce sont ses parents ?</i>
<i>Oui. Ils comptent sur toi</i>
<i>pour retrouver leur fille.</i>
Plus j'en sais sur lui,
plus je suis malade.
Doug Willard nous conduira
au ravisseur.
J'espère.
Je viens d'avoir McCallister.
Willard est en transit.
Vous m'êtes redevable.
Et comment !
Je me dis parfois
qu'on est les seules personnes
saines d'esprit, ici.
Ce qui ne m'arrange guère.
Vous n'êtes pas
dans votre assiette ?
Excusez-moi. Ca va.
Pas moi.
Raines a persuadé papa
de m'envoyer en Floride,
même si je sais
que Jarod n'y est pas.
Raines n'y est pour rien.
Ca vient de moi.
Vous disiez que Jarod
n'y était pas !
J'avais tort.
On a omis un détail.
Oubliez ce que j'ai dit.
Je suis la seule saine d'esprit.
<i>Comment saviez-vous ?</i>
Annie me l'a dit.
Cette fois, elle s'appelle Sarah.
Je ne peux pas laisser faire.
En rattrapant l'assassin,
tu en as sauvé bien d'autres.
Mais pas Annie.
On ne peut pas changer le passé.
Tu as fait ton possible.
Tu dois oublier.
<i>Willard sera transféré ici</i>
<i>demain matin.</i>
<i>Je ne l'ai jamais vu</i>
<i>en face.</i>
La fuite ne t'apportera rien.
<i>Tu sais</i>
<i>ce que tu as à faire.</i>
Jarod ?
- Laissez-nous seuls.
- Mauvaise idée.
Le psy décrit Willard
comme un perce-oreille.
Il va vous manger le cerveau.
Il a provoqué 2 suicides
et 6 dépressions.
Je n'ai peur de rien,
mais de lui, si.
Moi aussi.
Qui es-tu, mon enfant ?
Jarod sait ce qu'il fait ?
<i>Je vous remercie.</i>
<i>De quoi ?</i>
<i>20 ans au cachot...</i>
<i>C'est des vacances.</i>
Je ne l'ai pas fait
pour vous.
Alors pourquoi ?
Nous y viendrons.
C'est plutôt coquet. Certes,
je suis habitué
à plus d'intimité...
Très intelligent !
<i>Qui êtes-vous ?</i>
<i>Jarod Restler,</i>
<i>du ministère de la justice.</i>
De la justice ?
<i>Je ne me savais pas</i>
<i>si important.</i>
Vous ne l'êtes pas.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
J'étudie le comportement
des criminels.
Vous êtes un cas.
Je viens m'instruire
auprès de vous.
J'ai le sentiment
que vous mentez.
Ca me choque
que vous ayez des sentiments.
Touché.
Mon départ précipité
de mon havre de paix
me dit qu'on a besoin de moi.
C'est presque une question
de vie ou de mort.
Le FBI est impliqué.
Ca réduit le champ
des crimes possibles.
Je doute qu'on m'ait fait venir
pour un attentat à la bombe.
Comme ça, à vue de nez,
je dirais...
un enlèvement.
Mais vous aviez une raison
de me choisir, moi.
Et ça, c'est le plus facile.
Je bous d'impatience.
Demain soir,
c'est la lune bleue.
Ce qui nous mène
à une conclusion :
il y a quelqu'un d'autre.
Quelqu'un comme moi.
Très impressionné.
Vous voulez mon aide ?
Comme on dit :
quand les poules
auront des dents.
Je regrette
de vous avoir dérangé.
Je ferai en sorte
qu'on vous ramène
à votre havre de paix.
C'est tout ?
3 mn, il vous cloue le bec
et vous partez ?
Patience.
J'en ai bavé
pour le faire venir !
<i>Restler !</i>
<i>Où voulez-vous que j'aille ?</i>
On nous envoie
dans l'Etat du soleil
suivre de fausses pistes
que n'importe qui
aurait pu vérifier.
La question est : pourquoi
et quel est le rôle de Sidney ?
Il ne nous enverrait pas
perdre notre temps.
Sauf pour nous mettre
à l'écart.
Je l'ai vu regarder une photo.
La réponse est là.
Hier, une jeune femme
a été enlevée. Celle-ci.
Chaque détail correspond
à votre méthode.
Laissez-moi deviner.
Vous cherchez un homme blanc,
environ 25 ans,
célibataire, solitaire.
Ses voisins diront :
"C'était un type sans histoires."
Je connais le stéréotype.
Il me faut plus et vite.
Si je vous aide,
vous m'aiderez ?
Je vous ai fait sortir du trou.
L'imitateur
copie votre dernier enlèvement.
Il conduira sa victime
où vous aviez conduit la vôtre.
Annie...
On ne l'a jamais trouvée.
Ce sera pareil cette fois
si l'imitateur
est aussi intelligent que moi.
Ca fait quoi,
d'être le plus intelligent ?
On se sent seul.
Les forces de l'ordre
n'ont pas avancé, en 20 ans.
Ce sont les mêmes idiots
qui ont pataugé pour m'avoir.
Ils vous ont eu.
Pas à temps.
En outre,
"ils" ne m'ont pas eu.
Dans mon trou,
j'ai étudié
les responsables supposés
de mon arrestation.
Je les connais par coeur.
Et ?
Incapables d'attraper
un rhume.
Ils avaient un informateur doué.
Comment savez-vous
que ce n'était pas de la chance ?
Je suis trop intelligent.
C'était forcément un génie.
C'était mon meilleur adversaire.
Je n'ai pas pu le rencontrer.
Ca m'a beaucoup déçu.
J'entrais dans la tête
de mes victimes.
Je connaissais leur maison,
leurs pensées,
leur façon d'agir.
Pour connaître quelqu'un,
il faut entrer en lui.
C'est ce que j'aurais demandé
à l'informateur.
Depuis 20 ans, je m'interroge :
comment est-il entré en moi ?
Connaissez-vous cet homme ?
Je me demandais juste
s'il se sentait
aussi seul au monde que moi.
Comme vous dites,
les gens intelligents
sont parfois seuls.
Où l'imitateur
va-t-il la conduire ?
Là où j'ai conduit Annie.
- Où ?
- On a jusqu'à demain minuit.
Si je vous le dis,
vous me renverrez.
Répondez !
Où va-t-il la conduire ?
Du calme ! A moins
de maîtriser vos émotions,
vous ne le trouverez jamais.
<i>Non, j'ai peur !</i>
<i>Le temps presse.</i>
<i>C'est le seul moyen de la trouver.</i>
<i>Je vous en prie, non !</i>
Angelo ?
J'ai un truc à te montrer.
C'est mal, de voler Sidney.
On ne vole rien.
On regarde.
Parle-moi d'elle.
Qui est-ce ?
Elle a peur.
Annie.
Parle-moi d'Annie.
Elle veut rentrer chez elle.
Vous deviez aller en Floride.
On y est allés.
Perte de temps.
Rien de rien ?
Quelques miettes.
Pourquoi être revenus ?
Ca ne menait à rien.
Dites-lui que la Floride,
c'est du bidon.
C'est notre seule chance
de trouver Jarod.
Retournez-y.
Je viens de défaire
mes valises.
On ne va nulle part.
Ils ont dit qu'on devait.
Moi, je dis que non.
Ils cachent quelque chose.
Je veux tout savoir sur elle.
C'est la miette à suivre.
Rien sur les liens
avec le personnel ?
- J'y travaille.
- Le temps presse.
Pour eux aussi.
<i>Je veux voir ses parents.</i>
<i>Si je leur parle, peut-être...</i>
<i>C'est impossible.</i>
<i>Leurs émotions</i>
<i>brouilleraient ton objectivité.</i>
<i>Pourquoi sont-ils bouleversés ?</i>
<i>C'est leur seule enfant ?</i>
<i>Les liens entre parents et enfants</i>
<i>sont forts et fragiles.</i>
<i>Qu'importe le nombre,</i>
<i>chaque relation est unique.</i>
<i>S'ils sont menacés,</i>
<i>ils souffrent énormément.</i>
<i>Mes parents ont pleuré</i>
<i>pour moi ?</i>
Avec de l'imagination,
ça a le goût du café.
Merci.
Quand elle est allée
se coucher,
j'ignore si je lui ai dit
que je l'aimais.
Sarah sait que vous l'aimez.
Je me demande
si tout est mis en oeuvre.
Si on ne peut pas plus.
Vous aimez le pouvoir.
Faites preuve de pouvoir :
sauvez-la !
Attention.
Les émotions
vous rendent vulnérable...
Humain ?
Vous êtes une énigme.
Votre engouement me dit
que vous cachez votre jeu.
Je veux trouver Sarah.
Je veux aussi quelque chose :
la vérité.
Sur quoi ?
Vous le savez.
Pendant 20 ans,
j'ai ruminé mon arrestation.
J'ai lu tous les journaux,
tous les dossiers.
Et en 20 ans,
je n'ai rien trouvé
sur l'informateur anonyme.
C'est le mot-clé : anonyme.
Il devait me connaître,
m'avoir étudié
comme je m'étudie.
Vous me connaissez bien.
J'ai lu votre dossier.
Vous en savez plus
que le dossier.
Vous savez
qui je suis vraiment.
Et je me demande
qui vous êtes vraiment.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fout ?
Nous partageons un secret.
Vous n'étiez qu'un enfant.
Un prodige.
Je l'ai entendu dire, oui.
Comment saviez-vous ?
Ca se voit.
Je sens votre solitude.
Un enfant aide la police
à attraper un génie.
Très impressionné !
J'ai aidé
à attraper un monstre.
Mais pas à temps
pour sauver Annie.
Ca a dû être terrible,
pour quelqu'un
d'aussi humain que vous.
Je me demande
ce qui arrivera
à la petite Sarah.
Comme vous dites...
le temps presse.
<i>Elle dort quand j'entre.</i>
<i>Tout le monde dort.</i>
<i>Je le sais.</i>
<i>Je les ai observés.</i>
<i>Continue, Jarod.</i>
<i>Je veux m'approcher d'elle,</i>
<i>mais je ne peux pas.</i>
<i>Ils me regardent.</i>
<i>Je dois les en empêcher.</i>
<i>Je suis invisible.</i>
<i>Pourquoi ouvrir les rideaux ?</i>
<i>On risque de te voir.</i>
<i>Le clair de lune.</i>
<i>Je veux le sentir sur moi.</i>
<i>Je ne peux pas continuer.</i>
<i>Si, tu peux.</i>
<i>Je ne veux pas être</i>
<i>dans sa tête.</i>
<i>Ni l'avoir dans la mienne.</i>
<i>Il le faut.</i>
<i>Je ne peux pas !</i>
<i>C'est le seul moyen</i>
<i>de trouver Annie.</i>
<i>Non ! Je ne veux pas</i>
<i>ressentir ça.</i>
<i>Je ne veux pas</i>
<i>ressentir ça.</i>
Je vous écoute.
Pourquoi avez-vous débranché
la caméra de Willard ?
L'intimité.
La sienne ou la vôtre ?
Je sais ce que je fais.
Il vous réclame.
Parlez-moi.
Soyez plus précise.
Raines me met à l'écart,
vous le soutenez. Pourquoi ?
Vous devenez parano.
Et ça, c'est une vision ?
Qu'est-ce qui "recommence"
et pourquoi on me le cache ?
Ne cherchez pas.
Toutes ces années,
je me demandais qui vous étiez,
mais au fond de moi, je savais.
Jarod est votre vrai nom ?
Etes-vous du ministère
de la justice ?
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Vous vouliez me voir.
Il la gardera jusqu'à
ce que la lune soit pleine.
Jusqu'à minuit.
Je le savais déjà.
Vous savez déjà tout.
Mais vous refusez
de faire ce qu'il faut.
Aidez-moi.
Pourquoi j'arrachais
les yeux des poupées ?
Pour devenir invisible.
Pourquoi ouvrir les rideaux ?
Pour sentir le clair de lune.
- Et lui ?
- Pour la même raison.
- Où est-il ?
- Je l'ignore.
- Où est-elle ?
- Je l'ignore !
Faites ce qu'il faut faire.
Je vous avais laissé
les réponses
pour trouver Annie.
Entrez dans sa tête.
Entrez dans ma tête.
Où est-elle ?
Je l'ignore.
Vous ne m'avez pas demandé
ce que je voulais.
Vraiment ?
Et que voulez-vous ?
Conduisez-moi sur place,
dans la chambre de Sarah.
- Pourquoi je ferais ça ?
- Je le sens.
Je ferai
ce que vous refusez de faire :
être lui.
<i>Je ne veux pas être lui !</i>
Ils refuseront.
Vous êtes un génie.
Vous trouverez un moyen.
Faites-le pour Sarah,
pour Annie.
Restler, on a trouvé le ravisseur.
Il s'appelle Paul Schuman.
Gardien pendant 6 ans
à McCallister,
assigné au cachot et...
- A Douglas Willard.
- Il y a mieux.
Willard et Schuman
ont développé des liens.
Il y a 1 8 mois,
Schuman craque et disparaît.
Il n'y a plus de fruits,
mais on a trouvé l'arbre.
Dans 8 heures,
la lune sera pleine.
Regardez.
Sarah, chez elle.
Attendant le bus.
Il a même son emploi du temps.
Nantauk, New Bedford, Cape May.
Schuman a suivi l'itinéraire
de Willard.
Visite historique ?
Scientifique.
Il se met
dans la peau de Willard.
En enlevant Sarah,
il reprend où Willard
s'était arrêté.
Par ici. Des lettres de Willard.
Jusqu'à la semaine dernière.
C'est du charabia.
Un code pour passer
la censure carcérale.
Willard a parasité son cerveau.
La question est :
Schuman est-il un imitateur
ou un pantin ?
On fait quoi ?
On donne à Willard
ce qu'il veut.
Vous m'emmenez avec vous ?
Parlez-moi de Schuman.
Répondez-moi d'abord.
C'était votre gardien, avant
que vous n'entriez dans sa tête.
Un admirateur influençable.
Mais c'est sans importance.
Comme vos lettres ?
Vous êtes à l'origine
de l'enlèvement de Sarah.
Schuman, c'est vos yeux,
vos oreilles et vos jambes !
Il n'y a plus que vous et moi.
Déjà vu.
Le serpent se mord la queue.
Vous redevenez
l'enfant qui a peur.
Vous connaissez l'assassin,
sans pouvoir sauver la fille.
Pas tout seul.
Où a-t-il conduit Sarah ?
Où j'ai conduit Annie.
Dites-le-moi.
Faites ce qu'il faut faire.
Emmenez-moi là-bas.
On peut encore l'arrêter.
Il n'ira nulle part.
Agent Restler,
j'ai à vous parler.
- Vous êtes dingue ?
- En l'emmenant sur place...
Requête rejetée.
Une vie est en jeu.
Et plus encore s'il s'échappe.
Requête rejetée.
Je vous croyais sûr de votre fait,
mais il est entré
dans votre tête. Dehors !
Montez.
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez ?
Je vais régler ça.
- Sans autorisation ?
- Ecartez-vous.
Je refuse.
On n'a plus le temps.
Plus le temps.
Quelle violence, prodige !
Vous sentez ?
La mort.
C'est étonnant
comme les chambres
de petites filles se ressemblent.
Dites-moi où elle est.
Je ne peux pas bien travailler
dans ces conditions.
Délivrez-moi
et je vous délivrerai.
Au moindre éternuement,
je mets fin à tout ça.
En fermant les yeux,
on entend presque
ses cris étouffés.
Elle dort, quand il se glisse
dans sa chambre.
Elle est enrhumée.
Sa respiration
est plus lourde que la normale.
Ca lui plaît assez.
Et alors ?
Il remarque les yeux.
Il ne faut pas de témoins.
Il s'assoit sur le lit.
Il l'observe.
Il perçoit un doux parfum
de sucré...
Et ça ?
Du shampooing.
Ensuite ?
A vous de me le dire.
Dites-le-moi !
<i>Je ne veux pas</i>
<i>qu'il entre en moi !</i>
Que fait-il ensuite ?
Il a envie de crier.
Il se sent...
tellement bien...
tellement sûr.
Il l'emmène
dans le couloir ?
Ils passent la chambre
des parents.
Il s'arrête.
Ils dorment.
Ils ont l'air...
innocent.
Insouciant.
Où va-t-il ensuite ?
Je l'ignore.
Sentez. La lune est pleine,
minuit approche...
Je vous ai amené ici.
A vous de me dire où elle est.
Ce doit être frustrant
d'être si près... et si loin.
Dites-moi où elle est !
Suivez les indices.
Agissez !
Je ne sais pas !
Dites-moi où elle est.
C'est tellement évident !
Pourquoi je ne trouve pas ?
Ca ne colle pas !
Parce que c'est un vaste mensonge.
Il n'y a ni rime ni raison
dans tout ça.
Pas de minuit,
pas de "lune bleue".
Ca ne veut rien dire.
Je les ai tuées
parce que je le voulais.
J'aime ça.
Il est temps que je voie Sarah.
J'espérais un adversaire
plus à la hauteur, prodige.
Adieu, Jarod.
Le monstre s'en va, maintenant.
Du nouveau sur la fille ?
Pas grand-chose. Aucune trace
de son nom de famille.
Ne me dites pas
ce que vous n'avez pas trouvé.
J'ai trouvé une chose :
elle a été enlevée
et assassinée il y 23 ans.
On n'a pas retrouvé
son corps.
Où est-ce arrivé ?
A environ 60 km.
A Snow Hill dans le Maryland.
Snow Hill.
<i>On recherche toujours</i>
<i>la petite de Snow Hill</i>
Qui es-tu, mon enfant ?
Tiens, le jeune prodige !
Ca fait quoi,
d'être le plus intelligent ?
On se sent seul.
Vous allez retourner au trou.
Vous m'avez trouvé.
Mais là encore,
trop tard
pour sauver la petite.
Pas cette fois.
La requête
pour visiter la chambre
était un coup monté.
Comme de vous conduire ici.
Je vous ai suivi.
En fait, je vous ai devancé.
Comme nous tous.
Carl Schuman
n'est jamais venu ici.
Prodige ?
Vous êtes entré dans ma tête.
Non.
Inutile de devenir un monstre
pour en affronter un.
Elle est ici.
Ca va aller.
On est venus vous aider.
On ne vous fera plus de mal.
Emmenez-la.
Agent Restler ?
Il est temps de rentrer
chez toi, Annie.
Je cherche cet homme.
Agent spécial, c'est ça.
Où est-il ?
Juste là.
<i>Tu l'as sauvée, Jarod.</i>
<i>J'aurais aimé sauver Annie.</i>
<i>Pour ses parents.</i>
Je sais que tu as essayé.
J'espère que le fait
de pouvoir l'enterrer
les apaisera un peu.
J'en suis certain.
J'ai donné la médaille
à son père.
<i>Il aimerait que je te remercie.</i>
<i>Je suis désolé.</i>
<i>Sincèrement désolé.</i>
Pourquoi me balader
au lieu de me dire
la vérité ?
Il le voulait ainsi.
Je ne comprends pas.
Parfois,
même le diable
a droit à l'intimité.

NICE FELLOW
Vous avez oublié
ce que je vous ai dit ?
Ne revenez pas ici.
Je ferai tout.
Il me faut à manger.
Pour mon enfant.
Ce n'est pas une auberge.
- Un problème ?
- Je ne vous avais pas vue.
Il est gênant ?
Il me réclame du travail.
Donnez-lui ma table.
Traitez sa famille
comme tous nos clients.
Ensuite,
préparez un panier-repas
et donnez-lui de quoi payer
Un problème ?
Non, madame.
Faites venir votre famille.
Dieu vous bénisse.
La dignité est une chose volée,
pas donnée.
La famille,
c'est important de la protéger.
C'est tout ce qu'on a.
Vous n'êtes pas de Clear Bay.
Non, en effet.
Voyage d'agrément ?
D'affaires.
J'espère
que vous vous plairez ici.
Votre nom...
Votre C.V. est impressionnant.
Imparfait mais impressionnant.
Imparfait ?
A Seattle,
vous avez frôlé la prison.
Je suis là, n'est-ce pas ?
M. Kincaid veut un professionnel.
S'il est lié, même de loin,
à des actes incendiaires,
il faudra faire autrement.
Je ne vous suis pas.
On ne sait rien de vous.
Vous voyez ce bateau
au bout du quai ?
Il appartient au shérif.
Randall Carver.
C'est lui, là-bas.
Ce bateau est sa vie.
Plus maintenant.
Mon bateau !
Marché conclu ?
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>à cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>Il défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Il y a quelqu'un ?
Je consultais les fichiers.
Je retourne à mon boulot.
<i>Le voilà !</i>
<i>Le 2e bébé est un garçon.</i>
<i>Mort-né.</i>
Harold Kincaid.
Merci d'être venu, M. Burns.
Le papillon Vénus.
S'il se pose sur vous,
on dit que ça porte chance.
La chance ne l'a guère aidé.
En effet. J'ai entendu parler
de votre coup d'éclat
ce matin.
Un vrai feu d'artifice.
Le shérif n'est pas à la fête.
L'enquête préliminaire
conclut à l'accident.
C'était l'idée.
Propre, professionnel.
Contrairement à la dernière fois.
La dernière fois ?
J'ai lu les journaux.
Des gens sont morts
dans votre immeuble.
C'était un boulot d'amateur.
Je n'ai pas besoin de ça.
Tu n'es pas en ville ?
J'ai demandé à Doris
de préparer à dîner.
Pas le temps.
Manny m'a parlé de ta scène
avec ce SDF.
C'était plus qu'un SDF.
Sa petite fille
avait l'air d'avoir faim.
Ma femme a un faible
pour les feignants.
Jarod.
Il est architecte.
Je vais lui confier
l'immeuble en ville.
Vous connaissez un bon hôtel ?
En cette saison,
tout est complet.
La maison d'amis est vide.
Je ne veux pas déranger.
Mon mari a un faible
pour les ambitieux.
La gouvernante
vous l'ouvrira. A demain matin.
Ne m'attends pas.
Je jure qu'il pleurait.
Il regardait sa propre naissance.
Se voir arraché à sa famille,
ça brise le coeur.
Depuis quand Lyle
a-t-il un coeur ?
C'est si dur de croire
qu'il se sent perdu ?
Après tout,
Catherine était aussi sa mère.
Elle lui a donné la vie,
pas son caractère.
Les gens changent.
Appelez ça un éveil.
Il s'agit d'un homme
qui a tué de sang-froid.
On ne s'éveille pas de ça.
On a livré ça pour vous.
Ca ressemble
à l'écriture de Jarod.
Elle est jolie.
"La confiance te tuera
ou te délivrera."
J'ai déjà entendu ça.
C'est énigmatique.
Jarod n'a pas envoyé ça
sans raison.
Cherchez qui elle est.
J'ai grandi loin d'ici.
Nous sommes deux.
Je vous imaginais petite fille,
avec un poney,
comme Alice
au Pays des Merveilles.
J'ai perdu mes parents
dans un incendie, bébé.
Ma tante m'a élevée dans
une roulotte à Corpus Christi.
Ca a dû être dur pour vous.
Elle m'aimait.
C'est mon dernier souvenir
de bonheur véritable.
Vous avez de la famille ?
J'ai une soeur quelque part.
Mon frère a été tué
il y a six mois.
Je suis navrée.
Et vos parents ?
Je ne les ai pas vus
depuis l'enfance.
Je les cherche encore.
Ne renoncez jamais.
Votre plus cher désir
peut être au coin de la rue.
Vous cachez votre jeu.
Je sais ce que fait mon mari.
Vous n'êtes pas venu
bâtir un immeuble,
mais le brûler.
Ce n'est pas...
ce que je suis vraiment.
Je vous crois.
Vous êtes bon.
Je le lis dans vos yeux.
Mon mari était bon, autrefois.
Hélas, les gens changent.
Bonne nuit.
Papa ?
Mon ange...
Tu as encore changé de coiffure ?
Ca te plaît ?
Non. C'est ta tête.
Je dois te parler de Lyle.
Je ne veux pas sembler parano,
mais il manigance quelque chose.
- Il t'a menacée ?
- Non.
Je l'ai vu regarder le DSA
de ma... notre naissance.
Et ?
Il pleurait.
Je vois. Tu as pris ça
pour de l'hostilité ?
Non, mais vu son passé,
j'ai trouvé ça étrange.
Ma chérie,
Lyle est un homme très compliqué.
Laisse-moi finir.
Il est venu me voir
pour purger son âme.
Disons qu'il subit
une transformation.
Il m'a demandé
où est enterrée ta mère.
Tu te rends compte ?
Non.
Ca a été dur pour toi,
de te découvrir un frère.
Mais ce n'est pas facile
pour lui non plus.
Pense à ça.
Et j'aime ta coiffure.
<i>"La confiance te tuera</i>
<i>ou te délivrera. "</i>
J'ai lu.
Qui est sur la photo ?
Quelqu'un qui a mal choisi
ses amis.
<i>Comme nous tous.</i>
Certains font pire que d'autres.
<i>Comme tuer une innocente</i>
<i>dans un ascenseur ?</i>
Qu'essaies-tu de me dire ?
Ne te méprends pas sur les gens.
J'ouvre l'oeil.
<i>A toutes les possibilités.</i>
Car au bout du compte,
on n'a que ce qu'on mérite.
<i>Un incendie fait 11 morts</i>
<i>Origine inconnue</i>
Jarod, au secours !
C'est Harold.
Il y a eu une explosion.
Le feu !
Je n'ai pas pu l'approcher.
- Où est-il ?
- Dans la chambre.
Appelez les secours !
- Restez ici.
- C'est mon mari !
Que les pompiers
aient accès à la chambre.
Bouclez le balcon.
L'origine du feu
reste inconnue.
Ca me rappelle mon bateau.
Quel gâchis !
Vous ne voulez pas
vous allonger ?
Mme Kincaid,
j'ai des questions à vous poser.
- Maintenant ?
- Vous êtes l'avocat ?
Tom Byner est mon avocat.
Il arrive.
Vous préférez attendre,
ou me raconter ?
Où voulez-vous en venir ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
M. Burns est un associé
de mon mari.
- Que voulez-vous savoir ?
- Tout.
Je suis allée
me coucher vers 22 h.
Harold n'était pas là.
Il avait un rendez-vous
d'affaires.
Je m'étais endormie.
Je me souviens qu'Harold
est entré dans le lit.
Je ne sais pas
quelle heure il était.
Et ensuite ?
Ca va aller.
Je me suis tournée
de l'autre côté du lit
et me suis rendormie.
A un moment donné,
tout a explosé.
J'ai entendu Harold crier.
Je me suis retournée.
Il était en feu.
J'ai voulu l'approcher,
mais je ne pouvais rien faire.
Alors, je suis descendue
et j'ai trouvé Doris,
notre gouvernante,
qui m'a dit ce qu'elle avait vu.
Une silhouette... Un homme
qui courait vers les bois.
C'est tout ce que je me rappelle.
Vous allez devoir m'accompagner,
Mme Kincaid.
Vous l'arrêtez ?
Si ça colle,
elle sera là demain matin.
C'est absurde.
Elle en a assez enduré.
La déclaration de la gouvernante
vous innocente,
mais j'apprécierais
que vous restiez dans les parages.
Belle fille.
Elle s'appelle Shay Ling.
C'est écrit ici.
Elle vient du Xinjiang,
une région pauvre de Chine.
Venez-en au fait.
Elle a demandé un visa
il y a 2 ans.
Un an après, elle atterrissait
dans la ville-néon.
Las Vegas est la capitale mondiale
du mariage.
Shay Ling
est une fiancée sur commande.
Cherchez.
Police de Las Vegas,
registre des mariages.
Je veux cette fille.
Des hommes qui commandent
des femmes comme des pneus neige !
Je vous rappelle plus tard.
Ca va aller ?
Merci d'être venu.
Carver a été dur ?
J'ai connu de meilleures nuits,
mais je le crois satisfait.
Du moins pour l'instant.
J'ai demandé à la gouvernante
de vous préparer une chambre.
Je ne peux pas retourner
dans cette maison.
Où puis-je vous conduire ?
Nous avons une cabane
à l'extérieur de la ville.
Pourriez-vous m'y conduire ?
Bien sûr.
Harold et moi adorions
cet endroit, surtout au début.
Je ne veux pas
sembler cavalier...
mais votre mari
ne vous traitait pas très bien.
Autrefois, si.
L'homme que j'ai épousé
était tendre et attentionné.
Il ne l'est pas resté.
Je dois vous dire une chose.
La vraie raison de ma présence
à Clear Bay était...
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Une fuite, on dirait.
Harold n'a jamais pu la réparer.
Quand les types du gaz
en réparaient une,
une autre apparaissait.
Je peux fermer la conduite,
mais vous devriez
faire remplacer ça.
Oui, elle est ici.
Tom Byner.
Je n'ai pas envie d'en parler.
Je vous rappelle.
Byner veut lire le testament.
Maintenant ?
Un problème avec le fisc.
Je ne me sens pas d'attaque.
J'ai peur, Jarod.
Je sens que la police
me trouve suspecte.
Pourquoi ?
Le domaine vaut des millions.
Votre gouvernante
a vu un homme s'enfuir.
- Aucune preuve.
- Je m'en charge.
Je leur prouverai
qu'il y avait quelqu'un d'autre.
Il y a si longtemps
qu'on ne s'est pas occupé de moi !
Faire ses adieux
à quelqu'un qu'on a pas connu...
On a beau se démener
pour arriver tout en haut,
quand on y est,
on se dit
qu'on n'a rien compris.
Tu parles d'elle ?
Non, de moi.
J'ai fait pas mal d'erreurs.
Je me trouvais toujours
une excuse.
Je ne veux plus
accuser mon passé,
à présent.
Pour avancer,
je dois repartir à zéro.
Elle était très compatissante.
Je n'ai pas eu de seconde chance
avec elle.
J'aimerais en avoir une
avec toi.
Où est le hic ?
Qui êtes-vous, M. Burns ?
Je vous l'ai dit : un architecte.
Et moi, Cindy Crawford.
Mon seul crime
est de tomber mal.
Je doute que Mme Kincaid
soit de cet avis.
Elle peut s'appuyer sur vous.
C'est une femme très gentille.
Et le suspect numéro 1
d'une affaire de meurtre.
Elle n'y est pour rien.
Peut-être, peut-être pas.
Laissez la police faire l'enquête.
Une enquête en or pour un flic.
Pardon ?
Vous cherchez quoi ?
La justice ou une condamnation ?
Je cherche la vérité.
Nous la découvrirons.
<i>La gouvernante m'a dit</i>
<i>ce qu'elle avait vu :</i>
<i>un homme qui courait</i>
<i>vers les bois.</i>
L'assassin revient toujours
sur le lieu du crime.
Là, je regrette de ne plus fumer.
Quelque chose vous tracasse ?
Lyle est mon frère
et il semble sincère.
Je veux lui faire confiance,
mais...
"La confiance te tuera
ou te délivrera."
Je me souviens
qui m'a dit cette phrase.
- Confucius ?
- Votre mère.
J'ai reçu ça
de la police de Las Vegas.
Un appel de Shay Ling
le soir de sa disparition.
Passez-le.
<i>Aidez-moi !</i>
<i>Il va me faire mal.</i>
<i>Parlez moins vite.</i>
<i>Lui en colère.</i>
<i>Toujours en colère.</i>
<i>Il va me frapper.</i>
<i>Il revient !</i>
<i>Qui ? Votre mari ?</i>
<i>Où êtes-vous ?</i>
<i>223, résidence Desert Vista.</i>
<i>Il va me tuer !</i>
La police a trouvé
l'appartement vide.
- Le mari sur commande ?
- Disparu.
Comme tout ce qui la relie
à elle.
Pas d'acte de mariage ?
On doit pouvoir trouver.
Shay Ling
n'apparaît sur aucun fichier.
Tout ce qui la concerne
se dérobe sous nos yeux.
Un pli pour vous, Mlle Parker.
Encore un cadeau de Jarod.
C'est votre père !
<i>Où êtes-vous ?</i>
<i>223, résidence Desert Vista.</i>
<i>Il va me tuer !</i>
Résidence Desert Vista.
C'était votre père
que Shay Ling redoutait tant ?
Où allez-vous ?
Chercher quelqu'un de confiance.
<i>Redites-moi pourquoi</i>
<i>vous êtes à Clear Bay.</i>
Je faisais un chantier
pour Harold Kincaid.
Le même genre qu'à Seattle ?
J'ai enquêté sur vous :
vous avez été arrêté 6 fois
pour incendie criminel.
J'ai un mort,
un incendie louche
et du baratin.
Pas besoin d'être un génie.
Pourquoi tuer Kincaid ?
Je ne l'ai pas tué.
Vous étiez sur les lieux.
Et les empreintes de pas ?
Vous avez pu les poser là.
Relevez-les.
<i>Kincaid vous a renvoyé ?</i>
<i>Vous l'avez brûlé pour ça ?</i>
Répondez !
Je ne dirai rien.
Ce qui vous place
en tête des suspects.
Il vous faudrait plus de preuves.
Ca regarde la police.
Plus maintenant.
Mme Kincaid m'a engagé
pour représenter M. Burns.
Kristi vous envoie ?
Si vous avez des preuves,
inculpez-le.
Sinon, relâchez-le immédiatement.
Que voulait dire Burns,
avec les empreintes ?
Vous avez regardé ?
Histoire de m'instruire.
Un appel pour vous.
Une urgence.
Reprenez donc votre ronde.
Vous voulez
que le système s'écroule ?
Jarod !
J'étais si inquiète...
Quand j'ai appris
ton arrestation...
Tout va bien, maintenant.
C'est comme un mauvais rêve.
Je suis là.
Doris ?
Excusez-moi.
J'ai quelque chose à vous montrer.
Tout va bien ?
Je croyais en toi.
Je pensais pouvoir
te faire confiance.
De quoi parles-tu ?
Essence, détonateurs,
minuterie...
Tu l'as tué
pour être avec moi ?
Je n'y suis pour rien.
Pourquoi Doris a trouvé ça
dans ton armoire ?
J'avais confiance en toi !
Lâche-moi !
Pas avant
que tu m'aies écouté.
Je voulais punir ton mari.
Mais quand je t'ai rencontrée,
tout a changé.
Je ne suis pour rien
dans sa mort.
Je ne ferais jamais
une chose pareille.
Surtout à quelqu'un comme toi.
Il faut me croire.
C'est Doris.
Elle a appelé le shérif.
Va-t'en.
- Je n'ai rien fait.
- Carver pense que si.
Tu dois partir.
Va à la cabane
et attends-moi là-bas.
Je vais appeler Tom Byner.
Je suis innocent.
Il faut me croire.
On peut parler ?
Avec plaisir.
Il y a des choses
que je dois te faire partager.
J'ai trouvé une photo.
Elle m'intrigue.
Une photo ?
Une photo de...
Plus tard.
Je crois que ça nous concerne
tous les deux.
Il faut qu'on parle.
Excuse-moi.
Que voulez-vous ?
J'ai parlé au shérif de Tahoe.
Il a reconnu la photo
de Shay Ling.
On l'a retrouvée
Elle a été enterrée
dans la fosse commune.
Mon père aurait épousé
une femme sur commande
et l'aurait tuée ?
Pas exactement.
L'acte de mariage
a été effacé,
mais Broots a trouvé
cette photo dans un journal
de Las Vegas.
Enfoiré !
<i>Harold n'a jamais pu la réparer.</i>
Burns !
Je sais que vous êtes là !
Réglons ça gentiment.
Une saute d'humeur ?
C'est ça, ta protection ?
Tu ne comprends pas.
J'ai parlé au shérif.
Il est de notre côté.
De notre côté ?
Il a sorti son arme.
Il veut te parler.
Je lui ai dit
que tu n'aurais jamais fait ça.
S'il te plaît,
entre lui parler.
Je veux qu'on en finisse.
Je sais.
Je t'aime.
Mon ange.
Il faut qu'on parle.
Tu as l'air
d'avoir vu un fantôme.
Plutôt la Faucheuse.
J'ai failli baisser ma garde.
Les larmes pour maman,
la confiance,
une seconde chance...
Elle n'en a pas eu, elle.
Tant mieux, si tu sais.
Tu avoues la connaître ?
Evidemment, il l'avait épousée !
Tu sais tout ça ?
Il s'est confié à moi.
Tu es allé à Las Vegas.
J'ai une photo de toi
sortant de chez elle.
Il m'a aidé à régler
quelques détails.
Comme maquiller un meurtre ?
Tu n'as pas le droit !
Je craignais...
que ça lui soit arrivé.
Tu n'en savais rien ?
Je n'ai pas tué Shay Ling.
Je l'aimais !
Pourquoi ce secret ?
Les couples ont des problèmes.
Je suis rentré
un jour et elle était partie.
Avec une sorte de vagabond,
à ce qu'on m'a dit.
Elle est partie
car tu la battais.
Il ne l'a pas touchée.
Qu'en sais-tu ?
Il me l'a dit.
L'erreur est humaine.
Accorde-lui une chance.
Je ne cherche pas à me justifier,
mais je ne suis plus
celui que j'étais.
J'ai changé.
J'espère qu'un jour,
tu comprendras.
Que tu l'accepteras.
Cette affaire ne vaut pas
tout ce remue-ménage.
Nous sommes une famille.
Agissons de la sorte.
J'exige que nous allions dîner
tous les trois, ce soir.
Si on ne fait pas confiance
à sa famille, alors à qui ?
Je garde les petits bagages.
Envoyez les malles à l'aéroport.
Vous devriez retarder ce voyage.
Le testament de Harold
est inattaquable.
Il est mort
depuis à peine 8 jours.
Hier, Burns et Carver
ont sauté dans votre cabane.
N'ayez pas l'air
si impatiente de partir.
Je vais vous dire une chose.
Jarod Burns a tué mon mari,
puis Carver pour se protéger.
C'est une chance qu'il ait foiré
et se soit tué.
Je pars à Paris.
Vous avez appelé la banque ?
L'argent sera viré à Paris
à la fin de la semaine.
Vous êtes sûr ?
On ne peut pas
l'envoyer à Paris ?
Il y a un ajout au testament.
Sans votre signature,
vous perdez une somme.
Combien ?
50 000 dollars.
Mais avec un héritage
de dix millions,
je ne pense pas
que ça vous inquiète.
Je ne vous paie pas pour penser.
Retardez mon départ
et faites-moi parvenir
ces papiers.
Faites-le !
Bonjour, Mme Kincaid.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Vous m'avez aidé au restaurant.
Que faites-vous ici ?
Ma fille voulait dire merci
et nous vous présentons
nos condoléances pour votre mari.
C'est une propriété privée, ici !
L'adjoint nous a laissés entrer.
J'espère qu'on ne dérange pas.
Je vous ai vu mourir.
Tu aurais dû prendre ce vol.
Mais tu n'aurais pas renoncé
à 50 000 $.
Tu devrais t'asseoir.
Tes jambes flageolent.
Je t'ai vu entrer
dans la cabane...
Tu as vu ce que tu voulais voir.
Tu ne nous as pas vus sortir
par derrière
avant que ta bombe explose.
Le shérif Carver a avoué
le meurtre de ton mari
et il t'a impliquée
dans l'affaire.
C'était très ingénieux.
Tu avais couvert tes arrières.
Quel meilleur complice,
pour un meurtre,
que l'homme chargé de l'enquête ?
Et quelle brillante
interprétation !
<i>Mme Kincaid,</i>
<i>j'ai des questions à vous poser.</i>
<i>Il était en feu.</i>
Allons-y, shérif.
Et les nuances subtiles...
Tu semblais si triste,
après l'avoir tué.
<i>- Restez ici.</i>
<i>- C'est mon mari !</i>
Tu as appelé les types du gaz
pour cette fuite
juste avant l'explosion.
Il ne manquait plus
qu'un gogo.
Un pigeon
qui porterait le chapeau.
<i>Je t'aime.</i>
Ca n'était pas personnel.
Tu te trompes.
C'était très personnel.
Il y a une chose
que je ne comprends pas.
Quoi ?
Qu'est devenue la petite fille
de Corpus Christi ?
<i>Tu as trouvé Shay Ling ?</i>
Je l'ai trouvée.
Au cimetière du comté,
sous une croix en bois.
Une autre victime du Centre.
<i>Pas d'après Lyle et mon père.</i>
Tu as confiance en eux ?
Plutôt qu'en toi ?
Ce serait sortir du feu
pour y replonger, non ?
Tu crois savoir la vérité
sur Lyle et ton père,
sur la mort de ta mère.
Mais en fait,
tu ne sais que ce que le Centre
veut que tu saches.
Qu'attends-tu de moi ?
La même chose que toi.
Un peu de confiance.
Je dois partir.
<i>Sois prudente. Pense</i>
aux paroles de ta mère :
"La confiance te tuera...
<i>ou te délivrera. "</i>
Voilà mon ange.
Ma chérie, tu es splendide.
Allons-y.
Où est Lyle ?
Il nous rejoint là-bas.
Il ne voulait pas perdre de temps
pour offrir à Shay Ling
un vrai enterrement.
Je vais chercher la voiture.
Papa ?
Tu es très beau, ce soir.
Un peu !
<i>La confiance te tuera</i>
<i>ou te délivrera.</i>

NICE FELLOW
Debbie !
- Bonjour, papa.
- Tu as faim ?
On va venir me chercher.
Mange un peu.
Tu t'en es souvenu ?
De quoi ?
Mon anniversaire. Je t'ai dit
que ce que je voulais, c'est...
Un voyage ą Paris.
Et tu sais quoi ?
Je ne peux pas t'y emmener
avant que tu aies 25 ans.
J'aurai essayé !
Je dois partir.
Attends, prends ēa.
- Je t'aime. A ce soir.
- Moi aussi.
A ce soir.
<i>Franēais pour débutants.</i>
Non seulement vous parlez seul,
mais dans une autre langue !
Du franēais.
Comme le fan-club de Jerry Lewis !
C'est bientōt
l'anniversaire de Debbie.
Je veux l'emmener ą Paris.
Vous mangez ēa ?
Ca contient
11 vitamines et minéraux.
Je peux savoir pourquoi
vous źtes lą ?
J'étais dans le coin.
Depuis quand ?
Depuis que le téléphone
est risqué.
N'allez pas au Centre
ce matin,
mais ą l'Annexe des Archives.
Pourquoi ?
Avec le nouveau logiciel
de sécurité,
on a détecté trois transferts
d'informations confidentielles
du Centre ą l'Annexe.
Une fuite !
A chaque transfert,
quelqu'un est entré dans l'Annexe
et a pris les informations.
Jarod ?
Vous avez créé le logiciel.
A vous de le découvrir.
<i>Dis-moi ce que tu as découvert.</i>
<i>Des renforts dans la construction</i>
<i>ici, ici, ici</i>
<i>et ici.</i>
<i>Et le bātiment survivrait</i>
<i>ą un séisme.</i>
<i>Bravo, ēa sauvera des vies.</i>
<i>Oui, mais si jamais les renforts</i>
<i>étaient détruits</i>
<i>par une explosion</i>
<i>ou par sabotage,</i>
tout s'écroulerait.
<i>Le Centre ne permettra jamais</i>
<i>une chose pareille.</i>
<i>J'espčre.</i>
<i>Sinon il pourrait y avoir</i>
<i>des centaines de morts.</i>
<i>UNE BOMBE DETRUIT</i>
<i>LE CONSULA TSERBE DE ROME</i>
<i>Le Centre ne permettra jamais</i>
<i>une chose pareille.</i>
<i>On m'a enlevé ą ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déją</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>ą cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>Il défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous źtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
<i>C'est tout simple.</i>
<i>Essaie, Kenny.</i>
<i>Je n'y arriverai jamais.</i>
<i>Mais si !</i>
<i>Il paraīt</i>
<i>que tu refuses de terminer.</i>
<i>On nous a demandé de venir.</i>
<i>Réfléchis bien.</i>
<i>Jarod, au secours ! Ca fait mal !</i>
Journée chargée ?
Une morgue est plus animée !
Salut, Norman.
Il paraīt qu'il y a eu
3 interceptions de données.
4, ēa s'est reproduit hier soir.
Je me demande ce que quelqu'un
pourrait attendre
de cet endroit !
Des itinéraires de voyage secrets,
des notes de frais ?
Voyons si je peux élucider
le mystčre.
Ca va prendre quelques minutes.
Je vais au petit coin.
Super, ta chemise !
Quelqu'un
vient de se connecter !
Pourquoi ?
<i>Voudriez-vous qu'on fasse</i>
<i>un dīner romantique</i>
<i>et qu'on aille au cinéma ?</i>
Mon Dieu !
<i>Je voudrais</i>
<i>un café et un croissant.</i>
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Un incident
ą l'Annexe des Archives.
Tout le personnel a été décimé.
Broots y était.
On l'a vu s'enfuir.
Une équipe est ą ses trousses.
Une équipe de décontamination ?
Il y a une fuite au Centre.
Quelqu'un a transféré
des données ą une taupe.
Broots pourrait źtre
cette taupe ou le tireur.
Jamais il ne ferait ēa.
On ne sait pas.
Il y a un doute.
On sait qu'on a été trahis.
Cet incident
est de niveau 7.
Ce qui veut dire...
Que Broots est viré.
Vite !
Dieu merci !
Broots, ēa va ?
Non, ēa ne va pas.
Ils ont tué tout le monde !
<i>Et ils ont essayé de me tuer !</i>
Calmez-vous, Broots.
Je ne peux pas !
<i>Votre ligne a été déconnectée.</i>
<i>Veuillez contacter votre agence.</i>
<i>Avec le nouveau logiciel</i>
<i>de sécurité, on a détecté</i>
<i>trois transferts</i>
<i>d'informations confidentielles</i>
<i>du Centre ą l'Annexe.</i>
<i>Il y a une fuite au Centre !</i>
Tout le monde est mort.
Un homme armé a tenté
<i>de me tuer.</i>
Oł źtes-vous ?
Oł est Mlle Parker ?
<i>Elle n'est pas lą.</i>
Du calme. On ne pourra pas
parler longtemps.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
<i>- Vous źtes en danger.</i>
Vos proches et vous, vous źtes
<i>une cible potentielle.</i>
Vous avez peut-źtre vu
quelque chose.
<i>Le niveau 7 a été déclenché.</i>
Rappelez-vous l'entraīnement.
Ne vous fiez ą personne.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Jusqu'ą ce qu'on sache la vérité,
Broots est persona non grata.
Bon sang, Lyle !
Il a une fille ą charge.
On ne peut pas faire ēa !
Je me moque de Broots
et de sa fille.
Debbie, oł tu es ?
Dégage, sale gosse !
Mlle Parker ?
<i>Ne vous fiez ą personne.</i>
Oł est papa ?
C'est mauvais signe.
Mon ordinateur !
Pardon, Debbie.
J'avais promis
de ne jamais m'en servir.
Pitié,
je ne voulais pas le faire !
Faire quoi ?
Ce qui vous pousse
ą vouloir ma mort.
Je suis lą pour vous aider.
Je vous attendais.
On a peu de temps.
Pas le temps.
Faites-moi confiance.
Je ne dois me fier ą personne.
Vous devriez y réfléchir.
Dans la voiture !
Ca va ?
Non, loin de lą !
J'ai vu des gens assassinés.
On a enlevé ma fille,
forcé ma serrure.
On essaie de me tuer.
Ca ne va pas.
Que se passe-t-il ?
On vous a envoyé enquźter
ą l'Annexe.
Comment pouvez-vous en savoir
autant sur le Centre ?
Un ancien opérateur du Centre
travaille avec un complice.
Pour dissimuler leurs activités,
il a tué tout le monde.
Et maintenant,
il est ą vos trousses.
Mais je ne sais rien !
Peu importe.
Ce qui compte,
c'est qu'il le pense.
Moi, je ne compte pas.
Seule ma fille m'inquičte.
Elle est en sūreté.
Je l'ai emmenée chez moi.
Sam veille sur elle.
A l'Annexe,
on a trouvé peu d'indices.
- Et Broots ?
- On le cherche.
On lui a confisqué
son ordinateur.
On va voir si c'est la taupe.
Broots découvrirait
qui est la taupe !
Ca ne marche pas comme ēa.
Que Broots se débrouille
tout seul
jusqu'ą ce que ēa soit réglé.
M. Lyle n'a pas
votre sens de la loyauté.
Broots n'est pas indispensable.
Un singe pourrait faire
son travail.
On dirait que tu as été pondu
sous un rocher, et non pas
que nous sommes du mźme sang.
Navrée de dire ēa,
mais pour moi,
Broots est plus un frčre que toi.
Je ne le jetterai pas
comme un déchet !
J'entends des violons, non ?
Vérifie les faits.
J'ai l'intention
d'aller au fond du problčme
sans sacrifier Broots
au passage.
Jamais je n'aurais imaginé
me retrouver ici avec vous.
Moi non plus. Vous avez faim ?
Ma fille adore ēa.
Ca contient
11 vitamines et minéraux.
Je ne peux pas rester ici.
Mlle Parker a emmené Debbie.
C'est elle qui m'avait envoyé
ą l'Annexe.
Mlle Parker a des défauts.
Mais elle ne vous ferait
jamais ēa.
Sinon, ēa se verrait
dans son coeur, dans ses yeux.
Je comprends.
Le type qui a tiré,
ēa se voyait dans ses yeux.
<i>Jarod, voici Damon.</i>
<i>La Tour lui a demandé</i>
<i>de travailler avec toi.</i>
<i>J'ai beaucoup entendu parler</i>
<i>de toi.</i>
<i>Au secours !</i>
<i>Ca fait mal !</i>
- Vous le connaissez ?
- Oui, je le connais.
Depuis des mois,
j'intercepte des communications
entre Damon
et sa source au Centre.
Cette source
transfčre des informations
ą l'Annexe.
Mais l'Annexe ne stocke
que des informations de routine.
C'est pour ēa
qu'il les fait transférer.
Le manque de sécurité a permis
ą Damon d'infiltrer le systčme.
Mais grāce ą mon logiciel,
on a pu remonter la filičre.
Vous źtes mal tombé.
Damon recouvrait ses traces.
Il a utilisé trois dossiers...
et en a volé un quatričme.
Je ne sais pas lequel.
Il l'utilisera demain ą 17 h.
Mais pourquoi tuer
tous ces gens ?
<i>Nos clients ont apprécié</i>
<i>tes recommandations</i>
<i>de sécurité pour leur avion.</i>
<i>Il y a une chose, Sidney.</i>
<i>C'est peu probable,</i>
<i>mais si l'avion rencontre</i>
<i>une énergie électromagnétique</i>
<i>de trčs haute fréquence,</i>
<i>le pilote perdra le contrōle.</i>
<i>Je préviendrai nos clients</i>
<i>de tes préoccupations.</i>
<i>Tu n'as pas ą t'inquiéter.</i>
<i>Je l'espčre.</i>
Mon Dieu !
Le métro ?
Et le consulat ?
Damon s'est servi
de votre travail pour tuer ?
J'ai besoin de votre aide.
Je dois retourner ą l'Annexe
et découvrir
quel est le 4e dossier.
Il faut arrźter Damon
avant qu'il ne refasse la une.
Je vous aiderai,
mais je dois savoir
oł est Debbie.
L'accčs au Centre m'est interdit.
Pas pour moi.
<i>C'est Broots.</i>
<i>Oł źtes-vous ?</i>
<i>Oł est Debbie ?</i>
Mlle Parker l'a emmenée chez elle
et on veille sur elle.
Vous remercierez Mlle Parker
de ma part.
Je vous passe
<i>quelqu'un.</i>
Damon est de retour.
<i>- Tu en es sūr ?</i>
- Je l'ai vu.
Il a essayé de tuer Broots.
<i>Il a un complice au Centre.</i>
<i>Ils organisent des attentats.</i>
Je sais quand il va frapper,
mais j'ignore comment et oł.
Je vais voir.
<i>Sois prudent, souviens-toi</i>
<i>de quoi Damon est capable.</i>
Je m'en souviens.
Je me souviens de tout.
<i>C'est tout simple.</i>
<i>Essaie, Kenny.</i>
<i>Je n'y arriverai jamais.</i>
<i>On va continuer ą s'entraīner.</i>
<i>Tu fais ēa...</i>
<i>et tu plies.</i>
<i>Jarod, au secours !</i>
<i>Je connais Jarod.</i>
Je sais comment il fonctionne.
Il viendra vers moi.
<i>Ils ne doivent surtout pas</i>
<i>découvrir notre activité.</i>
Je m'en occupe.
Voilą ce que j'appelle
du nettoyage !
C'est l'ordinateur
que Damon a utilisé.
On a 10 minutes.
Vous croyez que ēa suffira ?
C'est moi qui ai créé
le logiciel.
Peut-źtre.
En somme,
on peut aller sur la lune,
mais pas ouvrir
le logiciel de Broots ?
On cherche.
Plus vite !
Oł étais-tu ?
J'étais... occupé.
Tu as l'air frustrée.
Tes singes n'arrivent pas
ą éplucher cette banane.
On fait tous de notre mieux.
Mes hommes n'ont pas trouvé
la fille de Broots.
Tu sais oł elle pourrait źtre ?
A ton avis ?
Mlle Parker ! Quelqu'un
se connecte ą l'Annexe.
D'aprčs le code d'accčs,
il s'agit de...
M. Broots.
Bon sang !
Trouvez l'imbécile
qui garde l'Annexe.
Vite !
J'y suis presque.
Ca ne me regarde pas, mais
que s'est-il passé avec Damon ?
C'est vrai,
ēa ne vous regarde pas.
Je n'ai pas fini.
Continuez.
Pas un geste !
Par lą. Tout doucement,
je veux voir votre arme.
Maintenant, tournez-vous,
doucement.
Tiens, tiens, tiens !
Au moins, je n'ai pas tiré.
La prochaine fois...
mieux vaut mettre
des balles dedans.
Je boirais bien un coup !
Finissons ce qui a failli
nous coūter la vie.
Désolé.
<i>- S'il te plaīt.</i>
<i>- Je refuse.</i>
<i>Tu dois aller jusqu'au bout.</i>
<i>Non, Sidney,</i>
<i>je ne peux pas faire ēa.</i>
<i>L'ennemi essaie d'altérer</i>
<i>génétiquement</i>
<i>la variole</i>
<i>pour transmettre le virus Ebola.</i>
<i>On veut mettre au point</i>
<i>un vaccin pour éviter</i>
<i>un holocauste.</i>
<i>Je ne suis pas ą l'aise</i>
<i>dans ce domaine.</i>
<i>Je ne comprends pas.</i>
<i>Pour trouver le vaccin, je dois</i>
<i>recréer l'organisme mortel.</i>
<i>Concentrations,</i>
<i>toxicité, seuils de solubilité,</i>
<i>demi-vies.</i>
<i>Quelqu'un pourrait utiliser</i>
<i>ces informations pour détruire.</i>
<i>Je ne veux pas de ēa.</i>
C'est Damon.
Il va utiliser votre travail
pour une attaque biologique ?
Demain ą 17 h.
La question est...
qui ?
Du nouveau sur la fuite ?
Avec Broots, j'en saurais plus.
Mais tes singes
ont seulement découvert
que la taupe du Centre
avait organisé une livraison.
- A qui ?
- Ils ne savent pas,
ni oł ni quand.
Dommage qu'il te manque un pouce.
On n'a que l'ordre de livraison.
C'est codé.
Trčs perspicace !
On essaie de le déchiffrer.
Je vous croyais seule.
M. Lyle s'apprźtait ą partir.
C'est fou,
tout ce qu'on sait pas.
Trouve quelque chose
qui nous aide.
Je crois que
vous poussez la rivalité
fraternelle ą l'extrźme.
J'ai du travail.
77...
02 30...
14 98...
1500.
Ca veut dire ?
Je n'en sais rien.
Je n'ai que ēa.
Je m'y mets tout de suite.
<i>Ne laisse pas</i>
ton désir de vengeance
contre Damon te détruire.
Cette fois, je l'arrźterai.
<i>Je sais ce que tu éprouves.</i>
<i>Comment ēa ?</i>
<i>J'étais un Caméléon, avant.</i>
<i>Avant ?</i>
<i>Ils m'ont libéré.</i>
<i>Ils peuvent</i>
<i>en faire autant pour toi.</i>
<i>Je m'en méfie.</i>
<i>Moi aussi.</i>
<i>Termine ta mission</i>
<i>et je te promets</i>
<i>qu'on s'en ira.</i>
Il ne reste que quelques heures.
C'est facile.
Les problčmes simples
sont les plus délicats.
C'est comme les indices
que vous laissez toujours.
- On peut y arriver.
- Il le faut.
Je veux retrouver ma vie.
Je veux retrouver ma fille.
Elle est jolie.
Je ne suis pas
le plus doué au monde,
mais personne d'autre
ne peut źtre son pčre.
Elle me manque.
Rassurez-vous.
Vous la reverrez.
Pourquoi faites-vous ēa ?
Quoi ?
Je passe ma vie ą vous traquer.
C'est mon boulot.
Pourquoi vous m'aidez ?
Parce que...
je vous respecte.
J'espčre źtre un jour un pčre
presque aussi bon que vous.
Pour son anniversaire,
je veux l'emmener en France.
Voyager !
Ce n'est pas un code.
Ce sont des coordonnées de GPS.
Date, heure,
emplacement. Oł et quand
Damon recevra la livraison.
Quand : dans 2 heures.
Oł : un parc prčs de Washington.
Un technicien m'a donné ēa.
Un appel intercepté.
1500.
<i>- Ca veut dire ?</i>
<i>- Je n'en sais rien.</i>
<i>Je n'ai que ēa.</i>
Vous avez aidé Jarod
en me volant des informations !
Je risque ma peau
pour Broots
et vous me trahissez !
Je me trompe ?
Lyle est au courant ?
Pas encore.
Pourquoi je ne lui dirais rien ?
Asseyez-vous.
Peu avant l'évasion de Jarod,
on avait du mal ą le contrōler.
Son humanité croissante créait
un conflit interne.
Contre mon gré,
le Centre
a engagé un dénommé Damon
pour le mater.
J'ignorais que Damon et le Centre
avaient des intentions secrčtes.
Damon a exploité Jarod
et gagné sa confiance.
<i>Ils sont d'accord.</i>
<i>Termine la mission</i>
<i>et tu es libre.</i>
<i>Le virus</i>
<i>que je dois mettre au point</i>
<i>est une boīte de Pandore.</i>
<i>J'ignore qui aura la clé.</i>
<i>Pense ą la liberté.</i>
Jarod est venu
me demander conseil.
J'ai essayé de le rassurer.
Bien sūr, le Centre
lui a toujours refusé sa liberté.
Ca n'était qu'un mensonge.
Une fois de plus, le Centre
exploitait Jarod.
C'était la derničre fois.
Jarod avait sympathisé
avec Kenny,
un gardien du Centre,
innocent comme un enfant.
Jarod le protégeait.
Et Damon le savait.
<i>C'est trčs bien.</i>
<i>Pas vrai, Damon ?</i>
<i>Qu'y a-t-il ?</i>
<i>Tu refuses</i>
<i>de terminer ta mission.</i>
<i>On nous a demandé de venir.</i>
<i>Pour toi.</i>
<i>Je vous conseille</i>
<i>de changer d'avis.</i>
<i>Que faites-vous ?</i>
<i>Faites vite !</i>
<i>Vous źtes fou ?</i>
<i>Il va le tuer.</i>
<i>Et nous aussi.</i>
<i>Termine la mission</i>
<i>et quitte cet endroit.</i>
<i>J'ai déją terminé.</i>
<i>Tout est lą-dessus !</i>
<i>Prenez-la !</i>
<i>Tu appartiens au Centre.</i>
<i>Tu n'y peux rien.</i>
<i>La prochaine fois,</i>
<i>cčde plus vite.</i>
3 semaines aprčs,
Jarod s'est échappé.
Mon Dieu !
Damon a trahi Jarod et confirmé
les doutes de Jarod
sur le Centre.
Et détruit tout espoir
pour Jarod
de reprendre un jour sa liberté.
Damon a été exilé pour vol
d'informations au Centre.
Il recommence. Vous comprenez
pourquoi je fais ēa ?
Broots est le dernier maillon.
Pour qu'il survive,
il faut neutraliser Damon.
Définitivement.
Damon a reēu
une mallette métallique.
La variole ?
Pire.
Il ne s'en tirera pas.
Pas cette fois.
Attendez !
Donne-moi la mallette.
Mon ami !
Que ce soit bien clair :
je ne suis pas ton ami.
Donne-moi la mallette.
Toujours inquiet
pour les innocents ?
Toujours le mźme ?
Jarod,
graine d'espoir de l'humanité !
La mallette !
Jamais tu ne tireras.
Tu veux m'arrźter ?
Tire-moi dans le dos.
Mais tu es trop humain
pour ēa.
Ne bougez pas.
Comme ēa.
Pourquoi faites-vous ēa ?
En me ramenant au Centre,
niveau 7 ou pas,
vous seriez accueilli
ą bras ouverts.
Je crois
qu'il y a un temps pour tout.
J'ai une dette envers vous.
Et en plus, je vous respecte.
Moi ?
Vous aidez les gens,
vous tenez ą eux.
Les autres se détournent,
mais pas vous.
Cette fois, j'ai échoué.
Et vous ne pouvez pas
vous détourner.
Moi non plus.
Etant donné ce qu'on a vécu,
je crois pouvoir
vous demander ēa.
Que s'est-il passé avec Damon ?
Regardez le DSA.
J'ai réfléchi
ą ce que vous avez dit
sur les projets de Damon.
De toute évidence,
c'est politique.
A l'échelle mondiale.
<i>Une messe non confessionnelle</i>
<i>pour la fin du conflit en Bosnie</i>

<i>avant les pourparlers</i>
<i>prévus lundi</i>
<i>ą Washington.</i>
<i>Tu appartiens au Centre,</i>
<i>tu n'y peux rien.</i>
Mon Dieu !
C'est lą qu'il va frapper !
Tout s'éclaire. Les pičces
du puzzle se mettent en place.
Vous savez oł Damon frappera ?
L'avion attend.
Et Lyle ?
Qu'il s'occupe de son cirque.
Il va mettre le virus
dans le vin ?
Tout le monde ne communiera pas.
Mais tout le monde respirera.
C'est Damon !
Un aérosol.
Il va vaporiser.
Evacuez l'endroit.
Excusez-moi.
Il y a une bombe dans le bātiment.
Veuillez tous sortir rapidement
et dans le calme.
C'est plus fort que toi !
Il ne s'agit pas de toi.
Tu te sers de moi
pour empoisonner des gens.
Pourquoi ?
Il faut bien vivre.
Qui t'aide au Centre ?
Toujours la mźme personne.
Laisse tomber !
Sinon tu perds un ami de plus.
Pas cette fois.
Lāche-le.
C'est entre toi et moi.
Ton ami vient avec moi.
Je le lācherai
si on ne me suit pas.
C'est drōle.
Une fois, je t'ai cru.
Tu sais de quoi je suis capable.
C'est fini.
Tu ne tireras pas, Jarod.
Ca se voit dans tes yeux.
Comme quand on était au Centre.
Il a une fille.
Elle a besoin de lui.
Ca ne change rien.
Pour moi, si !
Dame !
Tu m'as manqué !
Toi aussi.
J'ai un cadeau pour toi.
Bon anniversaire.
Sam ? Allons-y.
J'ai des choses ą finir
au Centre.
Tu as bien joué !
Je t'aime, papa !
- C'est Sidney.
<i>- C'est moi.</i>
Ca va ?
Physiquement, oui.
<i>C'est normal de lutter</i>
pour exorciser le passé.
Je n'avais jamais...
appuyé sur la détente.
<i>Pourvu que ēa n'arrive plus.</i>
Ton sentiment de culpabilité
<i>provient d'un conflit</i>
<i>entre ton désir</i>
<i>de vengeance pour Kenny</i>
<i>et la nécessité</i>
de ce que tu as fait.
<i>Je n'arrźte pas de revoir</i>
<i>ce moment dans ma tźte.</i>
<i>Tu as sauvé la vie de Broots</i>
et des milliers d'autres vies.
Je me sens...
tellement vide.
<i>Il faut que tu te pardonnes.</i>
Je connais un vieux dicton :
"Celui qui sauve
ne serait-ce qu'une vie
"sauve le monde entier."
Je dois y aller.

Je ne comprends pas.
Pourquoi ils se frappent ?
S.E.A., Broots.
Stimulus Externe Artificiel.
J'étudie la réaction de jumeaux
face à une agression.
Ils sont carrément
en train de se tabasser !
Vous vouliez quelque chose ?
Oui, vous avez reçu ça.
Ca a l'air important.
"J'ai besoin de vous
immédiatement."

Barker, tu as de la visite !
De la compagnie !
Un type veut te voir.
Avec des chiens.
Vous aimez les chiens ?
Pas autant que vous.
Des rottweilers de Roumanie,
de vraies machines à tuer.
Personne ne leur résiste.
Jack Brevins, votre C.J.
Contrôleur judiciaire !
On devait se voir dans 8 jours.
Je passais dans le coin.
Big Daddy a des vers.
- Comment ça va ?
- Bien.
- Et le boulot ?
- Une partie de plaisir.
C'est marrant.
Vous êtes marrant !
J'y retourne.
Faisons un tour.
C'est pas l'heure de la pause.
Ca fait rien.
Beaucoup de types ont du mal
à se réadapter à la liberté.
Vous avez pris 6 ans ?
- M. Brevins...
- Jack !
J'apprécie votre intérêt
pour moi, Jack,
mais j'ai du boulot.
Je veux pas le perdre
et me retrouver en prison.
Vous savez comment ça marche ?
Vous vous tenez à carreau,
vous obéissez et tout roule.
Vous faites le malin
et vous vous retrouvez
avec un matricule.
On en reparlera.
J'ai lu votre dossier.
Voyez ça comme une avance.
C'est de la bonne,
pas de la merde comme en taule.
Je vous appelle.
Venez, mes chéris.
J'espère que vous êtes seul.
Ne t'en fais pas, pour l'instant.
Vous êtes en forme.
Toi aussi.
C'est du beau travail !
J'essaie de me fondre.
Tu vas me dire
ce que je fais là
ou c'est un de tes jeux ?
Ca n'est pas un jeu.
Surtout pour eux.
<i>Michelle, je suis son père ?</i>
<i>Nicholas</i>
<i>ignore qu'il est ton fils.</i>
Je ne comprends pas.
Qui êtes-vous ? Vous êtes...
On appelle ça "nue" !
J'ai fait des courses.
Vous aimez le sucre ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Sandi, avec un "i".
Comment êtes-vous entrée ?
Le réceptionniste connaît Jack.
Jack Brevins ?
Qui d'autre ?
Il y a du jus
de kiwi et de papaye.
C'est un ami qui m'en a parlé.
C'est délicieusement délicieux !
La vue est géniale !
C'est une scierie.
C'étaient des arbres.
Ca fait presque une forêt.
Jack vous envoie ?
Comme cadeau.
Un paillasson vivant
où il est écrit "Bienvenue".
Sûrement pas !
- Que faites-vous ?
- Je suis crevé.
Si vous me renvoyez,
Jack croira que je vous ai gêné.
Il est méchant
quand on le contrarie.
Jolie femme !
Qui est-ce ?
Ma mère.
Ah bon ? C'est adorable.
J'ai pas vu ma mère
depuis 2 ans.
Pourquoi vous étiez
en prison ?
C'est important ?
J'aime savoir
avec qui je trinque.
Vous avez tué personne, hein ?
Je vous dépose en ville
ou j'appelle un taxi. Choisissez.
Je peux venir avec vous ?
Vous avez des ennuis ?
Ca dépend.
De quoi ?
De vous.
Reprenez du jus de kiwi.
C'est un fruit de la passion.
Je peux vous aider ?
Je suis le Dr Sidney.
On m'a appelé
au sujet du cas Stamatis.
On ne m'a rien dit.
Un employé a dû faire une erreur.
Mlle Roberts,
je viens de loin
et je suis épuisé.
Je peux en parler
à votre supérieur,
il ne tient qu'à vous.
La chambre de M. Stamatis
est là.
Comment va-t-il ?
Il n'a que quelques heures
à vivre,
mais M. et Mme Stamatis
vont plutôt bien.
C'est triste quand ça change.
Enfant, je venais ici.
Il y avait un toboggan immense
qui devait faire 20 mètres.
Comme ce monstre ?
Il était bien plus grand.
C'est que vous étiez haute
comme trois pommes.
Excusez-moi.
Je reviens.
Ne mange pas de sable.
Des copies conformes !
Vous avez raison.
Je peux m'asseoir ?
C'est un lieu public.
Je me demande comment c'est
d'avoir un double,
un lien qui ne se brisera jamais.
Votre famille semble vous manquer.
C'est si évident ?
Certains portent leur vie
dans leurs yeux.
D'autres, sur leur peau.
Quand êtes-vous sorti de prison ?
Ca va faire une semaine.
Bonne chance.
Allez,
maman va préparer le dîner.
Ils ressemblent à leur père.
Pardon ?
<i>Un ancien détenu tué</i>
<i>lors d'un cambriolage</i>
Qui êtes-vous ?
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Je partageais ma cellule
avec votre mari à Mayfield Penn.
Cette photo a été prise
trois jours avant sa libération.
Lupe, je ne veux pas
rouvrir la plaie.
Ca ne fait que quelques semaines
que Bobby est mort.
Bobby avait tout ce qu'il fallait
à sa sortie.
Les enfants, un bon boulot,
moi.
C'est incompréhensible.
Il n'était pas violent.
C'est incompréhensible.
Je suis venu vous aider.
Ecoute-moi bien.
Tu manques un rendez-vous de plus
et je te colle un mandat au cul
sans traîner !
Tu es pas si bête, finalement.
Ce soir, 20 h.
Comment vous traite la liberté
ce matin ?
Il faut s'y faire.
Le monde est plein de surprises.
Comme celle que j'ai trouvée
sous la douche.
Elle vous a pas embêté ?
J'attendais personne, c'est tout.
C'est comme le vélo !
On monte dessus et on...
C'est marrant !
Ce qui est marrant,
c'est que je sors de prison
et que mon contrôleur judiciaire
me fournit de la came
et une fille
qui pourrait être mineure.
Si c'est pour faciliter
ma réinsertion,
ça peut sembler un peu...
précipité, non ?
Je pensais pas que vous prendriez
la dose en une fois.
Quant à la petite blonde,
elle a 22 ans.
Asseyez-vous.
J'aime qu'on soit détendu
dans le boulot.
Et par "boulot",
vous pensez pas à la soudure,
je suppose ?
Jarod Barker.
Arrêté à l'âge de 14 ans
pour vol simple.
6 mois de maison de correction.
3 condamnations pour détention
de drogue et d'armes.
2 condamnations
pour coups et blessures.
Et plusieurs violations
de conditionnelle.
J'ai eu un prix d'orthographe
à 7 ans.
Quelles sont les chances
d'un ancien détenu
avec un passé pareil ?
Zéro.
Vous retrouverez pas votre vie.
Soyez à cette adresse,
ce soir à 22 h.
Encore une chose, Jarod !
Evitez Lupe Harmon.
Vous savez que je l'ai vue ?
C'est mon boulot.
Vous étiez en taule
avec son mari.
Comment il s'appelait ?
Bobby.
C'est affreux.
Vous le connaissiez ?
Evitez sa veuve.
Elle ne vous attirerait
que des ennuis.
C'est vous, le patron !
Tu permets ?
Que fais-tu ici ?
Tu as peut-être besoin d'un ami.
Je me sens bien ici.
Surtout le matin,
quand tout semble encore possible.
Ne t'en fais pas.
Il n'a que 54 ans, Sidney.
Ca n'est pas juste.
Tu as raison.
Comment tu sais
que George est ici ?
Grâce à un vieil ami.
Si tu as besoin de parler,
besoin de soutien, je suis là.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Nicholas le vit très mal.
Il est tellement en colère.
C'est douloureux
de perdre un être cher.
Il ignore toujours
que tu es son vrai père.
Peu importe, maintenant.
Mon mari est mourant.
Tu veux bien prier avec moi ?
Bien sûr.
J'ai commencé la danse à 17 ans.
Danseuse classique ?
C'est ça ! Je me faisais 400 $
par semaine, seins nus.
Vous êtes jamais allé
dans une boîte de strip-tease ?
Des filles nues
qui se trémoussent ?
Des types qui leur glissent
de l'argent dans le string ?
Je m'en souviendrais.
Jack sait qu'on s'est promenés
dans le parc ?
J'ai dû lui en parler.
Vous faites quoi ?
J'essaie de comprendre
pourquoi un type plein d'avenir
gâcherait tout pour 256 $.
Vous connaissiez Bob ?
C'est affreux.
J'ai lu qu'il avait
de jeunes enfants.
Des jumeaux.
De 5 ans.
Il faut que j'y aille.
J'ai dansé
que quelques mois.
Et j'ai jamais...
pour de l'argent.
Ne vous imaginez pas
que je suis comme ça.
Comme quoi ?
Dr Stamatis, je m'appelle Sidney.
Je sais qui vous êtes.
Je me suis souvent répété
cette conversation avec vous.
Sachez que j'ai le plus grand
respect pour vous
et vos relations
avec Michelle et Nicholas.
Vous l'aimez encore ?
Je le vois dans vos yeux.
Merci.
Nicholas ne sait pas
que vous êtes son vrai père.
Vous le lui direz après.
Prenez soin de notre fils,
Sidney.
Promettez-le.
C'est promis.
Pile à l'heure.
Vous avez trouvé facilement ?
Il suffit de donner l'adresse
au chauffeur de taxi !
Voici votre partenaire.
Pat Rush, Jarod Barker.
Tu étais à Mayfield ?
6 ans, 8 mois et 3 jours.
J'y étais.
Je me souviens pas de toi.
Je suis un solitaire.
Quand vous aurez fini
de vous renifler, on bossera !
On m'a parlé d'un coin
d'accès très facile
à Meadowhills.
C'est près du lac.
Des maisons à 500 000 $.
Ca pourrit sur pied.
On n'a plus
qu'à se servir.
Je sais pas.
Comment ?
Je le sens mal.
Fiston,
tu sais pas ce que tu dis.
Jack !
Téléphone !
- Prends un message.
- C'est le Mexicain.
Prenez une bière.
En revenant, je vous parlerai
de Myra et Stanley Bellows.
Ce type est fou à lier.
Il complote des cambriolages
depuis 5 ans.
- Comment tu le sais ?
- Par une connaissance.
Il faut l'arrêter.
Un coup de fil
et il nous coffre !
Préviens les flics
et tu finis comme Harmon.
- Bobby Harmon ?
- C'était pas un accident.
Il devait parler de Brevins
au procureur
et tout lui raconter.
Il prend
des criminels de carrière
pour faire le sale boulot
et si on refuse,
notre peine est doublée.
Sans parler des clébards !
Il adore ces clébards.
Comment il a su que Bobby
allait le balancer ?
Tu as déjà fait un truc
sans qu'il le sache ?
Vous m'avez retrouvé ?
Ton père
a dit que tu viendrais ici.
"Mon père" ? C'est tordant !
Tu auras du mal à l'accepter
et tu as le droit
d'être en colère.
Mais il y avait des raisons.
Pourquoi cacher à quelqu'un
qui il est et d'où il vient ?
Juste avant ta naissance,
je frayais avec des gens,
des gens très dangereux
qui m'ont menacé de mort.
Pour me protéger, ta mère
est partie sans me parler de toi.
Vous m'avez cherché ?
Je ne savais même pas
que tu naîtrais !
Et maintenant, je n'ai ni père,
ni famille ni vie.
C'est faux.
Tu as une mère formidable
et un père qui t'aime.
Ce n'est pas mon père.
Tu te trompes, Nicholas.
Etre père,
c'est plus que donner la vie.
C'est être là, la nuit,
quand l'enfant est malade.
C'est lui apprendre
à faire du vélo, à pêcher...
à nouer sa cravate.
Ce ne sont pas
les grands moments qui comptent.
Ce sont les petits.
Vous avez déjà ressenti ça ?
Autrefois.
Pour un enfant.
Ton père t'aime beaucoup.
Autant que s'il t'avait donné
la vie.
Ne gâche pas ça.
Que faites-vous ici ?
Quand tout sera dit et fait,
peut-être qu'on pourra être amis.
Il y a quelqu'un ?
Il faut les convaincre
que vous plaisantez pas.
Que vous les tuerez
s'ils font pas exactement
ce que vous leur demandez.
Et Bobby Harmon ?
Quoi ?
Je veux pas finir comme lui
parce que vous avez oublié
un truc.
Harmon, c'était une erreur.
Point final.
Ces gens ont combien chez eux ?
Dans les 100 000 $.
Apparemment,
le vieux se méfie des banques.
Assurez-vous
que le courant est coupé
avant d'entrer.
Ca désactive l'éclairage,
l'alarme.
Sinon vous aurez les flics
aux trousses.
Et après, on fait quoi ?
On partage l'argent chez moi.
On s'y met dans 12 h.
Tout le monde est prêt ?
Prêt.
Il faut une patience de saint
pour jardiner.
Vous jardinez ?
Je sais ce qu'est la patience.
J'envoyais une rose rouge
à Bobby chaque vendredi.
Il les mettait devant sa fenêtre.
Il disait que ça lui donnait
une raison de vivre.
Bobby m'écrivait souvent
et ne m'a jamais parlé de vous.
C'est normal.
Je suis arrivé
d'autres choses en tête.
Viens, chéri.
Vos gamins sont chouettes.
Dans le parc, vous avez dit que
vous étiez là pour une raison.
Bobby a été piégé.
Qui lui aurait voulu du mal ?
C'est ce que j'essaie de savoir.
Je suis impolie !
Vous voulez à boire ?
Volontiers.
De l'eau
ou du jus de kiwi.
Oui, kiwi et papaye.
Bobby adorait.
Je dois en avoir 12 bouteilles
au frais !
Journée chargée ?
Je vous avais pas vu !
Je pensais
que vous me surveilliez.
J'ai acheté
des steaks et du vin.
On pourrait manger sur le toit.
Vous connaissiez Bobby Harmon.
Ne me mentez pas.
Je connaissais Bobby.
Pourquoi me l'avoir caché ?
J'avais peur.
Bobby et moi, on était amis.
C'est tout.
Il aimait sa famille.
Vous avez dit à Brevins
que Bobby allait le balancer.
J'en ai parlé à personne, sauf...
Sauf à qui ?
Pat Rush.
Et moi, dans tout ça ?
Jack voulait qu'on soit proches.
J'avais pas le choix !
Je vous ai vue avec un type
à la maison de repos.
- Vous m'avez suivie ?
- C'est un pigeon de plus ?
Ou un ancien client
qui vous a fait pitié ?
C'est mon petit frère.
Il s'appelle Michael.
D'après les médecins,
son état ne s'améliorera pas.
Il pleuvait,
Michael m'avait invitée
au restaurant et au cinéma.
Il adore le cinéma.
J'ai pas vu la voiture
qui a brûlé le feu.
Et votre mère vous parle plus
à cause de ça ?
J'étais sa grande soeur,
je devais veiller sur lui.
Je croyais qu'en payant
les soins de Michael,
elle changerait d'avis.
Les cliniques sont chères.
3 000 $ par mois.
C'est là
que Brevins entre en jeu.
Vous aviez besoin d'argent.
Rien à voir
avec ce qui est arrivé à Bobby.
A sa mort, j'ai eu peur,
je voulais aller à la police.
Mais... Jack a menacé
de faire du mal à Michael.
Je savais pas quoi faire.
Ca va aller.
Je vais m'en occuper.
C'est promis.
Tu es prêt ?
Je coupe le courant,
j'enfonce la porte
et je t'attends.
C'est tout bête.
Exactement.
T'es pas convaincu.
Si ça rate, on est morts.
Alors,
il faut pas rater notre coup.
Réveille-toi !
Je peux toujours t'appeler Jack ?
C'est toi, Barker ? Salaud !
Tu me le paieras !
Je savais
que ça nous péterait à la gueule !
C'est toi, petit ?
Ta vie est en jeu,
prends la bonne décision !
Cassons-nous !
Calme-toi !
Il organise des cambriolages
depuis 5 ans, hein ?
Et alors ?
Ouvre les yeux, crétin !
Il y a plus de fric ici que
dans tous les quartiers chics !
Pas vrai ?
Vous me cambriolez ?
C'est ça ?
Vous me cambriolez ?
Ca fait mal.
Comme ça a dû faire mal
à Bobby Harmon
quand tu l'as tué...
Pourquoi tu parles de Harmon ?
On en finit et on se casse !
Changement de programme, Pat.
Quoi ?
Je suis pas celui
que je prétends être.
J'ai jamais été arrêté.
Toi, tu vas l'être.
Tu seras coffré pour complicité
dans le meurtre de Bobby.
- Bute-le, Pat !
- Tu es qui ?
J'essaie de le découvrir.
Pour toi, c'est fini.
Ca m'étonnerait.
- Tu vas me tuer ?
- Je te le jure.
Vas-y.
Fais-le !
Dégage !
Quel plaisir
de travailler avec toi !
Il reste plus que toi et moi,
Jack.
Tu attends quoi de moi ?
Tu as tué Bobby Harmon ?
Tu vas pourrir en prison.
- Réponds !
- Tu peux crever !
Je vais devoir m'en prendre
à tes amis à quatre pattes.
Tu fais quoi ?
Voyons à quel point tu aimes
ces petits gars.
Je commence par le plus jeune.
Barker, ça va pas ?
Ne touche pas à ce chien !
Fils de pute !
Tu as tué mon chien ?
Tu vas répondre, maintenant ?
Ne touche pas à Big Daddy !
Big Daddy
crèvera si tu me réponds pas.
Touche à ce chien et je te bute !
Comme tu voudras.
Attends, Barker !
D'accord, je l'ai fait !
Je l'ai fait !
Tu as fait quoi ?
Qu'est-ce que tu as fait ?
J'ai tué Bobby Harmon.
J'ai maquillé ça en cambriolage.
Combien il y a eu de cambriolages
avec des types en conditionnelle ?
Combien ?
10 ou 12.
Enlève-moi ce bandeau !
D'accord.
Quoi ?
J'ai entendu mes chiens.
Tu as tiré !
Avec ça ?
Pas mal, non ?
Joyeux Noël, Jack !
Je t'aurai, Barker !
Salaud !
Mme Stamatis, je crois que
le moment des adieux est venu.
Je n'y arriverai pas.
Je peux t'accompagner.
J'ai besoin d'être seule
avec lui.
Mais Nicholas devrait être là.
Il doit lui dire adieu.
Ca va, n'aie pas peur.
Moi, je n'ai pas peur.
Je t'aime... tellement.
Toujours...
C'est injuste.
On a tant à faire,
tant de choses à partager.
On se retrouvera.
Je le sais.
Viens.
Où est Nick ?
Désolé d'arriver si tard.
Je suis là, papa.
Je ne te remercierai jamais assez.
Je suis heureux
de t'avoir réconfortée.
Et maintenant ?
Je vais rentrer chez moi
et essayer de reprendre ma vie.
Une belle vie.
Au revoir, Sidney.
A une prochaine fois.
Je pensais
ne jamais me sentir plus seul
qu'en apprenant
que mon père était mourant.
J'avais tort.
Le temps arrange les choses.
Le temps fait oublier
la perte de sa famille ?
Ca, je ne l'oublierai jamais.
Pas tant que je vivrai.
Mon numéro
à l'université.
Si jamais...
vous avez envie de parler.
Comment je devrai me présenter
à ta secrétaire ?
Dites que vous êtes mon ami.
C'est un bon début.
On ne peut pas demander
plus d'une chance.
Je te dois celle
de connaître mon fils, Jarod.
Tout le monde mérite
d'avoir une famille.
Je ne t'ai pas appris
à nouer ta cravate ?
Si, vous l'avez fait.

<i>Le Centre</i>
<i>Maman, papa...</i>
<i>Je suis heureux de vous revoir.</i>
<i>Mère, père,</i>
<i>c'est si bon de vous revoir.</i>
<i>Je ne sais pas quoi dire.</i>
<i>Cette cravate ne va pas.</i>
<i>Détends-toi.</i>
<i>Je leur dis quoi ?</i>
<i>Ecoute ton coeur</i>
<i>et tout ira bien.</i>
<i>58 990 620 000 $</i>
<i>seront virés sur votre compte.</i>
Combien il a volé ?
60 millions, plus ou moins.
Vu ce qu'il y avait,
Jarod aurait pu prendre plus.
Le meurtre s'explique,
le racket est parfois nécessaire,
mais le vol ?
Prendre pour prendre,
je trouve ça
hautement criminel.
Tu ne digères pas
le vol de ta voiture ?
16 km sur l'odomètre,
trois heures au commissariat,
cinq pages
de constat d'assurance.
C'est trop tard
pour attraper nos joyeux lascars,
mais j'ai trouvé ça
pour toi.
Prends-le
comme un remède préventif.
Avec l'alarme à 2 000 $
qu'on m'avait refourguée,
j'espère encore
la retrouver entière.
Voilà une bonne cible.
Quand vous aurez tâté ça,
vous n'en démordrez plus.
C'est pas une petite commande
que je fais là.
Qui vous fournit ?
D'anciens employeurs...
Je veux soixante SAM.
C'est dans mes cordes.
Expédiez-les chez moi

Vive le commerce des armes !

60 millions de $.
Qu'est-ce que tu mijotes, Jarod ?
En fait,
c'est 58 990 620.
C'est rare d'être dépouillé
au centime près.
Encore une fois,
c'est une décapotable noire
500 SL
immatriculée "LYLE-1".
Elle ne s'est pas envolée.
On l'a trouvée. Merci.
Bonne journée.
Jarod.
La chasse est bonne ?
Jarod a viré l'argent
sur une centaine
de comptes bidon.
Mais je suis sa trace.
Je suis rabat-joie,
mais on a déjà vécu ça.
Quand on aura enfin
remonté la piste,
il aura filé.
Pas cette fois, n'est-ce pas ?
J'ai créé un logiciel
de pistage.
Un code digital
qui marque les fonds du Centre
comme une banque des billets.
Ce programme me permet
de suivre l'argent à la trace.
Je l'appelle le "renifleur".
Hélas, ça ne marche pas
pour les voitures.
Fais un effort !
Trois - zéro.
Mets-y du nerf.
Pardon, M. Blake.
Elle a glissé.
A ton tour.
Elle vous a échappé.
Elle a atteint sa cible.
Les missiles.
Les soixante.
On va vous faire un chèque.
Un chèque ?
C'est pas ce qui était convenu.
Il fallait y penser
avant d'apporter les missiles.
En l'état actuel,
ils sont complètement H.S.
Leur système de guidage
est mort.
Moi seul sais les programmer.
Il fallait y penser
avant que je les apporte.
En liquide.
Viré sur mon compte.
La moitié maintenant,
le reste quand ils voleront.
Ryan ?
Je suis en pleine réunion.
Excusez-moi.
Ryan jouait, papa.
Range-moi cette chemise.
Emma ?
Venez, papa travaille.
Allons déjeuner.
Vos enfants
sont très bien élevés.
Ce sera long,
de programmer mes missiles ?
Il me faut 15 jours.
Vous avez 72 heures.
Il y a 60 missiles.
Il faudrait toute une équipe
pour faire ça en 72 heures.
Je vous donne Logan et Dobbs.
Vous ne saisissez pas...
Je saisis parfaitement.
Vous avez 72 heures.
Prenez la maison d'amis.
Ne bougez pas
avant qu'ils soient programmés.
72 heures ?

doit être chargée
dans chaque missile
l'un après l'autre.
Ce qui signifie qu'il faut
travailler en trois huit
pour tenir le délai.
M. Blake ayant des acheteurs
qui attendent,
on n'a pas le choix.
Je vais prendre l'air.
Commencez, M. Dobbs.
Si tu centres la queue,
comme ça,
il ira bien plus loin.
Merci ! Qui êtes-vous ?
Je travaille pour ton papa.
Le mot "ange"
s'écrit A-N-G ou E-N-G ?
A-N-G.
- Jarod.
- Moi, c'est Rebecca.
Tu écris quoi ?
Une lettre. A ma mère.
J'en écris beaucoup.
Elle n'est pas ici ?
Elle est...
ici, vous voyez ?
<i>Maman, tu me manques</i>
Elle est jolie.
Ne parlez pas à papa
de cette photo.
Je n'ai pas le droit.
C'est promis.
Maman est au paradis.
C'est un ange.
Merci de votre patience.
Quelle journée !
Excusez-moi.
C'est le cinquième de la journée.
Renverser un verre,
c'est pas la fin du monde.
Perdre ses enfants, si.
Que savez-vous d'eux ?
Vous les avez perdus
et vous ne vivez
que pour les retrouver.
Wendy, je m'appelle Jarod.
On m'a parlé de vous...
et de votre histoire.
Je sais que vous avez
des raisons d'être méfiante,
mais j'aimerais vous aider
à les retrouver.
Pourquoi feriez-vous ça ?
Disons que
je sais ce que c'est.
Ca fait trois ans...
Je ne sais pas où ils sont.
Quand le tribunal
m'a accordé la garde,
mon ex-mari a enlevé
Ryan et Rebecca.
J'ai passé des jours et nuits
à les chercher
et je les cherche encore.
Ils peuvent être
au bout du monde.
Je me charge de ça.
Desmond est un monstre.
Quand le juge
m'a accordé la garde,
Desmond était furieux.
Je n'avais jamais vu
tant de haine dans ses yeux.
Vous vous attaquez
à son bien le plus cher.
Il considère nos enfants
comme un bien.
Un vrai papa poule !
Il n'a pas toujours
été comme ça.
Maintenant, il serait prêt à tuer
pour m'éloigner de nos enfants.
Acceptez mon aide.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Quelqu'un pour qui
c'est mal d'arracher les enfants
à l'amour de leur mère.
Maman nous manque.
Elle est morte il y a 3 ans
dans un accident de voiture.
<i>Il y a eu un accident.</i>
<i>L'avion de tes parents...</i>
<i>Il s'est écrasé.</i>
<i>Il n'y a aucun survivant.</i>
Ryan, Rebecca, à la maison !
A la maison !
J'ignore votre marché
avec M. Blake,
mais n'approchez pas ces enfants.
Ils ont de la chance
d'avoir quelqu'un comme vous.
Encore soixante.
J'ai fait au plus vite.
Dites-moi
que mes enfants n'ont rien.
Ils vont bien.
Dieu merci !
Vous me disiez
de venir au plus vite.
J'étais inquiète. Je pensais
attendre plus longtemps.
J'ai dû accélérer les choses.
Desmond ne me laisse
que 72 heures.
Ca suffira ?
Il faudra bien.
Dites-moi que vous êtes sûr
qu'ils vont bien.
Voyez vous-même.
Je l'ai prise hier.
Je n'espérais plus les revoir !
Vous les reverrez.
Ils font du cheval.
Tous les jours à 17 h.
Malheureusement,
Desmond est toujours là,
avec son garde du corps.
Comment va-t-on les sauver ?
Voici un plan du domaine.
Ryan et Rebecca dorment
dans le bâtiment principal.
Je travaille sur le système
de surveillance
pour avoir accès à l'intérieur.
Quand ce sera fait,
nous pourrons agir.
Vous attendrez en voiture
devant ce portail.
Quand ?
Avant que Desmond me démasque.
Bientôt. Très bientôt.
J'espère qu'on fait bien.
J'ai du mal à m'imaginer
avec eux.
Ecoutez votre coeur.
Tout ira bien.
J'ai une chose à vous dire.
Desmond a dit aux petits
que vous étiez morte
dans un accident de voiture.
Je ne me sens pas d'attaque.
Ne me faites pas faux bond.
Ils seront choqués, au début,
mais ils ont besoin de vous.
Ils ont besoin d'une mère.
Faites-moi confiance.
Je dois retourner là-bas.
Vous me remercierez
quand vous aurez vos enfants.
Le Renifleur a réussi !
Entrez, Broots.
J'ai trouvé l'argent.
Jarod l'a viré
sur 506 comptes bidon
et il a atterri...
ici.
Raul Zenega,
promoteur immobilier,
Mexico.
En réalité, M. Zenega
est trafiquant d'armes.
Tu sais ça comment ?
Disons qu'on s'est fréquentés.
A l'époque
où je me faisais un C.V.
Que fait Jarod
avec 60 millions de dollars
d'armement ?
Il faudra le demander
à ton copain Zenega.
Et votre lanceur ?
Dispensé.
Vous me cherchiez ?
Il y a un mois,
ma voiture a été piégée.
Je n'étais pas dedans.
Ces derniers temps,
je me méfie des inconnus.
Je suis passé
devant votre chambre hier.
Vous n'y étiez pas.
Il y a un couvre-feu ?
Ma maison, mes règles.
Je me promenais.
Je suis censé croire ça ?
Je ne suis pas venu
piéger votre voiture,
mais programmer vos missiles,
toucher mon argent
et foutre le camp d'ici.
23 de faits.
Parfait. Encore 37.
- Saloperie !
- Qu'est-ce que c'était ?
Un fusible a sauté.
Je vais le réarmer.
Non, j'y vais.
Ajustez ce boîtier.
Que faites-vous ici ?
J'avais faim.
Je venais chercher un sandwich.
Ce périmètre
est interdit d'accès.
Mon ventre gargouille.
Je n'y peux rien.
Jolie médaille.
Quel saint ?
Je n'en sais rien.
C'est un cadeau.
Je vous demande de partir.
Je n'admets pas
les associés de M. Blake ici.
Dites-moi.
Si les associés de M. Blake
vous posent problème,
pourquoi travailler pour lui ?
Ca ne vous regarde pas.
Ca doit être difficile
de la remplacer.
On ne remplace pas une mère.
Une chose est sûre.
Où qu'elle soit,
elle vous est reconnaissante.
Travaillez ces quadriceps.
Vous devez être Raul Zenega.
Une belle jeune femme
me prend à mon désavantage.
Ne vous levez pas.
On perd la forme ?
Ce que vous voulez,
je vous le donne.
N'importe quoi.
Apparemment, votre dernière
rencontre l'a marqué.
A ma décharge,
ça ne se voit pas.
Mes jambes !
Je vais lâcher.
Cet homme
vous a donné notre argent.
En échange de quoi ?
Des lance-missiles.
Des SAM à guidage laser.
Soixante.
Vous avez vingt secondes.
Qu'en a-t-il fait ?
Tout ce que je sais,
c'est le nom de l'acheteur.
Desmond Blake.
Dites-nous où le trouver
et vous gardez vos genoux.
Je ne vous mentirais pas.
Je vous le jure.
Pas après l'autre fois.
Chienne de gravité.
L'école d'équitation.
Bonne tenue, Ryan.
Continue.
Pas mal, fiston.
Tu fais des progrès.
Où est mon avion ?
Là-bas.
Bonjour, papa.
Comment je suis ?
Redresse ton dos,
lève tes mains.
Ne fais pas cette tête.
Je te dis ça
pour que tu progresses.
Va chercher le break !
J'ai vu une dame.
Maman, je crois.
En voiture, tout le monde.
En voiture !
C'était maman. Je l'ai vue !
Tu n'as pas vu ta mère.
C'est impossible.
Rentrez, tous les deux.
Et s'il a raison ?
Si c'était une erreur ?
Ce n'est peut-être pas elle
qui a eu l'accident !
Elle est peut-être vivante.
<i>Et s'ils n'étaient pas</i>
<i>dans l'avion ?</i>
<i>Le déni est une réaction</i>
<i>très humaine</i>
<i>à une perte aussi terrible.</i>
<i>Mais il faut affronter</i>
<i>la réalité,</i>
<i>aussi douloureuse qu'elle soit.</i>
Qu'est-ce que j'ai dit ?
A la maison,
tous les deux,
immédiatement !
Si maman est vivante,
elle doit nous chercher.
C'était elle !
Elle ressemble à la photo
de Rebecca.
Quelle photo ?
Donne-moi cette photo.
Donne-moi ce cahier !
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi vous me faites ça ?
Vous savez combien c'était dur
de perdre votre mère
et comme ça me déchire
de voir son visage ?
- Si c'était elle...
- Votre mère est morte !
Ca ne sert qu'à me faire
du mal.
Tu as peut-être vu ta mère
parce qu'elle te manque.
Ton coeur
veut tellement la voir
que tes yeux ont suivi.
Faites leurs valises.
On part à l'aube.
Combien de temps ?
Faites les valises !
Avant demain matin ?
Les missiles
ne seront jamais prêts.
Que faisiez-vous
vers les écuries ?
Je venais vous dire
qu'on prenait du retard.
Dobbs et Logan traînent.
Eux, ça va.
C'est vous qui m'inquiétez.
Il est peut-être temps
de vous liquider.
Je sais où sont les puces.
Vous avez besoin de moi.
Si vous voulez vos missiles.
J'ai un cerveau, moi aussi.
Il me dit de me méfier de vous.
Ca ne va pas ?
Je voulais les voir.
Ca me rendait folle
de les savoir si près !
Desmond a pris peur.
Il part demain matin
avec les enfants.
Pour aller où ?
Il ne m'a rien dit.
Il faut agir ce soir.
Garez la voiture
devant le portail à 23 h.
Attendez là, tous feux éteints.
- On peut compter sur Emma ?
- Absolument.
Je vais créer
une sorte de diversion,
puis je ferai sortir les enfants.
D'ici là, ne franchissez pas
cette porte
et ne regardez pas
par la fenêtre.
Les hommes de Desmond
vous cherchent.
Ryan ne m'a pas reconnue.
Bien sûr que si.
Il ne pense qu'à ça.
Rebecca aussi.
Elle avait ça sur elle.
23 heures précises.
Je les ferai sortir.
C'est promis.
<i>Le nom que Zenega vous a donné,</i>
<i>Desmond Blake...</i>
<i>- Je pense l'avoir trouvé.</i>
- Vous pensez ?
Le compte sur lequel Jarod
a volé 60 millions
vient de recevoir
un gros dépôt.
<i>Un virement de 40 millions.</i>
D'où vient-il ?
De l'acheteur de Jarod,
Desmond Blake, au Venezuela.
J'espère que tu as
de l'écran total.
Je dois vous parler.
J'ai peu de temps.
De temps pour quoi ?
Pour que Rebecca et Ryan
retrouvent leur mère.
De quoi parlez-vous ?
Wendy Dawson
est morte il y a trois ans.
C'est ce que Desmond
vous a fait croire.
Mais elle est vivante,
dans un hôtel
à 10 minutes d'ici.
Vous savez quoi ?
Je ne vous crois pas.
Votre médaille,
c'est celle de Sainte Anne.
Wendy vous l'a donnée
quand Ryan est né,
pour vous remercier
de votre dévouement.
Desmond a pu vous le dire.
Elle vous a fait promettre
d'élever ses enfants
en cas de malheur.
Desmond n'a pas pu me le dire.
Il n'était pas là
quand son fils est né.
Mon Dieu !
Mais j'ai vu son cercueil.
Mais pas à l'intérieur.
J'étais en Europe quand
Desmond m'a appris la nouvelle.
Ils avaient divorcé
depuis quelques mois.
Il m'a dit de rentrer
pour les enfants.
Je suis arrivée
la veille de l'enterrement.
Comme Wendy
n'avait pas de famille...
Desmond a voulu l'enterrer ici,
près de ses enfants.
A quel mensonge
j'ai participé ?
Participez à la vérité.
Aidez-moi.
Aidez ces enfants.
Appelez les pompiers
et éteignez ça.
Où sont les enfants ?
Je n'en sais rien.
Le plan a changé.
Sortez de là.
Où sont les enfants ?
Ils sont partis.
Desmond a conduit les enfants
dans un autre bâtiment,
mais ils vont bien.
Parce qu'il m'a vue aux écuries.
<i>J'ai peur pour les enfants.</i>
Il ne leur arrivera rien.
Promis.
Vous ne connaissez pas Desmond.
Il ferait tout
pour les éloigner de moi.
<i>Wendy, calmez-vous.</i>
<i>Allez à l'aéroport</i>
et attendez à l'entrée sud
du hangar.
<i>C'est une bêtise.</i>
On m'a volé à ma mère
dans mon enfance.
<i>J'ai toujours voulu</i>
<i>qu'elle me cherche,</i>
<i>même si c'était dangereux.</i>
<i>Ne renoncez jamais.</i>
Vos enfants
ont besoin de vous.
Je les délivrerai.
Tenez, Dawkins.
Les SAM sont prêts.
Parfait.
Ces 2 jours ont été durs.
C'est dur de s'occuper
d'une famille.
Il y a un problème.
Dawkins est malade.
Qui est-ce ?
Mon chauffeur.
Je peux vous conduire.
C'est la moindre des choses.
Et puis zut !
Cette fois, tu es cuit, Jarod.
Un problème ?
Allons-y.
Emma, ce n'est pas
les deux personnes
qui vous ont interrogée
sur les enfants ?
Si, c'est eux !
Comment ça ?
J'aurais dû vous en parler,
mais je ne voulais pas
vous alarmer.
Ils semblaient s'intéresser
à Ryan
et à Rebecca.
Je ne leur ai rien dit.
On a 2 intrus à l'entrée.
Assurez-vous
qu'ils ne nous suivent pas.
Ensuite, laissez-les filer.
Ils sortiront bien un jour.
J'ai un mauvais pressentiment.
Allons-y, les enfants.
En vitesse !
Ouvrez la porte.
Que faites-vous ?
Je captive mon auditoire.
Desmond, ne m'en veuillez pas.
J'en ai envoyé un
en éclaireur.
Je pensais
m'entraîner
sur une cible.
Quand Logan et Dobbs
seront là, vous serez mort.
La question est : quand.
Vous avez bon goût
en armement.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Pourquoi vous faites ça ?
Pour que vous sachiez
ce que ça fait
de perdre ce qu'on a
de plus cher au monde.
Comme votre ex-femme.
Comme Ryan et Rebecca.
Mes enfants n'ont rien
à voir là-dedans !
Ils ont tout à voir là-dedans.
J'agis pour leur bien !
Vraiment ? En leur disant
que leur mère est morte ?
Elle ne les mérite pas.
Ils sont à moi !
A vous entendre, avoir des enfants
c'est comme posséder
un missile.
Tout bien réfléchi, vous faire
sauter serait trop facile.
J'ai quelque chose
qui vous touchera au coeur.
Emma, amenez les enfants.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Jarod ?
J'ai ici quelqu'un
à qui vous avez beaucoup manqué,
qui vous aime
plus que tout au monde.
N'ayez pas peur.
Ecoutez votre coeur.
Montez dans l'avion.
Les autorités du Venezuela
étaient très intéressées
d'apprendre qu'on trafiquait
des armes sous leur nez.
Enfoiré !
Elles seront là dans 1h.
Au fait,
tout ce temps,
je n'armais pas vos missiles.
Je les désarmais.
Maintenant,
ils sont complètement H.S.
Vous êtes mes enfants !
Vous m'avez rendu la vie.
Chérissez-les.
Et laissez-les vous chérir.
Promis.
Pour vous aider à démarrer,
de la part de Desmond.
De Desmond ?
J'y suis un peu
pour quelque chose.
Bonne chance.
J'espère que vos parents
vous retrouveront...
et que vous ressentirez
ce que je ressens.
<i>Chère maman,</i>
<i>tu me manques plus que jamais.</i>
<i>Je pense à toi chaque jour.</i>
<i>Je me rappelle ton visage</i>
<i>et celui de papa.</i>
<i>Je retiens tout ce que je peux</i>
<i>pour vous reconnaître</i>
<i>quand on se reverra.</i>

NICE FELLOW
<i>Elle était à ton grand-père</i>
<i>quand il était</i>
<i>dans l'infanterie belge.</i>
Elle est belle, Sidney.
Elle l'empêchait de se perdre.
<i>Je suis content que tu l'aies.</i>
Tu as promis
de me lire une histoire.
Je dois y aller.
<i>Merci, Sidney.</i>
Ne m'appelle pas Sidney, mais...
... papa.
Lis-moi une histoire !
"OEufs et jambon,
Sam est mon nom."
C'est quoi ?
Une boussole.
Ca sert à trouver son chemin.
Où en étions-nous ?
C'est ta maman ?
Où est ton papa ?
Reste avec ta mère.
Ce sont des professeurs !
Embarque-le !
<i>Fermeture</i>
<i>des raffineries Binkley</i>
Une marée noire
révélée par un employé
<i>Quatre enseignants ont été enlevés</i>
<i>dans les Appalaches...</i>
Nicholas !
Un oiseau
imprégné de pétrole.
Après l'avoir tué,
Jarod a oublié de le cuire.
Jarod ne tue pas.
Il veut dire quelque chose.
Sauvez les hirondelles ?
Appelez-moi
quand vous aurez trouvé.
C'est triste.
A pleurer.
Jetez-le dans les toilettes.
Michelle ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Ils ont pris Nicholas.
Ils l'ont enlevé.
Qui a enlevé notre fils ?
On ne sait pas trop.
<i>On ne sait pas</i>
<i>s'il est vivant.</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire ?</i>
On le retrouvera.
<i>Posez-vous</i>
<i>dans la prochaine clairière.</i>
<i>Message reçu.</i>
Messieurs, écoutez-moi.
On va partir
de l'endroit de l'enlèvement,
et compter sur la chance.
C'est une région d'arriérés.
On ne connaît pas
les gens du coin,
mais je ne veux pas
d'un 2e Ruby Ridge.
D'où la présence
de Jarod Minor,
qui connaît la région
et ses habitants.
Il nous aidera
à les trouver.
Et à les ramener vivants.
Prenez votre barda
et c'est parti.
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>à cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>Il défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Que faisait Nicholas là-bas ?
De l'alphabétisation,
en bénévole.
Broots,
vous pouvez me remplacer ?
Je ferai de mon mieux.
Et Lyle ?
Je m'occupe d'Eddie Haskel.
Ne faites pas de bêtise.
Ils ont pris mon fils !
Agent Cory, de l'ATF.
Vous avez vu quelque chose ?
Dites-moi
ce que vous avez vu.
Vous n'avez rien vu ?
Vous avez dû voir
quelque chose.
Dites-moi quelque chose.
On a dit
quelque chose de mal ?
Ils n'osent pas nous parler.
Ils ont peur.
Rassurez-les.
C'est quoi, ce truc ?
La signature
de l'Armée de Libération
des Appalaches.
On les a attaqués
il y a 2 mois.
On a confisqué des armes.
Le leader de l'ALA
s'appelle Eldridge Halley.
Cet enlèvement
est un acte de représailles.
Halley est dangereux.
Attentats à la bombe,
incendies d'églises...
Les gens d'ici
devraient nous aider.
Un serpent à sonnettes.
Il sonne avant d'attaquer
ses victimes.
Un avertissement de Halley ?
Ils ne mettront pas
leur famille en danger.
Pas pour nous.
OEufs et jambon,
Sam est mon nom !
N'aie pas peur.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Nicholas me l'a donnée.
Tu sais qui c'est ?
La maman de Nicholas.
Tu sais où il est ?
Un homme l'a emmené.
Lui et les autres.
Dans la montagne.
C'est pour retrouver
ton chemin.
On doit pouvoir
faire quelque chose.
Les recherches sont lancées.
Mais c'est dans une vaste zone
montagneuse que l'ALA détient
votre fils.
Je veux participer
aux recherches.
Je comprends votre inquiétude,
mais en attendant
de localiser les otages,
nous devons être patients.
Désolée de ne pouvoir
vous aider davantage.
Ne t'inquiète pas.
Nous trouverons notre fils.
Tu crois qu'ils vont...
tu sais ?
N'y pense pas.
Tu connais le Flannery ?
Le café près du campus ?
Retournez là-bas.
Je t'y emmènerai.
C'est promis.
Tout le monde
ne s'en sortira pas.
Ceux qui désobéissent
partiront les premiers.
Retournez là-bas
et fermez-la.
Même si parfois
je sens mon pouce,
c'est pratique d'avoir 4 doigts.
La paume prolonge le poignet
de façon fluide.
C'est aérodynamique.
Bien sûr,
tenir une tasse de café
peut être un calvaire.
J'ai trouvé Jarod.
Il travaille...
dans une raffinerie
vers San Juan Capistrano.
Les hirondelles migrent là-bas.
Un chef d'équipe
a reconnu sa photo.
Et Mlle Parker ?
Elle est sortie.
Excusez-moi, M. Lyle.
C'est urgent.
Elle est sortie.
Je vais à Capistrano.
Restez près du téléphone
en cas de besoin.
Je vous appelle bientôt.
Et Lyle ?
Il est parti
en Californie.
Danse, pantin, danse !
Ne me refaites plus mentir.
J'aurais un ulcère.
Essayez le lait de poule.
Il va se rendre compte
qu'on l'a berné.
L'important,
c'est que Sidney sauve son fils.
Je devrais
le chercher moi-même.
D'où partirais-tu ?
J'ai sa photo.
On a pu le voir.
Nous devons être patients.
Je n'ai jamais pu l'aider
dans sa vie.
Il a besoin de moi
et je reste assis là...
Patiemment !
Allons marcher un peu.
Excuse-moi, Michelle.
Je me sens impuissant.
Je connais ça.
Trop bien.
Quand Nicholas est né,
il avait
un problème ventriculaire.
Les médecins m'ont dit
qu'à moins d'agir vite,
il mourrait.
Il n'avait que quelques jours.
Il a subi une opération
à coeur ouvert de 5 h et demie.
J'étais seule
dans la salle d'attente...
essayant de me préparer
à l'éventualité
que mon bébé...
Que mon bébé
me quitte.
Maintenant, ça recommence,
le sentiment
d'avoir à me préparer
à nouveau.
Tu n'aurais pas dû
rester seule.
Il fallait m'appeler.
Je suis sortie de ta vie
parce que le Centre
menaçait de te tuer.
C'était assez dur
d'enterrer mon enfant
alors, l'amour de ma vie...
Je suis content
que tu m'aies appelé.
Moi aussi.
Garez-vous. On a une liaison
satellite avec Halley.
Transmettez immédiatement
au QG.
Ca passe au QG.
On a une liaison satellite
avec les ravisseurs.
Nicholas est vivant, Michelle.
Il est vivant.
<i>A qui de droit,</i>
<i>pour revoir ces soi-disant</i>
<i>enseignants, il faudra virer</i>
<i>un million de dollars</i>
<i>sur un compte étranger.</i>
<i>Notez le code d'accès.</i>
<i>Ces fonds seront considérés</i>
<i>comme une réparation</i>
<i>de votre violation</i>
<i>de nos droits relatifs</i>
<i>aux 1er, 2e et 4e Amendements.</i>
<i>Si je n'ai pas</i>
<i>confirmation de la transaction</i>
<i>à l'aube,</i>
<i>des mesures seront prises.</i>
<i>En voici la preuve.</i>
<i>Dieu bénisse l'Amérique.</i>
C'est mauvais signe, Sidney.
Eldridge Halley a créé l'ALA
en prison.
<i>Il y était</i>
<i>pour homicide volontaire.</i>
A sa sortie, il a tué
au meurtre, au kidnapping.
Que se passe-t-il ?
On ne sait pas si...
<i>Sidney, vous devez croire</i>
<i>qu'il est vivant.</i>
Faites tout pour le ramener.
Pourquoi m'aidez-vous ?
Vous en feriez autant.
On a une triangulation partielle
du signal satellite.
Il se situe à environ 15 km
au sud-ouest.
En plein coeur de la forêt.
Je propose de nous rapprocher
par cette route
et de finir à pied
pour ne pas être repérés.
On a 3 h d'ici l'aube.
En route.
C'est là
qu'ils détiennent mon fils ?
Je ne peux rien dire.
Les plans d'urgence...
Mon fils est peut-être mort.
Je me fiche des plans d'urgence.
Dites-nous où il est !
L'attaché de presse
du gouverneur sur la 2.
- Il veut faire une déclaration.
- Pas maintenant !
Vous comprenez le message ?
Fini de jouer !
Viens, Michelle.
Docteur, où allez-vous ?
<i>Comment trouverez-vous</i>
<i>les ravisseurs ?</i>
<i>J'ai les coordonnées de l'A TF.</i>
<i>C'est déjà ça.</i>
<i>Rendez-moi un service.</i>
Halley réclame
un million de $.
<i>Liquidez mon compte</i>
<i>et virez l'argent</i>
sur le compte en question.
<i>Ca ne suffira pas,</i>
<i>mais il acceptera peut-être.</i>
Non. J'ai une meilleure idée.
<i>Que le Centre règle l'addition.</i>
Il vous a empêché
de connaître Nicholas,
qu'il paie.
Halley tiendra parole ?
Je vais le trouver
et m'en assurer.
Ne l'affrontez pas seul.
<i>Toute ma vie, j'ai regardé</i>
<i>les autres faire leur boulot</i>
<i>sans me soucier des dégâts,</i>
<i>ans protéger ceux</i>
qui avaient besoin de moi.
Pas cette fois.
On doit y aller.
Sidney veut
qu'on reste à l'écart.
Je comprends qu'il ait besoin
de protéger son enfant,
mais s'il se fait tuer ?
Et s'il n'était pas seul ?
Quelqu'un l'aide peut-être.
Jarod.
Pourquoi dites-vous ça ?
Avant de partir,
il tapait sur son clavier.
Un e-mail à Jarod ?
Tirez ça au clair.
Des lampes à kérosène.
Ils sont dans le coin.
Inspectez la zone
et encerclez la mine.
Si vous voyez des hommes,
ne tirez pas.
On risquerait
de tuer des otages.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Halley !
L'argent est viré
sur votre compte !
Je vois un type armé.
Je veux juste les otages !
Ne tirez pas. Les otages
peuvent être derrière.
Martin, Jones,
attrapez-le !
Nicholas !
Baissez-vous.
Ne bougez pas.
- Vous deviez rester caché.
- Il allait mourir.
Protégez le périmètre.
On a des cadavres.
C'est insensé.
Trois hommes de Halley.
Ils ont pris
au moins 6 balles.
Et les otages ?
On a dû les emmener
avant le massacre.
Il est vivant.
Quelque part.
Sidney ?
Comment savez-vous son nom ?
Je l'ai vu à la télé.
C'est le père d'un otage.
Son nom...
m'est resté.
Lieutenant, on tient Halley.
Protégez-moi !
Protégez-moi, docteur !
- Protégez-moi.
- De qui ?
Où est mon fils ?
Il est inconscient.
Réanimez-le
et faites-le parler.
On le trouvera.
Merci d'avoir répondu si vite
à mon message.
Quel message ?
Sidney a envoyé
un e-mail à Jarod.
"Nicholas a été enlevé.
Besoin de toi."
Il l'a envoyé d'ici.
Et alors ?
C'était facile
de l'intercepter.
On a des nouvelles
de Lyle ?
Mon Dieu !
Hier, à son bureau
Willie lui a apporté
un mémo urgent.
Il a dit ce que c'était ?
Non, mais il avait ce regard...
comme s'il avait mangé du lion.
Demande équipe médicale.
3 morts, un blessé. De l'ALA.
c'est une bande rivale.
Mais je ne sais pas
où sont les otages.
On y réfléchit.
Je t'ai déjà vu
avec cet air-là,
quand tu ne trouvais pas
de réponse.
C'est insensé.
Il y a quatre pistes.
Un autre groupe
a piégé l'ALA,
mais a pris les otages
puis tué les ravisseurs.
Les a exécutés.
Sauf Halley.
Il a pris 3 balles,
mais de façon préméditée.
Comme si on voulait
qu'il survive.
Pour qu'il parle.
Pour qu'il me parle.
Je m'en occupe.
Ne bougez pas.
Les secours vont arriver.
Qui a pris les otages ?
Je les avais jamais vus.
Je veux pas les revoir.
Parlez-moi de mon fils.
Il est blessé ?
Répondez-moi !
Vous avez blessé mon fils ?
Je n'ai blessé aucun otage.
Mais il le fera.
Celui qui les a pris.
Il a tué les autres sous mes yeux
et m'a laissé crever.
Il est fou.
Qui est-ce ?
Lyle.
Lyle est dans les Appalaches.
Ici Parker.
Préparez l'avion.
Que vont devenir
Sidney et son fils ?
Pour ramener Jarod,
Lyle serait prêt à tout.
Mais vous comptez faire quoi ?
Ce qu'il faudra.
Cet homme sans pouce,
où a-t-il emmené les otages ?
Vers l'ouest.
Pourquoi Lyle ferait ça ?
Il utilise Nicholas
comme appât.
Pour me capturer.
Alors ?
Vous aviez raison.
Halley a parlé
d'un groupe rival.
Ils sont dans une ferme
à Pine Ridge,
à environ 7 km à l'est.
- Martin ?
- On l'a.
McWood, gardez le prisonnier.
Jarod, avec moi.
Je devrais
garder le prisonnier.
Moi seul ai une formation
médicale, au cas où...
Faites-le parler
et restez en contact avec moi.
Pourquoi as-tu menti
sur les otages ?
Pour ne pas les mettre en danger.
C'est mon combat.
Lyle a tué ton frère,
mais là, il menace mon fils.
C'est donc mon combat.
Nicholas est pris entre deux feux.
Restez à l'écart.
Il faudra me tuer.
Où vous allez ?
Et moi ?
Votre état est stable.
Les secours vont arriver.
Me laissez pas seul !
Quel genre de flic
vous êtes ?
Je ne suis pas de l'ATF.
Je faisais semblant.
Qu'est-il arrivé
à Halley et à ses hommes ?
Rien de dramatique.
On les a attachés,
on a appelé l'ATF.
On va venir les chercher.
Vous êtes du FBI ?
Un truc dans le genre.
Montez au grenier.
On sait jamais.
Nicholas.
Vous me tenez compagnie ?
Pourquoi Lyle
veut t'attirer si loin ?
Cette piste s'arrête
à une maison abandonnée.
Pas d'autre accès.
Il veut que j'arrive
sans pouvoir repartir.
J'attends ça depuis longtemps.
Tu crois que la vengeance
mettra fin à ta peine ?
Il a tué mon frère.
Ca va.
Asseyez-vous ici.
Comment j'en suis arrivé là ?
Toute ma vie,
j'ai travaillé pour une boîte
qui m'a enlevé mon fils.
Et quand mon fils
revient dans ma vie,
elle le kidnappe.
Qu'est-ce que ça fait de moi ?
Qui suis-je ?
Un petit garçon,
un élève de Nicholas,
m'a donné ça pour votre fils.
Il vous ressemble.
Ce petit garçon semblait
adorer Nicholas.
Votre fils
est un homme bien.
Il m'a aussi donné ça.
- C'était à votre père ?
- A son grand-père.
Je voulais lui offrir
un morceau de son passé.
C'est important
de savoir d'où l'on vient.
Qui on est.
Rendez-la-lui.
Je sais tout ce qui t'a manqué
dans ta vie.
Allons-y.
Rien.
Halley a dû mentir à Jarod.
A moins que Jarod
ne nous ait menti...
On fait demi-tour.
Trois gardes.
Trois seulement.
Vous les avez vus
en action.
Les otages doivent être
à l'intérieur.
J'apprécie
tout ce que tu fais.
Je ne te laisserai pas
mourir pour moi. Pardon.
L'équipe d'évacuation
n'est pas arrivée ?
On ne peut pas compter
sur leur ponctualité.
Mais comme dit le proverbe :
"Tout vient à point
à qui sait attendre."
Où avez-vous perdu
votre pouce ?
J'ai fait confiance
à tort.
J'en ai payé le prix.
Vous n'avez même pas
réglé d'acompte.
Tu vas bien ?
Grâce à M. Lyle.
Sans lui, on serait morts.
Vous me flattez.
Vous vous connaissez ?
Phase 1. Rappliquez !
Dormez bien.
Mlle Parker,
qu'est-ce que vous faites là ?
Bonjour, Roy.
Conduisez-nous à Lyle.
Exécution !
Ca va.
Vous êtes sauvés.
Au torrent, discrètement.
Pas un bruit.
Dépêchez-vous.
Fâché, Sidney ?
Vous utilisez Nicholas
pour avoir Jarod.
Une pierre, deux coups.
Tel est pris
qui croyait prendre.
Tant va la cruche à l'eau...
Vous avez menacé la vie
de mon fils !
Menacé ?
Vous n'écoutez pas.
Je l'ai sauvé
des méchants.
C'est M. Lyle
qui m'a sauvé.
C'est un homme bien.
Sauf que c'est un assassin.
Si tu cherches Willie
et les autres,
ils sont un peu pris.
La vengeance.
Ca gomme les différences.
Vas-y.
Pour te donner une raison
de me tuer ?
Tu crois que je n'en ai pas ?
Emmenez Nicholas
au torrent.
Allez rejoindre les autres.
Aidez-les.
Je ne comprends pas.
Votre père vous expliquera.
Il a raison, Nicholas.
Qui c'est ?
Quelqu'un qu'il faut écouter.
Jarod, tu es sûr
de savoir ce que tu fais ?
J'en suis sûr.
Ici Martin...
Lieutenant ?
Un message de Jarod pour vous.
Une chose m'intrigue.
Tu savais
où étaient les ravisseurs ?
Il y a de drôles de couples,
au Centre.
Même des unions consanguines.
Cela va sans dire,
je n'avais pas prévu ça
comme ça.
Moi, j'avais prévu ça.
Dans ma tête.
Chaque jour.
Depuis que tu as tué
mon frère.
Je n'avais rien
contre Kyle.
Tu voulais me tuer.
Kyle s'est interposé.
Je te l'ai dit : on peut faire
de grandes choses ensemble.
L'offre tient toujours.
Tu essaies de m'acheter ?
Je n'essaie pas de t'acheter.
Lyle, tu veux
que ton dernier soupir
soit un mensonge ?
Au centre de la pièce.
Tourne-toi.
Tourne-toi.
A genoux.
A genoux !
C'est ça que tu veux ?
Une exécution sans procès ?
Mon frère n'en a pas eu.
C'était de la légitime défense.
Ca aussi.
Je sais des choses.
Je peux te dire des choses
sur ta famille,
sur toi.
Des choses que personne ne sait.
Si je meurs,
les réponses mourront avec moi.
Laisse-moi partir.
Un hélico du Centre.
C'est bon pour le karma ?
Non.
Prêt...
En joue...
Feu !
Tu as vu Jarod ?
Il est ici !
Il est parti par-là.
Il n'y est plus.
- On le trouvera.
- Un autre jour.
Broots a intercepté
un appel de l'ATF.
Mais il était là !
Qu'est-ce qu'il t'a fait ?
Rien. Je le tenais.
Ces idiots l'ont laissé filer.
Peut-être,
mais c'est l'heure de partir.
On ne peut pas partir.
Quand l'ATF arrivera,
il faudra expliquer
ce qui est arrivé.
Si on ne part pas,
la piste remontera au Centre
et tu sais
ce que ça veut dire.
On peut partir, là ?
Drôle de sens
de la justice, Jarod !
Vous nous avez trouvés !
Monte.
On s'en va, Roy.
"J'en mangerais
dans un bateau...
"J'en mangerais avec un..."
"Râteau" ? C'est bête !
Tu as réussi.
Je voulais te rendre ça.
- Viens lire !
- Pas si vite.
- Je veux te présenter...
- Sidney, l'ami de Nicholas.
Ce n'est pas mon ami.
C'est mon père.
Allons-y.
"J'en mangerai...
"Sous la pluie
"Et dans la nuit
"Et dans le train
"Et en voiture
"Et sur un cocotier
"Ils sont si bons,
vous savez"
"Ils sont si bons,
"je sais."
Très bien, Seth.
<i>Désolé d'avoir dû m'éclipser.</i>
<i>Je ne sais pas</i>
<i>comment te remercier.</i>
Et je suis désolé
<i>de t'avoir frappé.</i>
C'est rien.
Ca m'a remis les idées en place.
<i>Où est Nicholas ?</i>
Avec ses élèves.
Il m'a invité, avec sa mère,
<i>à lui rendre visite.</i>
C'est bien.
Je veux dire : c'est très bien
pour votre famille.
<i>Tu parles d'une famille.</i>
<i>Il me connaît à peine.</i>
Il sait que vous l'aimez.
Vous l'aimez... lui.

NICE FELLOW
Tu connais bien ton père ?
<i>Mieux que tu connais le tien.</i>
Justement, j'y travaille.
Pourquoi m'appeler ?
<i>Tu es proche de ton père.</i>
<i>Mais à quel point ?</i>
Il partage tout avec toi ?
Il te parle
des grands événements de sa vie ?
Je serais folle de croire
qu'on joue à ce petit jeu
pour le plaisir.
<i>Regarde ton courrier.</i>
<i>On a tous beaucoup à apprendre.</i>
Y compris moi.
Au revoir. Je veux être à l'heure
pour mon 1er jour d'école.
Qu'a-t-il dit ?
Bien moins qu'il n'en sait.
C'est la copie d'une lettre
de l'avocat de mon père.
Il modifie son testament.
Mlle Parker, la statisticienne
de Brooksberry Field
affirme avoir vu Jarod
au déjeuner.
Appelez Brooksberry.
Envoyez une équipe locale.
L'ESPRIT CRIMINEL
Le programme d'avant-garde.
L'élite de l'université.
J'essaierai d'être à la hauteur.
Bienvenue aux étudiants
de 3e cycle.
Psychologie des esprits criminels.
Je suis votre professeur,
M. Gardner.
Mais appelez-moi Jarod.
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>à cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>Il défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
- De l'aide !
- Appelez police secours !
Inutile d'appeler.
Je suis poisseux,
mais à part ça, je vais bien.
Les tireurs ? Des étudiants
de théâtre que j'ai engagés.
Et les balles ? A blanc.
Vous avez une raison
de nous terrifier ?
Absolument.
Je suis flic,
vous êtes témoin.
Décrivez le tireur.
- Grand, costume sombre.
- Mais encore ?
Il me faut des détails.
La couleur de ses cheveux ?
- Bruns, tirant sur le roux.
- Blonds.
- Raides.
- Ondulés.
Des signes particuliers ?
Cicatrices ? Barbe ?
Ses chaussures ?
Je n'ai vu que l'arme.
J'ignore s'il avait des pieds !
C'est une situation de tension.
L'adrénaline monte.
Voilà où je veux en venir.
Même les esprits
les plus brillants peuvent
laisser échapper des détails.
Parlez pour vous.
Votre "tueur", Jarod,
était un homme de race blanche,
1m 80, 78 kg.
Il avait
les cheveux bruns et raides,
avec des mèches plus claires.
En dehors des pattes ringardes,
il était rasé de près.
Question vêtements,
c'est là qu'est le crime,
il portait une veste
à revers gris anthracite
qui puait l'administration Bush !
Et commencez
votre chasse à l'homme
par l'Armée du Salut,
parce que même
avec seulement 10 $,
personne ne porterait
des chaussures pareilles !
Très bien, mademoiselle ?
Dunning. Claire.
La première de la classe.
Grady et Matthew
ne sont pas mauvais non plus.
Même avec leurs capacités,
ils auraient du mal à rivaliser
avec une surdouée.
Je serais curieuse de connaître
vos qualifications.
Quelques diplômes encadrés,
quelques dissertations
et on passe pour un génie !
Quelles surprises
nous attendent maintenant ?
Nous allons essayer
de nous immiscer
dans l'esprit d'un criminel.
Ce cours était suspendu
depuis la disparition
du professeur Alden Clark.
Ne serait-il pas audacieux
de résoudre le mystère
de sa disparition ?
Il s'est enfui avec sa maîtresse.
Pas sûr.
Voici le livre
écrit par M. Clark.
<i>Le Crime parfait.</i>
Et si M. Clark
n'était pas parti
avec sa maîtresse ?
Imaginez un peu
qu'il ait été victime...
du crime parfait.
Et si le meurtre était légal ?
Votre piste sur Jarod ?
Fausse alerte.
L'équipe est rentrée bredouille.
Il faut tuer le messager ?
C'est votre 1re idée utilisable
depuis des semaines.
Vous savez qui est avec mon père ?
Un médecin.
J'ai pris l'ascenseur avec lui.
Et il modifie son testament...
Quelque chose ne va pas ?
<i>Disparition d'un professeur</i>
<i>Sa femme enceinte s'interroge</i>
<i>Sa femme a accouché</i>
<i>Elle veut continuer</i>
<i>à chercher son mari</i>
Mme Clark ?
Si c'est pour une facture,
pas la peine.
Même la maison n'est plus à moi.
Je m'appelle Jarod Gardner.
Je remplace votre mari
à l'université.
Désolée. Je voulais passer
pour vider son bureau.
Mais je n'en ai pas encore eu
le courage.
Je comprends.
Ils sont tellement fragiles
et innocents.
Et pourtant, d'un seul regard,
ils peuvent nous aider.
Pourquoi êtes-vous ici ?
Pour vous aider.
Alden et moi, on rêvait
du jour où nos enfants
gambaderaient dans ce jardin.
Ce doit être difficile
d'être la seule
à encore croire en lui.
Ca fait un an.
Je ne pense pas
que mon mari va réapparaître
dans ma vie,
mais j'ai besoin de pouvoir dire
à notre enfant
que son père n'est pas parti
avec sa maîtresse.
Alden et moi avions du mal
à avoir un enfant.
On a beaucoup souffert.
Il voulait tellement cet enfant !
Jamais il n'aurait raté
sa naissance s'il était vivant.
La réalité,
c'est que Clark avait une liaison.
Sa maîtresse lui avait laissé
des messages sur son ordinateur.
Plutôt croustillants !
Et il a vidé son compte
la veille de sa disparition.
Il allait avoir un bébé.
C'est insensé !
Je suis navré
pour sa femme et son fils.
Mais elle doit affronter
la réalité.
Ni cadavre si signe de geste
criminel. Il s'est tiré.
Je comprends votre curiosité,
mais j'ai plein d'affaires
sur les bras.
C'est ma réalité à moi !
Excusez-moi.
Vous voulez commettre
le crime parfait.
Comment vous y prenez-vous ?
Alors ?
Utilisez votre matière grise.
Devenez un tueur, un cas social.
Une personne
sans pitié ni conscience.
C'est malsain.
Il s'agit de M. Clark.
Laissons-le en paix.
On peut beaucoup apprendre
avec ce cas.
Je vous demande de jouer le jeu.
Je jouerai
à ce que vous voudrez, Jarod.
Au risque de copier Claire,
moi aussi.
Moi aussi.
Très bien. Commençons.
Citez-moi tous les moyens
de tuer quelqu'un.
Un coup de couteau.
Par balle. Très bien.
L'asphyxie.
Il y a plein de moyens
de tuer quelqu'un.
Mais il faut se débarrasser
du cadavre.
L'enterrer en forêt.
Trop risqué.
Il arrive qu'un campeur
tombe sur un cadavre.
Il faudrait maquiller ça
en suicide.
Il y a quand même une enquête.
C'est dangereux.
Que feriez-vous ?
Le crime parfait
n'est pas crime.
C'est un accident.
Elle a raison.
Un accident qui colle
avec le quotidien de la victime.
Pour M. Clark,
pourquoi pas la route
vers son chalet ?
Il avait un chalet
où il allait chaque vendredi.
Et il a disparu un vendredi.
<i>Programme d'avant-garde</i>
<i>Le défi du génie</i>
<i>Jarod s'ennuie en ce moment.</i>
<i>Il faut stimuler son esprit.</i>
<i>L'empêcher de devenir oisif.</i>
<i>Sidney, je n'en peux plus.</i>
<i>Toujours les mêmes problèmes !</i>
<i>Que font-ils ?</i>
<i>Ils installent</i>
<i>un nouveau système de sécurité.</i>
<i>Au travail.</i>
<i>J'ai eu votre message.</i>
<i>Alden n'allait pas</i>
au chalet quand il a disparu.
<i>Les étudiants m'ont dit</i>
qu'il y allait chaque vendredi.
<i>Oui, mais c'est le vendredi</i>
<i>où j'ai su que j'étais enceinte.</i>
Je l'ai appelé à la fac,
il a dit qu'il rentrait fêter ça.
C'est la dernière fois
que je lui ai parlé.
La police n'a jamais fouillé
sur la route du chalet ?
<i>Non, jamais.</i>
Vous ne perdez pas de temps,
M. Gardner.
Je suis au courant.
On a eu un appel anonyme.
Le type faisait pisser son chien
et a vu l'épave.
Navré pour Mme Clark.
Ca va de mal en pis pour elle.
Selon elle, il ne venait pas ici
ce jour-là.
Ca ne m'étonne pas,
vu ce qu'on a trouvé
dans la voiture.
Des billets d'avion ?
Mazatlan. Un pour Clark,
l'autre pour Karen Sweet.
Il y avait ça
dans la boîte à gants.
L'autre femme ?
Il y avait aussi
et des bouteilles de bière vides.
En se rendant à son chalet
pour la retrouver,
il aurait bu et perdu
le contrôle du véhicule ?
Ca me paraît clair.
Clark est mort d'un accident.
J'avais encore de l'espoir.
C'est naturel.
Hier, j'aurais tout fait
pour garder cette maison.
Les souvenirs...
Maintenant, j'en ai les moyens,
mais je ne veux plus.
Ne renoncez pas encore.
Je fais de mon mieux,
je vous assure.
Mais les billets d'avion
et les photos ?
Que dois-je croire ?
Croyez ce que vous avez
dans le coeur.
Tu es sûr que ça va, papa ?
A merveille.
C'est fou, comme on s'adapte
aux changements de vie.
Même les plus importants.
Je croyais
que j'aurais peur,
mais franchement,
je me suis réconcilié
avec plein de choses.
Tu vas mourir ?
Je suis au courant
pour le médecin,
ton testament, l'assurance-vie.
Ne me mens pas. Pas pour ça.
Chérie, lis les étiquettes.
Vitamine E, ginseng...
Viagra ?
Je suis amoureux.
J'ai l'impression de renaître.
Quoi ?
Qui est-ce ?
Je lui ai promis de te le dire
en sa présence.
Je ne veux pas
gâcher nos fiançailles.
Papa, c'est de la folie.
Je sais.
J'ai enfin trouvé quelqu'un
qui me rend heureux.
C'est dingue, non ?
Quoi ?
La réapparition de M. Clark.
On parle de lui
et on le trouve le lendemain.
C'est merveilleux de s'étonner,
Grady.
Qu'en dites-vous, Matthew ?
C'est triste.
M. Clark était notre conseiller.
Vous devriez être plus affligés.
Pourquoi ? Cela rend le jeu
encore plus amusant.
Maintenant,
on a des indices à suivre.
C'est moins théorique.
C'est réel.
Bien plus...
dangereux.
Vous savez...
on pourrait se voir,
histoire de réfléchir
en tête-à-tête ?
Attention.
Ne franchissez pas
une ligne fatidique.
Je vais devoir
me contenter de mes amis.
On se verra en cours.
M. Clark disparaît
et vos notes s'effondrent.
Des soucis, Matthew ?
Et vous, Claire ?
Vous vous sentez coupable ?
Apparemment, non.
Ca devient sinistre !
Si le crime était parfait...
Et si je vous disais
qu'il ne l'est pas ?
Si je vous disais que le tueur
a commis une grave erreur ?
Vous vous moquez de nous ?
Le cadavre de M. Clark
a été retrouvé sur la route
menant à son chalet.
Mais ce vendredi-là,
il n'y allait pas.
Il rentrait chez lui.
Il a changé ses habitudes.
Mais le tueur l'ignorait.
Revenons sur les lieux du crime.
Comment simuler un accident ?
Mettre la voiture
dans le fossé ?
Trafiquer les freins ?
Ou... droguer le professeur ?
Pousser la voiture
laisse des traces.
Les freins,
c'est trop évident.
Et la drogue
se voit à l'autopsie.
Pas forcément.
Pas vrai, Matthew ?
Je ne sais pas.
Vous êtes un crack
en biochimie, non ?
Expliquez-nous
ce qu'est le diméthyl-phénol.
Un puissant sédatif.
Comment agit-il
sur le métabolisme ?
Comme l'alcool. Ca laisse
les mêmes traces chimiques.
Une injection
assommerait la victime,
mais en examinant son sang,
on pourrait croire
à quelques bières.
D'accord pour le "comment".
Et le "pourquoi" ?
Le mobile.
Pourquoi vouloir tuer quelqu'un ?
Demain,
on fera un petit jeu de rôles.
Ca nous aidera à découvrir
ce... mobile.
Richard, vous serez le flic
et Gwen, l'autre femme.
Claire sera
l'assassin.
Il faut des complices.
Pourquoi pas...
vous, Grady...
et Matthew ?
Purement théorique, bien sûr.
Après tout, ça n'est qu'un jeu.
Que le jeu commence.
<i>Tu croyais t'en tirer comme ça ?</i>
<i>Parfois, je m'ennuie, Sidney.</i>
<i>Un brillant esprit</i>
<i>livré à l'oisiveté</i>
<i>peut devenir une arme redoutable.</i>
Vous entrez...
ou vous préférez regarder ?
L'expérience est intéressante.
Le rat n'a aucune chance.
Chaque chemin est une impasse.
Ni récompense ni issue.
Ca semble gratuit.
Justement.
Celui qui a le plus gros cerveau
gagne.
C'est ça ?
Ou celle.
Sûrement pas eux.
Leur cerveau minuscule
a du mal à penser.
Ils passent leur temps
à courir après leur queue.
Très cruel, Mlle Dunning.
Je m'étonne qu'un jeu inégal
vous divertisse.
De temps en temps,
les animaux les plus bêtes
sont imprévisibles,
font quelque chose
de surprenant. C'est là
que ça devient drôle.
Jusqu'à ce qu'on soit mordu.
Je n'ai pas encore été mordue.
Le "pas encore" est essentiel.
Tout le monde doit y passer.
La question est :
qui sera le premier ?
Ce qui nous ramène à :
"le plus gros cerveau gagne."
L'esprit supérieur
trouve toujours une issue.
Une petite porte
où est écrit "sortie".
Il est temps
de courir dans sa direction.
Je la mettrai
dans ma boîte à gants.
Comme M. Clark.
Je ne comprends pas, Sidney.
Il n'a pas regardé une femme
depuis la mort de ma mère.
Et soudain,
il décide de la remplacer.
Il ne la remplace pas.
Votre père a longtemps vécu seul.
Son comportement est naturel.
Vous semblez de son côté.
Il ne s'agit pas de ça.
Laissez-le vivre sa vie.
C'est souvent douloureux
quand il y a des enfants.
Je ne suis pas une enfant.
Alors, faites le nécessaire.
M. Clark disait dans son livre
que le mobile jaillit
d'un puits sans fond appelé
psyché humaine.
On a beau creuser,
on n'arrive jamais au fond.
Rendons-lui justice, d'accord ?
Découvrons
pourquoi il a été tué.
Commençons par la police.
Richard, vous êtes flic.
Qu'en pensent-ils ?
Statistiquement, argent
et jalousie arrivent en tête.
Peut-être un vol.
Les 40 000 $ sont restés
dans la voiture.
Alors, la jalousie. Un professeur
qui en voulait à M. Clark.
Ou sa femme, si elle était
au courant de la liaison.
Pourquoi pas la fureur
d'un automobiliste ?
C'est spontané.
Là, c'est prémédité.
On a de la chance,
puisqu'on a les tueurs
parmi nous.
Posons-leur la question.
Pourquoi tuer quelqu'un ?
- Parce qu'on ne l'aime pas.
- Dans ce cas,
il suffit de l'éviter.
Pourquoi le faire tomber
d'un précipice ?
Je ne sais pas.
Pourquoi est-ce qu'on tue ?
Je vous le demande.
Creusez votre puits sans fond
et dites-nous
pourquoi vous tueriez.
Il y a un million de raisons
de tuer. Vengeance,
révolte, libération,
superstition,
paranoïa, dettes,
enfance difficile,
problèmes de coiffure.
Vous oubliez
le mobile le plus pertinent.
L'arrogance.
Voyez-vous, nos tueurs se croient
plus malins que les autres.
Ils croient que c'est un jeu.
D'où la présence de complices.
A quoi bon commettre un meurtre
sans personne avec qui fêter ça ?
Mais l'arrogance
peut causer leur perte.
M. Clark dit dans son livre
que le crime parfait
est commis par une seule personne.
Pourquoi ?
Les complices sont imprévisibles.
Exactement.
On ne peut jamais prévoir
leur réaction.
Prenez nos personnages.
Et si l'un d'eux
craquait sous la pression ?
Et si l'un d'eux
allait à la police
pour proposer un marché ?
Vous n'allez pas
un peu loin, Jarod ?
Rien ne prouve que la mort
de M. Clark
soit autre chose qu'un accident.
Vous n'avez pas parlé
à la police aujourd'hui.
J'ai discuté avec l'inspecteur
chargé de l'affaire.
Il est persuadé
que les photos et l'e-mail
sont bidon,
comme tout ce qui suggère
l'existence
d'une autre femme.
Désormais...
la mort de M. Clark
est reclassée
comme homicide.
L'inspecteur Rusk
pense que l'assassin
est peut-être dans cette classe.
C'est tout pour aujourd'hui.
On se verra... au prochain cours.
Sauf si je vous vois avant.
Allons-y, Claire.
Il faut un laissez-passer
pour entrer ici.
J'apporte un pli.
Pour qui ?
L'inspecteur Rusk.
Je le prends.
C'est sûr ?
C'est entre de bonnes mains.
Super. Merci.
1. Connaître l'agenda de M. Clark
"Vider le compte de Clark.
"Prendre du diméthyl-phénol
au labo."
Et ça continue...
C'est votre écriture.
Rafraîchissez-vous la mémoire.
Ca fait longtemps
que vous avez tué M. Clark.
D'où ça sort ?
D'une enveloppe adressée
au commissariat de Hanover.
Il y avait un petit mot
d'un citoyen bien intentionné.
Claire n'aurait pas...
Jamais elle ne me ferait ça.
Grady non plus.
Ce sont des amis.
Et vous êtes leur pigeon.
Vous voyez ce bébé ?
Il ne saura jamais
qui est son père.
Pas un seul instant.
Jamais.
Et sa mère ?
Elle a vécu un calvaire
pendant des mois,
se demandant
quand il reviendrait,
jusqu'à ce qu'on découvre
son cadavre.
Un soir, on discutait...
on buvait...
On se demandait
comment on pourrait faire.
C'était un jeu.
Ce jour-là, je suis allé en cours
et M. Clark n'était pas là.
Claire a éclaté de rire.
Elle a dit :
"A quoi bon construire
le jouet parfait...
"si on ne joue pas avec ?"
Grady et elle l'ont tué.
Et vous ?
Vous êtes resté là
sans rien faire.
J'avais peur !
J'étais censé faire quoi ?
Claire est ma meilleure amie.
Je ne voulais pas
qu'elle se fâche.
Le jeu est terminé, Matthew.
Il est temps d'agir.
Où est Matthew ?
Sûrement dans le lit
d'un taulard.
S'il parle, on est cuits.
Ne t'en fais pas.
Tant que tu la fermes
et que tu te dégonfles pas,
on ne peut rien contre nous.
Bonjour, Claire.
Grady !
Un problème ?
Matthew Collins est mort.
Il s'est tué.
<i>J'ai tué</i>
<i>M. Clark.</i>
Ils ont cru à mon suicide ?
Ils ont tout avalé.
Que comptez-vous faire ?
Je vais les assassiner.
Parfaitement.
Ca n'aurait pas mieux marché
si on avait prévu ça comme ça.
Mais c'était prévu comme ça !
Matthew est mort.
Il n'était pas à la hauteur.
Son comportement le prouve.
Que faites-vous ?
Je viens pour la fête.
On a perdu un ami.
J'ai apporté sa bière préférée.
Pour qu'on lui rende hommage.
Matthew l'aurait voulu.
Allez-y.
Au plus gros cerveau !
Aux rats
prisonniers du labyrinthe !
Comme Matthew.
Votre plan de secours.
Votre porte de sortie.
Qu'il repose en paix.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Vous pensez que c'est fini ?
C'est le cas, non ?
Bien sûr,
la porte de sortie est ouverte.
Mais où mène-t-elle ?
Moi aussi,
j'ai un plan de secours.
Bonne nuit.
Claire ?
On ne dort pas en classe !
Réveillez-vous !
Je commençais à m'inquiéter.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Donnez-moi ça.
Attention aux empreintes.
Soyez prudente.
La chaise est branlante.
Un faux mouvement et...
Ce n'est pas
ce que j'avais en tête en disant
qu'on devrait se voir seuls.
On n'est pas seuls.
Pas vrai, Grady ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
C'est une plaisanterie ?
Je sais combien
vous êtes sûre de vous, Claire.
Mais vous pensiez vraiment
être la seule à pouvoir
commettre le crime parfait ?
Ca n'est pas drôle.
Libérez-nous.
Un professeur qui s'instruit
grâce à ses élèves a de la chance.
Dans votre cas,
j'ai touché le gros lot.
Surtout grâce à vos erreurs.
Matthew étant l'une d'elles.
A propos, il est vivant.
Le faux suicide
faisait partie de mon plan.
Vous voulez qu'on parle ?
D'accord ! Je parlerai !
Tais-toi !
Jamais un jury
ne nous condamnerait.
S'il y avait un procès.
Mais ça n'est pas le cas.
Je suis seul juge.
Passons les preuves en revue.
D'abord, vous avez oublié
quelque chose d'important.
M. Clark avait une famille.
Il attendait un enfant.
Et sa femme croyait en lui.
Vous, vous n'avez
que vous-mêmes.
Enfin, avant la tragédie.
Laquelle ?
Ne faites pas l'idiote.
Tout est
dans votre lettre d'adieu.
Il est écrit que Grady et vous
avez tué M. Clark.
Mais bouleversé
par la mort de Matthew,
Grady a craqué sous la pression
et a voulu
tout raconter à la police.
C'est pour ça que vous...
l'avez tué.
Avant de vous pendre
parce que
vous vous sentiez coupable.
Les génies
sont tellement fragiles.
Ce n'est pas mon écriture.
Justement, si.
J'ai trouvé vos lettres
dans les dossiers de M. Clark.
Et j'ai décalqué différents mots.
Une lettre d'adieu,
une arme avec vos empreintes.
C'est...
parfait.
Allez au diable.
Après vous.
En fait,
c'est d'abord le tour de Grady.
Le meurtre avant le suicide.
Attendez !
Je dirai ce que vous voulez !
Il ne le fera pas.
L'arme est chargée à blanc.
Vous croyez ?
Mon Dieu, non !
C'est fini !
On est coupables !
On a tué M. Clark !
Pour le plaisir
et parce qu'il refusait
de coucher avec Claire.
Ferme-la !
Ne me tuez pas !
En ce qui me concerne,
vous êtes déjà mort.
Tiens, tiens, tiens !
Je bluffais.
Mais tout ça
a été filmé.
Vos théories
sur le crime parfait ?
Vos prétentions
sur votre côté exceptionnel ?
Vous l'avez tué
car il vous avait rejetée.
Vous n'êtes pas un génie.
Vous êtes très banale.
Je viens faire la paix.
Qui est dans la salle de bains
de mon père ?
Papa ?
Mon Dieu !
Bonjour, Mlle Parker.
Pas Brigitte.
Je suis votre nouvelle maman.
Tu vas épouser la sa...
celle qui a essayé de te tuer ?
Réjouis-toi pour moi, mon ange.
Mon petit chou ?
C'est moi, ton ange, maintenant.
<i>Tu penses bien connaître</i>
<i>ton père ?</i>
Tu viens au mariage ?
<i>Je n'aime pas les mariées</i>
<i>en cuir noir.</i>
Bien qu'il y ait
une certaine ironie là-dedans.
<i>C'est drôle, je ne la vois pas.</i>
Laisse-lui sa chance.
Une chance d'abréger
la vie de mon père ?
<i>L'amour peut changer les gens.</i>
Tu nous manques, Alden.
Un orme de Chine,
son arbre préféré.
C'est magnifique.
Il y en a un
qui veut déjà y grimper !
Vous nous avez tellement donné !
La possibilité d'enterrer Alden,
notre maison.
J'aurais voulu
pouvoir tout vous rendre.
On sait la vérité.
Rien ne comptait davantage
pour Alden.
Merci.
Comment avez-vous su ?
Même quand je doutais...
La vérité
était dans le livre
de votre mari.
Dans la dédicace.
"Pour Chris
"que j'attends de rencontrer
depuis si longtemps."
Bonne chance. Au revoir, Chris.

NICE FELLOW
Jarod doit travailler
ŗ l'universitť
sur des cultures transgťniques.
Tu crois qu'il y est ?
Quelqu'un y est.
- Allez-y.
- Avec plaisir.
Jarod, pas un geste !
On rentre, gťnie.
Je ne suis pas lui !
Pas qui ?
Qui vous cherchez.
Qui Ítes-vous ?
Celui qui arrose les plantes.
Francis.
Connaissez-vous cet homme ?
Jarod ? Oui, c'est le savant
qui travaillait ici.
"Travaillait" ?
Je l'ai dit ŗ l'autre
qui le cherchait :
il est parti.
Quelqu'un d'autre
cherche Jarod ?
Un aveugle.
Le type chinois.
Il disait s'appeler...
M. Lee.
J'ai dťvorť tous les dossiers
sur Jarod.
Ceux que vous m'avez donnťs,
de son enfance au prťsent.
C'est un homme fort intťressant.
J'ai besoin de m'entretenir
avec sept personnes.
Trouvez-moi ces sept personnes,
je vous livrerai Jarod.
<i>On m'a enlevť ŗ ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble dťjŗ</i>
<i>plus douť que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>ŗ cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon ťvasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passť.</i>
<i>C'est un Camťlťon.</i>
<i>Un gťnie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De prťfťrence.</i>
<i>Il dťfend les opprimťs.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous Ítes mťdecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Pour ceux qui voient,
on vaut le coup d'oeil.
Pourquoi donc ?
Une aveugle guidťe
par un aveugle.
Plus de blagues sur les aveugles,
Mlle Newton.
Appelez-moi Rachel.
Je suis M. Lee.
Qui fait la saisie ?
Elle s'appelle Tasha Hon Per Linn.
Anna, pour simplifier.
Ma nouvelle associťe.
Que puis-je pour vous ?
Vous avez connu autrefois
un certain Jarod.
Il m'a aidťe
quand j'ai perdu la vue
aprŤs un attentat terroriste.
Il a aidť beaucoup de victimes.
Il m'a appris ŗ voir...
Pour ainsi dire.
Que voulez-vous savoir de lui ?
J'ai des raisons
de le croire en danger.
Vous pouvez l'aider.
Comment ?
Vous n'Ítes pas sans savoir
que la cťcitť
dťveloppe souvent
une intuition plus fine.
Vous pensez
que j'ai cette intuition ?
Mais bien sŻr.
C'est la raison
de votre prťsence ici.
Racontez-moi
comment Jarod vous a aidťe
et a changť votre vie.
Je l'ai rencontrť en thťrapie,
peu aprŤs l'attentat.
Je me suis sentie attirťe vers lui
immťdiatement.
Il semblait ressentir ma douleur,
mes peurs.
<i>... neuf, dix.</i>
<i>ArrÍtez de compter.</i>
<i>On y est.</i>
<i>Vous devez Ítre dans la chambre.</i>
<i>Il y a 11 pas jusqu'ŗ la porte.</i>
<i>C'est trŤs bien.</i>
<i>Il fait beau.</i>
<i>Si on sortait ?</i>
<i>Je crois que je prťfŤre</i>
<i>rester ici.</i>
<i>Vous devrez sortir un jour.</i>
<i>Je devais travailler au studio,</i>
<i>mais comme il faisait beau,</i>
<i>je suis montťe</i>
<i>sur le toit de la mairie.</i>
<i>C'est la derniŤre fois</i>
<i>que je suis sortie.</i>
<i>Vous ťtiez au mauvais endroit</i>
<i>au mauvais moment.</i>
<i>Ce n'est pas votre faute.</i>
<i>Vous devez continuer ŗ vivre.</i>
<i>Dans l'objectif, je voyais</i>
<i>des choses que nul ne voyait.</i>
<i>Je me rappelle</i>
<i>chaque photo en dťtail.</i>
<i>C'est ironique.</i>
<i>On dit qu'il ťtait lŗ,</i>
<i>ce jour-lŗ.</i>
<i>J'ai dŻ voir l'homme</i>
<i>qui a posť la bombe.</i>
<i>Mais j'ai beau essayer,</i>
<i>je ne me souviens pas.</i>
Vous voulez dire
que Jarod avait un lien
affectif avec vous ?
C'ťtait plus que Áa.
Il ťtait presque devenu moi.
Il semblait me comprendre,
me connaÓtre,
mieux que moi-mÍme.
Il m'a aidťe ŗ accepter ma vie
de faÁon magique.
Comme un artiste
peignant une toile,
sauf que Jarod ťtait le peintre
et moi, la toile.
<i>C'est une nouvelle thťrapie ?</i>
<i>Appelez Áa une simulation.</i>
<i>Je vais crťer un environnement</i>
<i>avec les stimuli vous permettant</i>
<i>de recrťer un ťvťnement...</i>
<i>et de devenir quelqu'un.</i>
<i>Qui dois-je devenir ?</i>
<i>Vous-mÍme.</i>
<i>Mon appareil photo !</i>
<i>Je n'y ai pas touchť depuis...</i>
<i>Depuis ce jour ŗ la mairie.</i>
<i>Je veux que vous dťveloppiez</i>
<i>cette pellicule,</i>
<i>les photos que vous avez prises</i>
<i>ce jour-lŗ.</i>
<i>Il n'est pas chargť.</i>
<i>Je sais.</i>
<i>Dťveloppez ces photos</i>
<i>dans votre esprit.</i>
<i>Je suis sur le toit de la mairie.</i>
<i>La lumiŤre naturelle</i>
<i>est parfaite.</i>
<i>Le b‚timent est...</i>
<i>fermť. C'est dimanche.</i>
<i>Je prends mes derniŤres photos</i>
<i>pour mon vernissage.</i>
<i>Etes-vous seule ?</i>
<i>Je crois.</i>
<i>Je ne vois personne.</i>
<i>Je ne vois personne,</i>
<i>mais je sens...</i>
<i>un picotement dans la nuque.</i>
<i>Continuez.</i>
<i>Je ne vois personne,</i>
<i>mais j'entends un bruit.</i>
<i>Qu'entendez-vous ?</i>
<i>Des pas...</i>
<i>qui s'ťloignent rapidement.</i>
<i>C'est juste avant l'attentat.</i>
<i>Rachel, voyez-vous la bombe ?</i>
<i>C'est juste avant le flash.</i>
<i>Le voyez-vous ?</i>
<i>Non, mais je sens quelque chose.</i>
<i>Vous le sentez.</i>
<i>C'est sŻrement Alan.</i>
<i>C'est son parfum.</i>
Avec ce qu'il a trouvť
dans mon esprit,
Jarod a pu attraper
le terroriste
et me donner le courage
de reprendre confiance en moi.
C'est fort intťressant.
Anna ?
Merci pour tout.
Mon assistante, Anna,
va vous raccompagner.
Vous aviez raison
pour l'intuition.
Vous voulez capturer Jarod.
Vous n'y arriverez pas.
Il est trop intelligent,
mÍme pour vous.
Qui est M. Lee ?
Qu'est-ce qu'un Chinois aveugle
veut de Jarod ?
La mÍme chose que tout le monde :
un avantage.
Jarod est un atout.
Qui veut le rťcupťrer ?
Tout cela est absurde.
Allez au dernier repaire
de Jarod.
Demandez autour de vous
si on a vu M. Lee.
Je suis trŤs intriguť
par notre ami aveugle.
Tiens Brigitte au courant,
c'est mon agent de liaison.
Depuis quand ai-je besoin
d'un agent de liaison ?
Depuis qu'un autre
cherche Jarod.
Mais rassurez-vous, mon ange.
Attraper un aveugle,
c'est pas sorcier.
Il suffit d'ouvrir les yeux.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Vous avez de la visite.
Le Ginsu offre des nems ?
"Ginsu", c'est japonais.
Un homme si ťrudit,
un universitaire,
un mťdecin...
La prison a dŻ vous rapprocher
du commun des mortels.
C'ťtait peut-Ítre voulu.
Dr Fine,
vous pouvez m'appeler...
M. Lee.
Eh bien, M. Lee,
j'ignore de quoi il s'agit...
D'une de vos connaissances,
que je recherche.
Il s'appelle Jarod.
Vous plaisantez ?
Ca fait 18 mois que j'essaie
de parler de Jarod.
Il a disparu,
comme s'il n'avait jamais existť.
Vous semblez frustrť.
A cause de ce dingue,
je vais passer ma vie
dans une cellule de 6 m2.
Oui, je suis frustrť !
Vous avez enterrť vivant
un homme innocent.
Oý voulez-vous en venir ?
A Jarod.
A sa faÁon, il n'a fait
que vous dťnoncer au monde.
La justice des uns
est la vengeance des autres.
Ca me fait une belle jambe.
Aimeriez-vous voir Jarod
dans un cadre pire
que celui-ci ?
Vous pouvez faire Áa ?
Si vous me dites
ce qu'il vous a fait.
Ce qu'il a fait ?
Il a essayť de me tuer,
de m'enterrer vivant.
<i>- Blague ou bonbon ?</i>
<i>- Quelle peur !</i>
<i>AprŤs tout, c'est bien lŗ</i>
<i>le sens de cette fÍte.</i>
<i>N'est-ce pas ?</i>
<i>Vous arrivez trop tard.</i>
<i>Il n'est plus lŗ.</i>
<i>- Qui Áa ?</i>
<i>- Enrique.</i>
<i>Vous l'avez tuť.</i>
<i>- Quelle macabre plaisanterie...</i>
<i>- Ce n'est pas une plaisanterie.</i>
<i>C'est une leÁon de vie.</i>
<i>Dans certaines cultures,</i>
<i>l'esprit d'un homme tuť violemment</i>
<i>revient se venger de son assassin.</i>
<i>Flippant, non ?</i>
<i>Ne partez pas, Dr Fine.</i>
<i>C'est le jour des morts</i>
<i>et vous Ítes</i>
<i>l'invitť d'honneur.</i>
<i>Ce n'est pas drŰle !</i>
<i>Je sais, ce serait affreux</i>
<i>d'Ítre enterrť vivant.</i>
<i>Surtout avec Áa au pied.</i>
<i>Ne rťveillez pas les morts.</i>
<i>Vous les rejoindrez bientŰt.</i>
<i>Enrique avait dťcouvert</i>
<i>que vous aviez tuť un cobaye ?</i>
<i>Vous Ítes fou !</i>
<i>On ne dit pas Áa</i>
<i>ŗ un homme muni d'une pelle.</i>
<i>Vous avez transformť un sans-abri</i>
<i>en cobaye humain</i>
<i>pour tester vos mťdicaments.</i>
<i>En cas d'ťchec,</i>
<i>personne ne le rťclamerait.</i>
<i>Ce fut un ťchec, n'est-ce pas ?</i>
<i>Et quelqu'un l'a rťclamť :</i>
<i>Enrique.</i>
<i>Vous l'avez enterrť vivant</i>
<i>pour protťger vos recherches.</i>
<i>Oui ! Laissez-moi sortir !</i>
<i>En criant,</i>
<i>vous gaspillez de l'oxygŤne.</i>
<i>Et croyez-moi,</i>
<i>vous allez en avoir besoin !</i>
<i>Joyeux Halloween !</i>
J'imagine.
C'est peut-Ítre sa maniŤre
de rendre la justice affective.
En quoi Áa peut vous aider ?
Vous m'avez beaucoup aidť.
Vous m'avez dit qui il est
et ce qu'il est.
Je l'attraperai.
M. Lee ŗ l'appareil.
AprŤs mes premiers entretiens,
je trouve Jarod
encore plus stimulant
que je n'imaginais.
<i>Jarod, je n'y arriverai jamais.</i>
<i>Mais si, avec de l'entraÓnement.</i>
Son dťsir d'aider autrui
et sa soif de justice
sont inťbranlables.
Mais c'est aussi
ce qui le perdra.
Jarod est un homme
plein de compassion.
C'est presque une seconde nature.
C'est-ŗ-dire ?
Sa faÁon de communiquer
avec les autres, avec leur ‚me,
est unique chez lui.
C'est assez ironique.
Ironique ?
Il peut Ítre si prťsent
pour les autres
et pourtant, au fond de lui,
il est si seul.
Je n'oublierai jamais
notre premiŤre rencontre.
<i>Mme Morgan,</i>
<i>nous avons trouvť votre fille.</i>
<i>Si tout va bien,</i>
<i>Catherine sera dans vos bras</i>
<i>demain soir.</i>
<i>Dieu vous bťnisse aussi.</i>
<i>Que puis-je pour vous ?</i>
<i>Je ne sais pas qui je suis.</i>
En regardant dans ses yeux,
j'ai vu sa souffrance,
sa tristesse.
Ainsi, Jarod est venu
vous demander de l'aide ?
C'est mon travail.
Je rťunis les familles,
j'aide les gens
ŗ retrouver leur passť
pour qu'ils aient un avenir.
Je croyais avoir tout vu,
avant d'entendre Jarod.
Je cherche mes parents.
Ils sont en vie ?
Je n'en sais rien.
<i>On ne m'a jamais dit la vťritť.</i>
<i>Consultez le fichier de la police.</i>
<i>Je ne peux pas.</i>
<i>C'est dur ŗ comprendre,</i>
<i>mais j'ai peu de temps.</i>
<i>72 heures.</i>
<i>Sans nom...</i>
<i>J'ai une photo.</i>
<i>Ma mŤre.</i>
<i>Du moins, ŗ ce qu'on m'a dit.</i>
<i>Je ferai mon possible.</i>
<i>Merci.</i>
Ainsi, vous avez pu
donner ŗ Jarod
l'identitť de sa mŤre ?
Non. Des gens ont volť
les donnťes
et les ont dťtruites
avant que Jarod ne les voie.
Ca a dŻ lui saper le moral.
En fait, Áa l'a incitť
ŗ aider des personnes
dans son cas.
En 3 ans, il m'a aidťe
ŗ retrouver et ŗ rendre 9 enfants
ŗ leurs familles.
Chaque fois,
il refuse toute rťcompense.
Son ‚me sait endurer.
Je n'ai jamais vu personne
douť d'autant de compassion.
Vous aviez raison.
C'ťtait facile
de retrouver M. Lee.
Personne n'a vu
de Chinois aveugle
depuis Kung Fu.
Bravo, tÍte de linotte.
M. Lee a une sale rťputation
jusqu'ŗ Hong-Kong.
Il trouve les gens et les fait
disparaÓtre... en morceaux.
Si on joue bien,
on le rťcupťrera entier.
Allons-y.
En position.
C'est plus difficile que prťvu.
Je dťcouvre que Jarod
est trŤs complexe,
trŤs yin et yang.
Dangereux mais sŻr de lui.
Plein de souffrance,
mais capable de soigner autrui.
Il est capable de rendre justice
contre les puissants,
tout en ayant pitiť des faibles.
Il aide les ťgarťs ŗ se retrouver,
mais ne peut dťcouvrir
sa vraie nature.
Ironique, n'est-ce pas ?
On a de la visite.
Il faut y aller.
Patience, les gardes
ne sont pas encore en position.
Lee ne sait pas qu'on est lŗ.
Tu vas tout faire rater.
Je sais ce que je fais.
On va entrer
et attraper l'aveugle.
Prends-en de la graine.
Imbťcile !
On est repťrťs.
- C'est un mur.
- Et Áa, une location.
Il ťtait lŗ !
Belle dťmonstration !
Dehors !
Il n'a pas pu prendre la voiture.
M. Lee est comme un chaman.
Qu'est-ce que vous dites ?
On ne peut le voir ni le toucher.
Rťveille-toi, Kato.
Du braille. Super.
- Si vous avez oubliť...
- C'est quoi ?
Des noms de personnes
liťes ŗ Jarod.
Lee les a interrogťes.
- D'oý les connaÓt-il ?
- Du Centre.
Identifiez les appels
entrants et sortants.
On saura
pour qui travaille M. Lee.
Vous avez une idťe ?
En tout cas,
ce sont des gens particuliers.
Chouettes chaussures.
Merci beaucoup.
Vous portez toujours
cet accoutrement ?
Je vois que vous n'apprťciez pas
le poids de ma responsabilitť.
Veuillez excuser M. Lyle.
Il n'est pas fan.
Moi si, Bernie.
Et j'apprťcie le temps
que vous nous accordez.
J'ai toujours du temps,
pour une jolie fille.
Qu'est-ce que M. Lee
voulait savoir sur Jarod ?
Mes sentiments pour lui.
Minute aprŤs minute,
depuis l'instant
de notre rencontre.
<i>Venez me voir ce soir.</i>
<i>Pas de chiquť,</i>
<i>pas de "hors-d'oeuvre"gratuit.</i>
<i>A tout ŗ l'heure.</i>
<i>Alors, Nounours,</i>
<i>on vient fricoter avec le King ?</i>
<i>J'essaie de comprendre.</i>
<i>Vous vous faites passer</i>
<i>pour un chanteur mort ?</i>
<i>Un chanteur !</i>
<i>Vous savez pas qui je suis ?</i>
<i>En fait...</i>
<i>Je suis un monument.</i>
<i>Le Mont Rushmore en paillettes.</i>
<i>Personne sur cette planŤte</i>
<i>n'a jamais manquť de respect</i>
<i>ŗ l'homme que vous regardez.</i>
<i>Un type te donne 5 $</i>
<i>pour peloter sa femme.</i>
<i>J'arrive.</i>
<i>Mes fans commandent.</i>
<i>Je dois y aller.</i>
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>
J'avais mal compris Jarod,
au dťbut.
Comment Áa ?
Comme j'ai dit ŗ M. Lee,
Jarod est la seule personne
qui s'inquiťtait
de ce que j'endurais.
<i>Bienvenue ŗ l'hŰtel des pleurs.</i>
<i>Vous devriez Ítre en scŤne.</i>
<i>La scŤne, c'est fini pour le King.</i>
<i>Le casino m'a virť.</i>
<i>A cause de cette histoire de fil ?</i>
<i>Quel fil ?</i>
<i>La pelote.</i>
<i>Il paraÓt que la revue</i>
<i>ne plaisait plus.</i>
<i>J'ai pris 15 kg.</i>
<i>Vous croyez que c'est facile ?</i>
<i>Je dirais que non.</i>
<i>Bonne rťponse !</i>
<i>J'ai tout sacrifiť.</i>
<i>Par amour.</i>
<i>Pour faire plaisir au public.</i>
<i>Si les patrons du casino</i>
<i>se mettaient ŗ ma place</i>
<i>rien qu'une heure,</i>
<i>ils chanteraient un autre refrain,</i>
<i>je vous jure !</i>
<i>Vous ne pouvez pas</i>
<i>travailler ailleurs ?</i>
<i>Non, mon coco.</i>
<i>AprŤs 24 ans</i>
<i>ŗ faire sourire les gens,</i>
<i>ŗ chanter</i>
<i>et ŗ faire passer</i>
<i>les bonnes vibrations,</i>
<i>c'est la fin du King.</i>
<i>Mais on s'est bien marrť !</i>
<i>J'en suis sŻr.</i>
<i>Excusez-moi. Je me dťballe</i>
<i>et je sais mÍme pas votre nom.</i>
<i>Jarod Felson.</i>
<i>Bernie Baxley.</i>
<i>Enchantť, Bernie Baxley.</i>
<i>J'ai peur.</i>
<i>De quoi ?</i>
<i>De lui.</i>
Jarod m'a aidť
ŗ vaincre mes peurs,
ŗ me retrouver.
J'avoue
qu'il a un peu dťteint sur moi,
mais je crois que j'ai un peu
dťteint sur lui aussi.
AprŤs, j'ai quittť Las Vegas.
Sans regret.
Gr‚ce ŗ Jarod,
j'ai fait mon trou ŗ Branson,
oý j'entretiens la mťmoire du King
363 jours par an.
Je ferme au nouvel an
et pour l'anniversaire du King.
Je me suis blessť
en dansant il y a un an.
Mais Jarod dit
qu'il faut s'adapter...
continuer ŗ chercher
d'autres faÁons
d'avancer et de s'ťclater.
Alors j'ai ťtendu
mon rťpertoire.
Je pensais vous donner
un aperÁu de mon numťro.
Mesdames, messieurs,
veuillez applaudir...
Mini King !
Dis quelque chose
ŗ la jolie dame.
Vous Ítes meilleure
que le beurre d'arachide
et le sandwich ŗ la banane.
Merci beaucoup.
Faites-le sortir
avant que je l'aplatisse.
C'est l'heure de partir.
Quand faut y aller...
Vous disiez
que ces gens devaient Ítre
particuliers.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Lee a interrogť
toutes ces personnes
sur leur lien affectif avec Jarod
pour anticiper...
son prochain coup.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Le dernier appel de Lee
ťtait pour le Centre.
Devinez oý.
Accouchez.
Le bureau de votre pŤre.
Le prochain sujet
rechignera peut-Ítre ŗ coopťrer.
Je m'en charge.
La violence ne figurait pas
sur votre C V.
Je le mettrai ŗ jour.
Un problŤme ?
Oui. La batterie doit Ítre ŗ plat.
Je peux vous aider.
Ca ne vous ennuie pas ?
Je ne suis pas garagiste,
mais j'ai les mains agiles.
M. Lee !
Vous connaissez
mon assistante, Anna.
Si je la connais ?
Elle m'a kidnappť.
Vraiment ?
Asseyez-vous.
Je n'en ai pas envie.
Excusez ma prťcipitation,
mais je dois
connaÓtre votre relation
avec Jarod.
Et moi, j'aimerais connaÓtre
votre relation avec Jarod.
Dans la vie,
il est primordial de connaÓtre
sa position.
Et vous, monsieur,
n'Ítes pas en position
de poser des questions.
Je ne sais pas
ce que vous trafiquez,
mais vous avez besoin
d'une leÁon.
Navrť. Je vous ai fait mal ?
On ne voit pas seulement
avec les yeux.
Je vais vous aider.
Encore une fois, asseyez-vous.
Et parlez-moi.
Que voulez-vous savoir ?
Ce qui motive Jarod,
pourquoi il prend des risques
pour aider autrui.
Pourquoi il fuit,
mais ne disparaÓt pas.
Pourquoi je vous aiderais ?
Parce que vous avez
une relation particuliŤre
avec Jarod.
Vous avez tentť
de le tuer, n'est-ce pas ?
Dans l'intťrÍt de la science.
<i>Dťgagez !</i>
L'idťe n'ťtait pas de moi.
Vous avez ťgalement
kidnappť Jarod ?
A situation dťsespťrťe,
mesures dťsespťrťes.
"A situation dťsespťrťe,
mesures dťsespťrťes."
Non content
d'avoir kidnappť Jarod,
vous avez aussi tirť sur son frŤre
et vous l'avez tuť.
C'ťtait un accident
pur et simple.
<i>Charmant !</i>
<i>Heureux en famille ?</i>
<i>Tu es cuit, Lyle.</i>
<i>Tu n'as plus d'issue.</i>
<i>Tu me connais mieux que Áa, Jarod.</i>
<i>L‚che Áa, petit.</i>
<i>- Tire, crťtin !</i>
<i>- La ferme !</i>
<i>Bouge pas,</i>
<i>ou je troue ton grand frŤre.</i>
<i>Des menaces.</i>
<i>C'est tout ce que tu nous donnes.</i>
<i>Tu as volť notre vie,</i>
<i>dťtruit notre esprit</i>
<i>et tu veux nous tuer ?</i>
<i>On s'en fout, Lyle.</i>
<i>Ca ne changera rien.</i>
<i>Je vais le tuer.</i>
<i>Je vais le faire.</i>
<i>Alors je te tuerai.</i>
<i>Ne fais pas Áa.</i>
Un autre aspect
de la motivation de Jarod
m'ťchappe.
A savoir ?
Pourquoi, aprŤs
ce que vous lui avez fait,
ne vous a-t-il pas tuť ?
AprŤs tout,
il est plus fort
et plus intelligent que vous.
Peut-Ítre qu'il m'aime.
Non.
Voulez-vous
qu'on reprenne depuis le dťbut ?
Oý est Lyle ?
Aucune idťe,
mais il semblait rťellement
troublť d'apprendre
que M. Lee ťtait liť
avec votre pŤre.
Assez attendu.
Allons trouver ce type.
Bonjour, J.R.
Je m'appelle Sidney.
Voici Mlle Parker.
Je connais votre visage.
On me le dit souvent.
Ecoute, J.R.
Tu dois nous dire
ce que M. Lee
voulait savoir sur Jarod.
Jarod a des ennuis ?
Peut-Ítre.
Je veux l'aider.
Il m'a sauvť la vie deux fois.
La 1re,
je ne le connaissais pas.
<i>Mon chťri !</i>
<i>Tu m'entends ?</i>
<i>Il est en ťtat de choc.</i>
<i>Il respire.</i>
<i>- Il est hypoglycťmique.</i>
<i>- Quand a-t-il mangť ?</i>
<i>Il a mangť des cťrťales</i>
<i>il y a 4 heures.</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?</i>
<i>Il lui faut du sucre.</i>
<i>Prends Áa.</i>
<i>Laisse-le fondre.</i>
<i>C'est bien.</i>
<i>Ca va, mon chťri.</i>
<i>Tout va bien.</i>
M. Lee semblait intťressť
par le fait
que Jarod ait su
que j'ťtais malade.
Ton coeur.
J'avais besoin d'une greffe.
Ma mŤre n'espťrait plus
que j'en aie une ŗ temps.
C'est alors
que Jarod est apparu.
<i>Comment va-t-il ?</i>
<i>Mieux.</i>
<i>Il est cardiaque.</i>
<i>Ses doigts et ses lŤvres</i>
<i>sont bleu‚tres.</i>
<i>Apparemment,</i>
<i>votre fils est trŤs malade.</i>
<i>Vous Ítes mťdecin ?</i>
<i>Pas en ce moment.</i>
<i>Pourquoi</i>
<i>il n'a pas eu de greffe ?</i>
<i>Il est sur liste d'attente.</i>
<i>Il est AB nťgatif,</i>
<i>ce qui est trŤs rare.</i>
<i>Ca n'arrive</i>
<i>qu'ŗ certaines familles.</i>
<i>Une personne sur 300 000.</i>
<i>Je sais.</i>
<i>C'est mon cas.</i>
Tu dis qu'il t'a sauvť
la vie deux fois.
Il m'a trouvť un coeur.
<i>Reste avec moi.</i>
<i>Je t'emmŤne ŗ l'hŰpital.</i>
<i>C'est trop tard, Jarod.</i>
<i>Ne dis pas Áa.</i>
<i>Regarde-moi !</i>
<i>Je t'en prie, pense...</i>
<i>ŗ tout ce qu'on va vivre ensemble.</i>
<i>Excuse-moi, Jarod.</i>
<i>Pour quoi ?</i>
<i>Pour tout.</i>
Jarod t'a donnť
le coeur de son frŤre.
Depuis la greffe, il appelle.
Pour s'informer de ma santť,
de ce que je deviens.
Jarod est le grand frŤre
que je n'ai jamais eu.
M. Lee trouvait Áa important.
Merci, J.R.
Sam va te raccompagner.
Viens, coeur vaillant.
M. Lee resserre l'ťtau.
Compassion, empathie, dťsir
de justice.
Tout ce qui dťfinit Jarod.
Vous croyez qu'il anticipera
le prochain coup de Jarod ?
Qu'il l'attrapera ?
Sauf si on est plus rapides.
Cet appel de M. Lee
au bureau de votre pŤre...
Il n'ťtait pas pour M. Parker.
Il allait dans son bureau ?
Techniquement, oui.
Techniquement ?
Une seconde ligne
vient d'Ítre installťe
chez votre pŤre.
Il partage son bureau
avec une autre personne,
ŗ qui l'appel ťtait destinť.
A qui est cette ligne,
ŗ tout hasard ?
Brigitte.
Question idiote !
Elle n'est pas lŗ.
J'ai interceptť un autre appel
ŗ M. Lee.
Elle est partie en limousine.
Celle de M. Lee.
Ils sont aprŤs Jarod.
Nous allons attraper Jarod.
Comment l'avez-vous trouvť ?
C'est simple : en interrogeant
des gens que Jarod a connus,
j'ai compris sa faÁon de penser.
Et surtout sa faÁon
de ressentir les choses.
On a dťchiffrť le code,
son schťma de conduite.
Il a besoin de dťfendre
les victimes du pouvoir.
Ce besoin
le conduit
ŗ des situations prťvisibles.
Telles que ?
Celles qui sont liťes
au traumatisme de son enfance
et ŗ son sentiment de culpabilitť.
Anna a imaginť
toutes sortes de scťnarios
susceptibles de l'attirer.
Nous avons trouvť
celui qui nous conduira ŗ lui.
Dommage que mes futurs
beaux-enfants ne soient pas lŗ.
Vous Ítes
dťlicieusement polissonne.
Merci, M. Lee !
Un Chinois aveugle
et une pťtasse dans une limousine,
Áa se trouve !
On cherche Jarod depuis 2 ans
et cette garce va l'attraper.
Lyle, Áa va ?
Vous semblez mal en point.
Vous devriez voir ce type.
Mal lunť ?
J'ai ťtť enlevť
par les hommes de Lee.
Ils m'ont eu,
mais je leur ai donnť
du fil ŗ retordre !
Lee m'a interrogť
mais il a fini par laisser tomber.
Ses agents m'ont l‚chť
dans la nature.
Tu remercieras Brigitte
pour ce moment avec M. Lee.
Il travaille pour elle.
Elle va coincer Jarod.
Pas si on arrive avant.
J'ai localisť le signal d'appel.
Il devrait nous conduire
ŗ Brigitte et M. Lee.
Qui nous conduiront ŗ Jarod.
<i>Merci, Jarod.</i>
<i>Je t'en prie.</i>
Abner va enfin pouvoir
rentrer ŗ la maison.
Comment vous remercier
pour ce que vous avez fait ?
La voilŗ, ma rťcompense.
Bonne chance, Abner.
DrŰle d'endroit oý trouver Jarod.
Un gťnie dans un asile
d'attardťs mentaux.
Jarod a dťcouvert
que de nombreux patients
ťtaient victimes de diagnostics
volontairement erronťs.
Le directeur les garde
pour escroquer leur assurance
et leurs parents.
Ils sont prisonniers
de l'institution.
Et Jarod vient les dťlivrer.
Que c'est noble !
Attendez.
C'est pas vrai !
Qu'est-ce que vous faites lŗ ?
Le plaisir est pour moi.
Oý est-il ?
- Je dois le capturer.
- Pas question.
Tu ne me voleras pas
cette affaire.
Ca suffit.
Il faut trouver Jarod.
Il a filť.
Tu as le don de l'ťvidence.
Il savait qu'on venait.
<i>...les services de M. Lee...</i>
<i>Brigitte.</i>
Il savait depuis le dťbut.
Il a interceptť votre mťmo.
De Brigitte ŗ papa :
"Sollicite les services de M. Lee
pour capturer Jarod."
Quelqu'un l'a aidť.
Vous avez tout fait rater,
mon ange.
Quelqu'un l'a informť
de notre prťsence.
Anna...
Merci de votre aide.
Vous avez aidť tant de gens.
A votre tour d'Ítre aidť.
C'ťtait courageux de votre part.
Je le referais sans hťsiter.
AprŤs ce que vous avez fait
pour mon neveu,
c'est moi qui vous remercie.
J'espŤre qu'on se reverra.
Moi aussi.

NICE FELLOW
Double paire, qui dit mieux ?
C'est bon
pour les gosses.
Je mise cinquante.
Zipper ?
Avec une paire...
Je me couche.
Smokey ?
Charmant. Tu embrasses ta mère
avec cette bouche ?
J'arrête.
Il reste plus que toi et moi.
Voyons ce que tu mises.
J'ai besoin de fric.
Je suis à cinquante.
Et je monte
de cinquante.
Il a une quinte flush.
Impossible. 11 piques sont sortis.
Il en reste 2 dans le paquet.
Un seul suffit.
Je suis à cinquante
<i>que je veux survivre !</i>
On est à sec ?
Je n'ai plus de liquide sur moi.
Mais j'ai ma montre. Ca marche ?
Voyons ça.
C'est une Omega C-Master.
Ca vaut au moins 4 000 $.
6 000.
Je te la donne
contre 327 $
et... ton chapeau.
Mon chapeau ?
Tout ce que tu as à faire,
c'est miser.
N'oublie pas,
les 8 et les as
sont les cartes du mort,
Bill le Féroce !
Tu permets ?
Désolée.
L'heure tourne.
Dernier appel pour Hartford,
Boston et Albany,
quai numéro 7.
En voiture !
Il a une quinte flush.
Laisse tomber. On y va.
Ferme-la.
Prends-le.
Repassez quand vous voulez.
Tu avais le flush ?
Tu veux savoir ?
Bonne route.
Tu es un sacré bluffeur !
Où tu as appris à jouer ?
J'ai lu ce livre.
Il est très bien.
Il me faut un ticket.
Pour le prochain départ.
J'ai un départ pour Baltimore
dans 10 minutes.
Parfait. Merci.
Vous voulez prendre le bus
et revenir ici ?
Il y a des toilettes ?
Au fond.
Sors de là, Rachel.
Je ne m'enfuis pas.
Une gare routière !
C'est mauvais signe.
J'ai besoin de réfléchir.
Je n'ai pas de bagages.
Tu connais l'enjeu ?
Oui, je sais.
Ouvre la porte, qu'on règle ça
entre gens raisonnables.
Tu as 3 secondes, salope,
sinon j'arrive.
Je crois
que c'est pour les dames.
Sortez.
Il est mort ?
Je ne crois pas.
Vous savez
ce que vous avez fait ?
Je vous ai aidée !
Mêlez-vous de vos affaires !
Quelqu'un pourrait en mourir !
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>à cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
C'est un Caméléon.
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>Il défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
"Nous avons le plaisir
d'annoncer nos fiançailles.
"Joignez-vous à nous
"pour fêter notre bonheur."
C'est de la folie pure et simple !
C'est le Centre.
Drôle de couple !
Pour le meilleur et pour le pire.
Des nouvelles
de la gare routière ?
On cherche encore.
Jarod est sur la vidéo de contrôle
mais dans aucun bus.
J'ai une équipe
qui travaille là-dessus.
Mlle Parker,
j'aimerais m'en aller.
J'ai un rendez-vous ce soir.
Charlene Reynolds.
Elle travaille à la comptabilité.
Elle est pas mal.
A part les dents.
J'ai aussi des projets.
Vous allez au cirque ?
Mary Winfield présente
son dernier recueil de poésie.
Ca doit être tordant.
Et vous ?
Bonne soirée.
<i>Salut, c'est Rachel. Les enfants</i>
<i>et moi, on est occupés.</i>
<i>Laissez un message,</i>
<i>on vous rappelle. Pas vrai ?</i>
<i>Salut, tout le monde !</i>
Vous avez oublié
ce que j'ai dit ?
Ca me revient, maintenant.
Tournez-vous.
Doucement !
Que faites-vous chez moi ?
J'ai votre adresse.
Votre main !
Ma poche.
D'où ça sort ?
Votre ami de la gare routière
me l'a donnée.
C'est la Compagnie ?
De bus ?
Soyez sérieux ou je tire.
Devant vos enfants ?
Vous avez une belle famille.
Où sont-ils ?
Je ne m'enfuyais pas.
Il n'est pas avec toi ?
Non, je comprends.
J'ai dit que je comprenais.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Rock Creek Park, 10 h.
D'accord, j'y serai.
- Votre nom ?
- Jarod.
Tournez-vous, Jarod.
Je préfère éviter.
Tournez-vous.
Vous vous êtes déjà senti seul ?
Comme dans une chambre noire
sans porte ?
Toute ma vie.
C'est ce qu'ils m'ont fait.
Ils ont éteint la lumière.
Pardon.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
Imagine que je suis
les Nations unies
et que je viens
pour éviter une guerre.
Jamais je n'attaquerais
une personne désarmée.
Soyons raisonnables.
D'ailleurs, je crois
que ta petite soeur et moi,
on peut s'entendre.
Pas vrai, ma chérie ?
On peut se tuer à essayer.
Tu as repris ?
Je m'apprêtais
à vider mon bureau.
Et j'aimerais m'y remettre.
Il te faut une vie privée.
Votre père et moi
avons une relation particulière.
J'espère qu'un jour
vous trouverez le bonheur.
Tu as pu laisser faire ça ?
C'est aussi étrange
pour moi que pour toi
que notre père épouse Brigitte.
Dire que j'ai couché avec elle !
Mais ça n'est pas parce que
tu n'as pas trouvé le bonheur
que tu dois le refuser aux autres.
Tu as un vilain bleu.
Où est ton héros ?
Que veux-tu ?
Prends la mallette sous le siège.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Tais-toi.
Une chambre t'attend
à l'hôtel Chester.
Elle est réservée
au nom d'Andrews.
Prends la mallette
et attends-moi là-bas.
J'ai fait ce que tu demandais.
Je peux les voir ?
Si ça ne tenait qu'à moi,
je te tuerais.
Je t'appellerai.
Oui ou non ?
Seul son cardiologue le sait.
Faites des provisions
de viande rouge et de beignets.
Pourquoi gâcher
un bel infarctus ?
On se connaît ?
Thomas Gates.
Mes amis m'appellent Tommy.
Comment vous appellent vos amis ?
Je n'ai pas d'amis.
2 ans, 3 mois, 21 jours.
Le temps écoulé
depuis ma dernière cigarette.
- Et vous ?
- Je ne compte plus.
Bon sang !
Vous croyez au destin ?
Je vous en prie !
Une ex-fumeuse intelligente risque
de l'argent durement gagné
pour rejoindre
le club nicotine.
La machine fonctionne mal,
ce qui permet
à un inconnu en jeans
de la convaincre
de ne pas entrer dans ce club.
Le destin !
Pourquoi devrait-on fuir
ceux qu'on aime ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Quelqu'un qui essaie
de vous rendre votre lumière.
Que pensiez-vous faire de ça ?
Récupérer mes enfants.
Ce projet s'appelait "M-2".
J'avais 22 ans quand ils m'ont
recrutée à l'université.
Qui ça ? La Compagnie ?
Pourquoi la CIA s'intéressait
à des étudiants ?
On était les meilleurs
analystes en informatique.
Ils nous ont formés
à la création de simulations.
Des scénarios hypothétiques.
Kidnapping,
sabotage, assassinat.
On nous faisait croire
que c'était un entraînement.
Combien de personnes
travaillaient au M-2 ?
Cinq, y compris moi.
On avait une formation militaire.
J'étais officier de réserve.
Vous savez donc vous servir
d'une arme.
Mon père était tireur d'élite.
J'étais meilleure que lui.
J'ai commencé
à lire des articles...
sur des attentats terroristes,
des crimes politiques
et j'ai reconnu nos dossiers.
C'est affreux de savoir
que des gens
meurent à cause de soi.
Et d'avoir tellement
de sang innocent sur les mains.
Je comprends.
J'ai demandé mon transfert.
Pour Renfro,
autant lui demander un rein.
Renfro ?
Alex E.
Le responsable du M-2.
Et alors ?
J'ai avalé des petites quantités
de poison.
Des pesticides.
Après un mois de vomissements,
Renfro a lui-même signé
mon transfert.
Et votre mari ?
Il est parti
après la naissance de Zach.
Alors, au bout de 10 ans
sans aucune nouvelle du M-2,
ils débarquent
et enlèvent vos enfants ?
C'était il y a 10 jours.
<i>Je faisais la vaisselle.</i>
<i>Melinda et Zachery dessinaient.</i>
<i>On a frappé à la porte.</i>
<i>Il y a souvent des colporteurs</i>
<i>qui passent dans le coin.</i>
<i>Maggie, notre chien,</i>
<i>a commencé à aboyer.</i>
<i>J'ai demandé aux enfants</i>
<i>d'aller voir Maggie</i>
<i>et j'ai ouvert.</i>
<i>Quand j'ai vu</i>
<i>qu'il n'y avait personne,</i>
<i>mon coeur s'est arrêté aussitôt.</i>
<i>J'ai couru derrière la maison.</i>
<i>Les enfants avaient disparu.</i>
<i>Zachery ? Melinda ?</i>
J'ai reçu un appel juste après.
Je n'ai pas reconnu la voix,
mais le message était clair.
Je leur obéis
ou ils tuent mes enfants.
Je ne sais pas
qui je dois tuer !
Ils vous le diront
en temps voulu.
Le type est aux toilettes.
Trop d'eau-de-vie.
Je vais vous aider.
Je peux me débrouiller. Merci.
Vous habitez Bryer, non ?
On n'a pas le droit
de traquer les gens.
Je restaure la maison
au-dessus de la vôtre.
Ce dépotoir sur la colline ?
C'est merveilleux de découvrir
un parquet du XVIIe siècle
sous une couche de lino vert.
Je ne peux que l'imaginer.
Vous n'avez pas de passions,
Mlle Parker ?
Vous connaissez mon nom !
Les gens parlent.
"Gates, restaurateur
L'ancien se refait une jeunesse"
C'est de moi.
Adieu, Hemingway !
Passez une bonne journée,
Mlle Parker.
Vous le méritez.
Et le chameau dit : "Tu bosses ?"
"Pourquoi ?"
"Tu bosses" ! Elle est bonne !
- J'ai besoin de vous.
- Cette blague est tordante.
Au travail, rigolo !
Thomas Michael Gates.
Trouvez son parcours,
ses origines.
Tout. Et je veux ces infos
dans mon bureau, sans tarder.
Qui est-ce ?
Le plus tôt sera le mieux.
Mlle Parker ?
Vous connaissez celle
du coyote, du chacal
et du tatou borgne ?
Rachel ?
J'ai obtenu cette photo
grâce aux archives fédérales.
- Vous reconnaissez quelqu'un ?
- Alex Renfro.
Quoi ?
J'ai vérifié son dossier.
Il est soupçonné
de 6 crimes politiques.
Il était sur la liste du FBI.
Pourquoi "était" ?
Renfro est mort dans un accident
de bus au Honduras en 1995.
J'ai enquêté
sur les autres membres du M-2.
Tous sont morts.
Ainsi que leurs familles.
Soi-disant par accident.
Mon Dieu !
Chacune de ces morts
a été précédée
dans les 48 h
d'un crime politique.
Ils font pareil avec moi.
Une fois votre mission accomplie,
ils vous tueront...
ainsi que votre famille.
Repassons tout ça en revue.
Renfro et les autres membres
du M-2 sont morts.
Quelqu'un d'autre pourrait-il
être mêlé à ça ?
Personne.
Réfléchissez bien.
C'est déjà fait !
Ma vie est devenue un cauchemar !
Il y a 10 jours, je voyais
des profs, je faisais des gâteaux.
Maintenant, j'attends
qu'on me dise qui tuer !
Désolé.
On devrait faire une pause.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Comment ça ?
Vous me sauvez
dans les toilettes,
vous avez accès
à des dossiers ultrasecrets,
vous semblez prévoir
ce que je ressens !
Qui êtes-vous ?
Un type qui attend le bus.
Je poireaute
comme un livreur de pizza !
J'étais dans la salle de bains.
Tu t'es installée.
La vue n'est pas terrible.
Je n'avais pas remarqué.
Détends-toi.
Tu as l'air coupable
avant même d'avoir tué !
Ouvre.
Où tu vas ?
Dans la salle de bains.
Tu permets ?
Le sénateur Sanford Reest.
Il fait un discours à Slayton Hall
ce soir.
Il arrive dans une heure
pour la répétition.
Je suis censée faire quoi ?
On pourra accéder
par une porte de service.
Dès que Reest
a fini la répétition,
tu lui tires une balle
dans le front.
Jolies serviettes.
Pourquoi ?
Ne rate pas ton coup...
maman.
Merci. A demain !
Si on continue à se voir,
les gens vont jaser.
Qu'ils jasent.
Je n'y prête pas attention.
Vous avez raison.
Ce soir, c'est la pleine lune.
Ca arrive chaque mois.
Je sais que c'est un peu abrupt,
mais je pensais aller essayer
mon télescope sur les falaises.
Vous m'accompagnez ?
C'était la pire
des tentatives de drague
de toute l'Histoire ?
Vous voulez venir ?
Je suis du genre
à traîner dans les bois ?
Pas avec ces chaussures mais...
on ne sait jamais.
On peut plonger
dans une expérience nouvelle.
Vous me comprenez ?
Navrée de vous déranger,
mais il y a une urgence.
Quel genre ?
Du genre personnel.
On se retrouve au bureau.
Une camarade ?
Je dois y aller. Désolée.
Tout ça était une erreur.
Je serai près du pont,
si vous changez d'avis.
Ca n'arrivera pas.
Vous ne pouvez pas
garder ces chaussures !
<i>Je suggère</i>
<i>un 2e et 3e scénarios.</i>
<i>Tir à l'arme automatique</i>
<i>de derrière le bâtiment</i>
<i>et accident de voiture bidon.</i>
Devinez qui je viens de voir !
Que faites-vous ?
Vous travaillez pour qui ?
CIA ?
NSA ? Qui ?
Vous vous trompez.
Vous semblez mêlé
à une sale affaire.
Je vous faisais confiance
pour mes enfants !
Alex Renfro est vivant.
Je l'ai vu devant l'hôtel.
Il est derrière
tout ce qui vous arrive.
Dans la penderie.
Vous savez ce qui vous attend !
- Je lui parlerai !
- Je vous aiderai.
Je lui parlerai !
Dans la penderie !
Mes enfants passent avant vous !
Vous commettez une erreur.
J'assume.
Rachel, écoutez-moi !
Que faisiez-vous là-bas ?
Mon travail.
En m'espionnant ?
En suivant les ordres.
Je dois reconnaître...
que Thomas est mignon.
A condition d'aimer
le genre réparateur de frigo
aux ongles noirs !
Pourquoi vous mêlez-vous encore
de ma vie ?
Votre père et moi,
on tient à vous.
On veut votre bien.
C'est un ordre de papa ?
Vous ne savez rien
de cet homme.
Il peut être dangereux,
sans parler...
des déviations sexuelles.
Il est menuisier.
C'est ce qu'il dit.
Vous ne devez plus avoir
aucun contact avec lui
avant qu'on ait vérifié
son passé.
C'est un ordre ?
Qui vient de très haut.
N'imaginez pas être leur égale,
car vous ne l'êtes pas.
N'oubliez jamais d'où vous venez.
Jamais.
Que faites-vous ici ?
Qu'y a-t-il au-dessus
de la cabine de contrôle ?
- La passerelle.
- Comment y accéder ?
Par là.
Joe, baisse la lumière.
Mon Dieu, pardonne-moi.
Ne faites pas ça.
Arrêtez.
Vous m'avez demandé si je savais
ce que c'était d'avoir du sang
innocent sur les mains. Je sais.
J'essaie de fuir.
Je passe ma vie
à essayer de me racheter.
J'ai peur.
Je sais.
Mais si vous tuez cet homme,
vous n'aurez plus de vie.
Vos enfants non plus.
Je ne veux tuer personne.
J'y suis obligée.
S'il y a un moyen
de sauver vos enfants...
je le trouverai.
Ou je mourrai en essayant.
Promis.
Je vous en prie, posez ce fusil.
Vous venez de lui sauver la vie.
Mais j'ai tué mes enfants.
Où on va ?
Je ne sais pas encore.
Comment ça ?
Vous me décevez, Rachel.
Renfro !
<i>On essaie</i>
<i>de résoudre les problèmes ?</i>
Vous avez créé
un grand dilemme
pour vos enfants.
Pourquoi avoir désobéi ?
Ne les touchez pas !
Ca n'est plus de mon ressort.
Je ferai n'importe quoi !
Ecoutez-moi.
<i>Il y a un joueur de plus.</i>
Le chevalier
de la gare routière !
Vous êtes derrière
les morts du M-2.
Et vous avez fait le mort
pour semer le FBI.
Ce sont vos meilleures cartes ?
J'ai une vidéo où on vous voit
devant l'hôtel Chester.
J'ai Rachel,
votre dernier témoin.
Si vous ne rendez pas
les enfants,
j'appelle le FBI
<i>et je leur dis</i>
<i>que vous êtes vivant.</i>
<i>Vous ne trouverez refuge</i>
<i>nulle part sur terre.</i>
Vous avez 30 secondes
pour vous décider.
Qu'est-ce qui vous prend ?
Vous êtes fou ?
- Il va rappeler.
- Et sinon ?
Ce sont mes enfants !
Encore du sang innocent
sur vos mains.
Je vous écoute.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
Soyons prudents avec ce type.
On retrouve
Rachel et le chevalier,
on échange les gosses
contre la cassette.
On les suit chez eux
et tu les tues.
Rachel !
Ca fait longtemps.
Vous êtes superbe.
Où sont mes enfants ?
Près. Tout près.
La cassette en question.
Où sont les enfants ?
Et si vous prévenez quand même
les autorités ?
Je me moque de vous.
Je veux ma famille.
Je vous crois.
Notre affaire semble réglée.
Vérifiez la cassette.
J'espère
que vous ne serez pas déçu.
Je n'oublierai pas ça.
<i>Avant de poursuivre,</i>
<i>bravo pour votre superbe partie</i>
<i>de poker,</i>
<i>vos assassins au profil bas,</i>
<i>votre fausse mort</i>
<i>pour couper tout lien</i>
<i>avec les crimes,</i>
<i>l'élimination des témoins</i>
<i>et de leurs proches.</i>
<i>J'ai compris que jamais</i>
<i>vous ne laisseriez Rachel</i>
<i>et ses enfants s'en tirer,</i>
<i>même en ayant</i>
<i>ce que vous vouliez.</i>
<i>Comme je l'ai déjà dit...</i>
<i>il y a un joueur de plus.</i>
<i>Mais vous n'allez pas</i>
<i>aimer vos nouvelles cartes.</i>
<i>Allez-y, ouvrez l'enveloppe.</i>
Des as et des huit.
Les cartes du mort.
<i>C'est exactement</i>
<i>ce que vous êtes.</i>
Mon Dieu !
Descendez de voiture !

<i>Il est minuit. Quel choc</i>
<i>de trouver encore au bureau !</i>
J'allais partir.
<i>J'ai rencontré</i>

Intelligente,
compatissante... et tourmentée.
C'est ce que je suis ?
<i>Elle était prisonnière</i>

NICE FELLOW
Etrange,
Jarod n'a rien laissé ą Hawaļ.
Comme s'il voulait
se débarrasser de nous.
Demandez pourquoi
on n'a pas atterri.
- Ne m'obligez pas ą me lever.
- Vous détestez l'avion ?
Je ne déteste pas l'avion,
je déteste vomir.
C'est important.
On n'a rien sur Jarod.
Qu'y a-t-il de si urgent ?
Un rendez-vous sentimental ?
Vous źtes toujours aussi bavard ?
Je suis un psy,
je n'y peux rien.
Comment s'appelle-t-il ?
Vous l'avez appelé de chez Jarod,
pas vrai ?
Vous étiez rayonnante.
Je ne "rayonne" pas, Sidney.
Il s'appelle Thomas
et il fait des travaux chez moi.
C'est un réparateur.
Qu'est-ce qui est cassé ?
D'aprčs le pilote,
on va tourner une heure ou deux.
Merci, Jarod.
Dire qu'il est en train
de se faire bronzer !
Debout, gros malin !
Réveille-toi,
tu vas faire trempette.
<i>On m'a enlevé ą ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déją</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>ą cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>Il défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous źtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
<i>Depuis mon enfance,</i>
<i>on me dit que je suis ą part.</i>
<i>Que j'ai un don,</i>
<i>que je peux źtre qui je veux.</i>
<i>Je n'imaginais pas finir ici,</i>
<i>dans l'Atlantique,</i>
<i>transformé en ancre humaine.</i>
<i>Mais je devrais peut-źtre</i>
<i>commencer par le début.</i>
... "Vous źtes avocat ?"
Alors, je dis :
"Les avocats sont des ordures."
Mon voisin : "Retirez ēa".
Moi : "Vous źtes avocat ?"
Lui : "Non, une ordure."
<i>Le Coin des Comiques.</i>
<i>Des blagues aussi nulles</i>
<i>que les clients.</i>
<i>Personne ne riait,</i>
<i>surtout pas moi.</i>
<i>Je faisais les annonces,</i>
<i>sans savoir qui les passait.</i>
<i>Ca ne pouvait pas venir du Centre,</i>
<i>mais je devais źtre prudent.</i>
<i>Je n'avais donc rien laissé</i>
<i>ą Hawaļ.</i>
<i>Et j'aurais dū filer en découvrant</i>
<i>l'auteur des annonces :</i>
<i>Argyle, qui m'avait sauvé une fois</i>
<i>avant de me vendre au Centre.</i>
Vous appelez ēa un martini ?
Mon chien en voudrait pas.
Et pas d'olives,
il est allergique au piment.
Mźme sans ēa,
je lui en donnerais pas.
C'est un bon petit gars.
Méchante fille !
Ca biche ? Je savais
que t'aurais mon message.
La moitié de la cōte Est
l'a eu.
En tout cas, ēa a marché.
Chien, tu connais Jarod ?
Cool Raoul !
Regarde-nous.
Enfin réunis !
T'as toujours tes faux papiers ?
T'es qui, cette semaine ?
Un pigeon.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Ce que je veux ?
Deux autres martinis.
Sans olives.
Je veux que tout le monde
soit content.
- A commencer par toi.
- Evidemment.
Mais ēa va déją pas mal.
Je suis un gros bonnet, ici.
Qui tu as vendu ?
Tu sais quoi ? C'est bas.
Mais je te pardonne.
Tu t'es cassé le doigt ?
- Accident du travail.
- Pour ēa, il faut travailler.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Voilą le topo.
Il y a ce type, Faddas.
Sonny Faddas.
C'est le genre entrepreneur.
Un ami ą moi.
Un ami rompt le pain,
pas la main.
Je pige, mais tu te goures.
Il a des gens
qui font ēa pour lui.
Récemment, il m'a fourni
un petit pécule.
Combien tu lui dois ?
- 5 000 dollars.
- Quoi ?
Tu m'as fait venir ici
pour 5 000 $ ?
Ce Sonny Faddas,
c'est pas de la gnognote.
Il m'a fait choisir un doigt.
J'ai choisi celui-lą
pour garder l'index.
Si je rembourse pas ce type,
tu peux faire une croix
sur Argyle.
Et 5 000 $,
qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Tu m'as vendu pour 10 000.
Je sais ce que j'ai fait.
Je sais que c'était mal.
Je sais aussi que toi et moi,
on est pareils.
Prends pas cet air. On sait
ce que c'est d'źtre seul
et d'avoir personne
vers qui se tourner.
Je n'ai que toi, Jarod.
<i>J'entamais ma mission</i>
<i>la plus délicate :</i>
<i>devenir l'ami d'Argyle.</i>
T'es un chef !
<i>Pas besoin de faux papiers...</i>
T'es un chef.
Envoyez-nous deux verres.
<i>...juste beaucoup de patience,</i>
<i>et pas de bon sens.</i>
Vous semblez tendue.
Thomas doit faire
des réparations importantes.
Je l'ai rencontré récemment
et on a passé une soirée ensemble.
A parler.
Il travaillait ą Wall Street,
mais il est parti.
Il restaure une ruine
ą cōté de chez moi.
Il appelle ēa
des "travaux en cours".
J'avais besoin de faire
des travaux chez moi, alors...
<i>J'aimerais dire qu'il est venu</i>
<i>pour un simple dégāt des eaux,</i>
<i>mais c'était plus que ēa.</i>
C'est un dégāt des eaux.
Jolie maison, n'empźche.
Elle a du cachet.
Elle est vieille.
Oui, mais elle a
une bonne charpente.
Une location ?
C'est un cadeau.
Mon pčre me l'a offerte
ą la fin de mes études.
C'était...
une sorte de cachette
pour mes parents.
Ca doit źtre maman.
Je lui ressemble, je sais.
Elle est morte
quand j'étais petite.
Ca a dū źtre dur.
Vous savez ce qui serait bien ?
Une couleur plus claire.
En enlevant
les vitres teintées,
il y aurait plus de lumičre
dans la maison.
Assainissez ce mur
et passez une couche de peinture.
Mźme couleur.
Quoi ?
Vous źtes une faiseuse.
- Une "faiseuse" ?
- Oui.
Quand je faisais de la maēonnerie
pour payer mes études,
il y avait 2 sortes
de maītresses de maison :
les girouettes,
qui changeaient toujours d'avis,
qui rediscutaient les plans
une fois installées ;
et les faiseuses.
Les faiseuses
nous donnaient leurs instructions
une seule fois.
J'obtiens toujours ce que je veux.
<i>On dit que l'amour</i>
<i>fait tourner le monde.</i>
<i>C'est plutōt l'argent,</i>
<i>dans le monde d'Argyle.</i>
<i>Je lui avais donné 5 000 $</i>
<i>du Centre,</i>
<i>mais en allant rembourser</i>
<i>M. Faddas,</i>
<i>Argyle voulut s'arrźter.</i>
<i>Or, avec Argyle,</i>
<i>la surprise est au coin de la rue.</i>
<i>C'était un pičtre Caméléon,</i>
<i>mais il avait raison :</i>
<i>on se ressemblait.</i>
<i>Il y avait une chose en lui</i>
<i>que je comprenais.</i>
Chien ?
Il faut qu'il aille sur le balcon.
Installe-toi.
Bon Dieu !
Je t'ai dit sur le balcon.
Pas un geste ! J'ai maté
des SS plus gros que toi.
Si tu crois pouvoir te pointer ici
et me dévaliser
pour une dose de saloperie,
t'es mal barré.
Fais tes pričres !
Tout doux ! C'est mon ami.
Cet homme est mon ami.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais lą ?
J'ai pas le droit de venir ?
J'ai du boulot.
Mais pas de maničres.
Benny, médecin-major
de la 101e aéroportée
pendant la 2e Guerre mondiale.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
De la poigne. Ca signifie
que vous źtes bon cavalier.
J'ai été clown de rodéo.
Ca explique que vous bossiez
avec mon fils.
Papa, Jarod, comme moi,
a élargi ses horizons
dans le prestigieux domaine
de l'informatique.
C'est l'heure du médicament.
L'horloge sacrée a parlé.
Soigne ta santé, Jarod.
C'est tout ce qu'on a,
avec le cérumen
et les poils au nez.
Demoxidyle,
Recrotin...
Déséquilibre enzymatique ?
Neurologique.
C'est pour ēa que je boite.
Ca peut źtre les enzymes...
Enchanté, Jerry.
Le pape revient.
Il n'est pas enregistré ?
On n'interrompt pas le Pontife.
C'était pour lui, les 5 000 $ ?
L'assurance de l'armée
ne couvre pas ses besoins.
Maman est morte l'an passé.
Depuis, il décline.
Ils avaient vu le pape
en 1995.
Juste aprčs que maman
tombe malade.
Les médecins
lui donnaient un mois.
Mon pčre jure que le pape
lui a donné 3 ans de rab.
Il veut aller au Vatican,
le voir, entendre la messe.
Le remercier, peut-źtre.
5 000 $, ēa paye le voyage.
Je sais, mais...
Mais quoi ?
Un des hommes de Faddas
gčre mes gros investissements...
Tu as emprunté 5 000 $
pour les perdre au jeu ?
Je veux offrir ą mon pčre
un voyage de premičre.
C'est trop demander ?
<i>Argyle avait du coeur,</i>
<i>mais pas de cervelle.</i>
<i>Je le pressai</i>
<i>de rembourser Faddas.</i>
Faddas va faire une de ces tźtes !
Il insista pour y aller seul.
Sois prudent.
<i>Je compris vite que Faddas</i>
<i>était un requin.</i>
<i>Un sale caractčre</i>
<i>doublé d'un assassin.</i>
<i>Il avait toute la cōte</i>
<i>et le monopole des fruits de mer</i>
<i>ą Atlantic City.</i>
<i>Il était clair</i>
<i>qu'Argyle était dans le pétrin.</i>
<i>Et qu'il avait le dos...</i>
<i>au mur.</i>
T'as mon pognon !
Qui c'était ?
Eux ? Les hommes de Faddas.
Les Africains.
- Des Africains ?
- D'Afrique du Sud.
Ecoute, Argyle.
Ils ne t'auraient pas fait ēa
si tu avais payé.
Alors ?
Je leur dois un service.
Aprčs, je suis libre.
Ne le dis pas.
Ne le pense mźme pas.
Je bosse en solo,
sur ce coup-lą.
T'inquičte pas, mec.
Merci pour tout.
Les cinq briques
seront bientōt sur ton compte.
Laisse-moi juste un peu de temps.
On dit que c'est
le meilleur ami de l'homme,
mais mon meilleur ami, c'est toi.
Tiens, Argyle.
Deux billets de 1re classe
pour le Vatican.
Assure-toi
que ton pčre voie le pape.
Je peux pas.
Il faut que ēa vienne de moi.
T'en as assez fait.
Prends soin de toi.
<i>Les remords</i>
<i>peuvent źtre dangereux,</i>
<i>mais j'ai pensé que si je laissais</i>
<i>Argyle et Chien,</i>
<i>ce serait comme si</i>
<i>je laissais deux animaux blessés</i>
<i>dans un pičge.</i>
<i>Je ne pouvais pas faire ēa.</i>
Vous venez ou quoi ?
Tu priais pour ton pčre ?
C'est lui qui me l'a donné.
Il est plastifié.
Il l'avait acheté avec maman
en 1995.
Je priais pour qu'il voie
le pape ą temps.
A temps ?
Oui, Jarod.
Il va mourir.
<i>La situation d'Argyle</i>
<i>me rappela ce que je savais</i>
<i>depuis longtemps :</i>
<i>en attendant</i>
<i>de trouver ma famille,</i>
<i>aider des gens comme Benny</i>
<i>et Argyle était la meilleure</i>
<i>chose ą faire.</i>
<i>Sur la fin, les choses allaient</i>
<i>plutōt bien.</i>
<i>Mais comment deviner</i>
<i>que le milieu serait</i>
un tel méli-mélo ?
<i>Faddas avait une mission</i>
<i>pour Argyle :</i>
<i>ramasser un sac d'argent</i>
<i>dans une poubelle.</i>
<i>Mais une chose me tracassait :</i>
<i>pourquoi Faddas</i>
<i>faisait-il confiance ą Argyle ?</i>
<i>Aprčs tout, Argyle était le genre</i>
<i>ą appeler son chien...</i>
<i>Chien.</i>
<i>"T'inquičte", me dit Argyle.</i>
<i>Un instant, je le crus.</i>
<i>Un court instant.</i>
<i>En fait, l'argent du sac</i>
<i>n'appartenait pas ą Faddas,</i>
<i>mais ą ce type, qui s'appelait</i>
<i>le Cubain et m'appelait autrement.</i>
Petit Joe de Chicago,
tu crois que tu peux venir
chez moi, tuer mes coursiers
et voler mon fric ?
Ce fric appartient au Cubain.
Au Cubain ?
Vous connaissez pas ?
Pas avec ton accent.
Je ne suis pas un Cubain,
mais le Cubain.
<i>Ces fameux remords...</i>
Et ēa, c'est mon pote.
Bien sage !
Zut, l'argent !
Laisse tomber l'argent.
Toujours K.O.
Vive la Dramamine.
Dites-moi... Ce Thomas,
il sait oł vous travaillez ?
C'est fameux.
Merci pour la bouffe.
C'est déduit de votre paie.
Vieux crabe !
Je vous mčne
ą la baguette.
J'adore cette cuisine.
Vous ne commandez que ēa ?
On m'a dit un jour
que la stabilité
est mčre de succčs.
Quand on n'a pas goūté
au crabe aigre-doux.
Le dernier morceau.
Vous źtes aussi exigeante,
au travail ?
Je suis une faiseuse.
C'est vrai.
Estimation des risques.
Un synonyme d'assurances ?
Un synonyme de stress.
Je résous des problčmes
pour ma compagnie.
Au fait...
je suis allé sur le toit
pour voir la fuite,
le dégāt des eaux.
Il y a peut-źtre une pičce,
derričre.
Réparez le mur, comme on a dit.
Ma compagnie m'oblige
ą porter ēa.
Le travail, c'est le travail.
Je devrais avoir fini samedi,
si vous ne me faites pas
trop manger.
<i>Je regrette qu'il m'ait vue ainsi.</i>
Une arme
est une chose qu'on porte,
ce n'est pas vous.
J'ai froid, Jarod.
Arrźte.
La balle t'a ą peine effleuré.
Comment j'aurais deviné
qu'un Cubain irlandais
péterait les plombs ?
Pourquoi il t'a appelé Petit Joe ?
Il attendait ce "Petit Joe".
Pas de bol, c'est nous
qui avons les biffetons.
C'est Argyle qu'est plein aux as !
<i>Ce que je lisais dans ses yeux</i>
<i>n'était pas de la cupidité...</i>
<i>mais de la peur.</i>
<i>Sans argent,</i>
<i>pas de voyage en Italie</i>
<i>pour son pčre</i>
<i>qui comptait tant pour lui.</i>
Grāce ą moi, personne n'a jamais
été amputé, dans la 101e.
Sauf Bernie Sankowitz,
qui a perdu un orteil.
Le pape plastifié
m'a laissé tomber. C'est quoi ?
C'est pas ma clé.
Sacrée dose de sédatif.
Laisse tomber la piqūre.
Sois un homme, soldat !
<i>La clé ne donnait rien,</i>
<i>mais je retrouvai le Cubain,</i>
<i>alias Dennis O'Quinn.</i>
<i>C'était un gros usurier</i>
<i>d'Atlantic City,</i>
<i>le second aprčs</i>
<i>le Roi des Clams, S. Faddas.</i>
<i>Que faisait-il ą la poubelle ?</i>
<i>Il volait Faddas ?</i>
<i>C'était absurde.</i>
<i>Tout cela est absurde.</i>
<i>J'avais l'impression</i>
<i>que Faddas avait piégé Argyle.</i>
<i>Mais pourquoi ?</i>
<i>On lui avait refourgué la clé.</i>
<i>Sūrement les Africains.</i>
Ils la lui ont refourguée
en lui cassant le doigt.
Il est dans les choux.
T'avais raison :
je l'ai assommé.
Ca va aller.
Pas s'il continue comme ēa.
Un fils doit écouter son pčre.
Il fréquente des saligauds.
Mon Adella l'en aurait empźché.
Elle a un beau sourire.
Elle savait s'occuper de lui.
Il est fils unique ?
Ouais. A sa naissance,
le toubib a dit qu'il fallait
fermer l'usine ą bébés.
Ma douce ne se laissait pas
abattre. Elle disait :
"Argyle a cassé le moule."
Beaucoup de moules.
Si elle était lą,
il ferait pas semblant
d'źtre architecte.
Vous étiez au courant ?
Ce petit est incapable
de filer droit.
Il est pas parfait,
mais son āme est bonne.
Il la tient d'elle.
Ne vous sous-estimez pas.
J'ai fait la guerre,
mais le héros, c'était elle.
Quand je l'ai perdue,
c'est comme si
j'avais été au front
sans aucun contact avec le QG.
J'étais complčtement déboussolé.
Je n'arrive pas ą lui parler.
Dieu sait si j'aimerais
trouver un moyen.
Je n'ai trouvé aucune banque
de ce nom.
J'ai un ami serrurier.
Il pourra y jeter un oeil.
Oł tu vas ?
A la pźche au requin.
<i>Au requin de l'usure...</i>
<i>J'avais l'impression d'źtre</i>
<i>en pleine guerre de gangs.</i>
<i>Je décidai de me déguiser en caļd</i>
<i>et d'aller voir le Roi des Clams.</i>
M. Faddas,
appelez-moi le pape.
Le pape ?
C'est pas une église, ici.
Andres, attends que j'aie fini
avec ce charlot.
Que puis-je pour vous,
M. le Pape ?
Pourquoi prźter 5 000 $
ą un type comme Argyle ?
Cette fouine ?
Vous lui avez confié
une collecte.
Qui a dit ēa ?
Lui.
Ecoutez-moi. Appelez-vous
comme vous voulez.
Je vous mets
les points sur les "i".
Argyle me doit un service.
Dites-moi oł il est
ou je vous flanque ą la baille.
Cliché, mais la baille est ą moi.
Je vous livre Argyle...
ą un prix.
Dix.
Vous źtes plein aux as.
Vingt.
Ca marche.
Oł sont mes cigares ?
M. Faddas,
je viens de chez Orlani.
J'y mange le vendredi.
Ils ont des humidificateurs.
C'est bon ?
L'osso buco est phénoménal.
J'aime pas trop le veau.
Ca me rappelle mon enfance.
<i>J'avais appris une chose :</i>
<i>Orlani était un restaurant.</i>
<i>Un autre restaurant.</i>
Je sentais que la clé
<i>- sans jeu de mots - du mystčre</i>
<i>était dans un humidificateur.</i>
<i>Je devais récupérer la clé,</i>
<i>mais Benny avait un autre plan.</i>
<i>Il était au courant, pour Orlani.</i>
<i>Pour aggraver le tout,</i>
<i>il avait décidé de prendre</i>
<i>l'affaire en main</i>
<i>pour aider son fils.</i>
<i>La guerre n'était pas finie.</i>
<i>Elle venait de commencer.</i>
<i>La guerre, c'est moche. Surtout</i>
<i>quand vos outils sont contre vous.</i>
<i>Bienvenue dans mon Waterloo.</i>
Je vous préviens, j'ai maté
des SS deux fois comme vous !
<i>Benny avait pris</i>
<i>l'affaire en main</i>
<i>et les Africains</i>
<i>allaient en prendre un doigt.</i>
Je ne ferais pas ēa.
<i>Ma cervelle était ma seule arme.</i>
<i>La meilleure, d'aprčs Sidney.</i>
Fichons le camp.
Rommel peut aller se rhabiller !
Le vol de l'enfer.
On va tourner encore 30 mn.
Vous pensez arriver ą temps
pour voir Thomas ?
Ca n'a pas d'importance.
Plus maintenant.
Par ici.
J'avais raison.
Il y a une pičce, derričre.
J'ai trouvé ēa.
C'était un atelier.
Il y a une belle lumičre.
Sans le mur,
la pičce sera plus claire.
Laissez le mur.
- Vous plaisantez ?
- Laissez-le.
Je m'envole pour Hawaļ
dans une heure.
Couvrez-le.
Vous saviez.
J'ai vu le nom
de votre mčre.
Katherine Parker.
C'était son atelier.
Vous saviez.
C'est moi qui ai construit le mur.
Laissez-le.
Il fallait me le dire.
Vous dire quoi ?
Que c'était son refuge,
qu'elle m'y lisait
des histoires en me coiffant ?
Je suis censée livrer
mon āme ą un étranger ?
Un étranger ? J'espérais źtre
au moins une connaissance.
Vous aviez tort.
Le revolver sert ą ēa ?
A écarter les étrangers ?
Votre vie en est remplie.
A commencer par elle.
Remontez le mur
en mon absence.
Comptez-y.
Je serai lą samedi...
pour vous payer.
Je l'ai laissé partir.
Il attendait lą,
que je le retienne,
et je l'ai laissé partir.
Votre réparateur a raison.
Il n'y a que des étrangers,
pour vous ?
On est dans le pétrin.
Cette vermine sévissait déją
avant votre naissance.
Faddas est un tueur.
Il ne vous lāchera pas.
C'est toi, la vermine.
Tu as menti ą Jarod.
Tu veux qu'il se batte
ą ta place ?
Je sais me défendre !
T'avais une bonne planque,
ą la guerre !
Ca suffit !
Ton pčre m'a menti
pour te débarrasser de Faddas.
Votre fils lui a emprunté du fric
pour vous emmener au Vatican.
Pour voir le chef ?
Si tu nous écoutais, un peu...
On voulait t'emmener voir le chef
avant que tu meures...
Vous n'avez rien ą dire
ą Argyle ?
Vous n'źtes pas malade.
Les médicaments ?
C'est du sucre.
Tu ne vas pas mourir ?
J'ai une idée.
Si on essayait les faits,
pour changer de la fiction ?
<i>C'était la 1re fois</i>
<i>qu'ils se taisaient</i>
<i>depuis mon arrivée.</i>
<i>Je savais d'oł venait ce silence.</i>
<i>A une autre époque,</i>
<i>une autre voix l'aurait comblé.</i>
On ne peut pas remplacer
une mčre.
Mais vous deux ?
Il ne faut pas vous lācher.
<i>C'était pour ēa</i>
<i>que j'avais quitté le Centre.</i>
<i>Mais ą quoi bon aider Benny</i>
<i>si Argyle se faisait tuer ?</i>
<i>C'est lą que les cigares</i>
<i>entraient en jeu.</i>
<i>Argyle pensait avoir tout prévu.</i>
J'ai tout pigé, mec.
Je me dis que ce type,
c'est le Cubain.
Il doit avoir de la famille
sur l'īle,
sous la houlette
du vilain dictateur Castro.
<i>Evidemment,</i>
<i>Argyle avait tout faux.</i>
<i>Faddas avait tué 2 coursiers</i>
<i>du Cubain</i>
<i>et avait piqué son fric.</i>
<i>Il lui fallait un coupable :</i>
<i>Argyle, que le contenu de la boīte</i>
<i>désignait un caļd surnommé...</i>
<i>Petit Joe de Chicago.</i>
<i>Le Cubain était censé</i>
<i>tuer Argyle ą la poubelle,</i>
<i>trouver la clé, la boīte</i>
<i>et son coupable.</i>
<i>Faddas en sortait blanchi,</i>
<i>avec l'argent du Cubain.</i>
Ils vivent comme des nababs
capitalistes ą Atlantic City.
Balčze, hein ?
T'as tout pigé.
<i>Restait une question :</i>
<i>oł étaient les coursiers ?</i>
<i>Je te flanque ą la baille.</i>
<i>Cliché, mais la baille est ą moi.</i>
<i>Faddas avait flanqué</i>
<i>les coursiers ą la baille.</i>
<i>C'était un cliché.</i>
<i>De la pire espčce.</i>
<i>Je réservais le mźme destin</i>
<i>ą Faddas.</i>
<i>C'était mon modus operandi,</i>
<i>depuis mon évasion.</i>
<i>Je me vengeais de ceux</i>
<i>qui écrasaient les petits.</i>
<i>Dans ce cas-lą,</i>
<i>l'un des plus petits sur Terre.</i>
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
C'est pas ce que tu crois.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je n'étais pas
en train de voler.
Je l'empruntais.
Pour faire ēa.
Le pape plastifié
m'a donné l'idée.
Elle sera protégée
des éléments.
Et toujours prčs de toi.
<i>C'était le plus beau cadeau</i>
<i>qu'on m'ait jamais fait.</i>
<i>Ma mission était de faire semblant</i>
<i>d'źtre l'ami d'Argyle.</i>
<i>Je ne faisais plus semblant.</i>
<i>Je lui avais donné rencard</i>
<i>ą 20 h ą la jetée.</i>
<i>Malheureusement,</i>
<i>les Africains l'avaient suivi.</i>
La voie est libre.
On peut y aller.
<i>Mais le gorille de Faddas</i>
<i>n'était pas d'accord.</i>
<i>Disons les gorilles.</i>
<i>Pluriel.</i>
<i>Les pieds d'Argyle</i>
<i>marchaient mieux que sa tźte.</i>
<i>Et les gorilles ?</i>
<i>Vous savez</i>
<i>e qu'ils me réservaient.</i>
Bonne chance, Parker.
Ca s'arrangera, avec Thomas.
Pas maintenant, Broots.
Vous voulez mon avis ? Foncez.
Vous avez écouté.
En partie.
Vous źtes tous des espions ?
Pour qui on travaille ?
Si je ressentais ēa
pour quelqu'un,
je lui dirais.
Au cours de ce vol,
on aurait pu y passer.
Il ne faut pas rater sa chance.
Merci du tuyau.
<i>De qui nous amčne ą la fin.</i>
<i>Pas la mienne, j'espčre.</i>
Debout, gros malin !
Réveille-toi,
tu vas faire trempette.
<i>Faddas avait coulé</i>
<i>une autre victime.</i>
<i>Mais j'avais tout prévu :</i>
<i>des Africains</i>
<i>ą la caméra installée</i>
<i>pour filmer tout ēa.</i>
<i>Mais le passe-partout,</i>
<i>je n'avais pas prévu</i>
<i>de le perdre.</i>
<i>Je rends grāce</i>
<i>ą mon renfort quadrupčde.</i>
Attends !
Attends-moi. Oł tu vas ?
Donne-moi ēa.
Tu veux ma photo ?
<i>Faddas avait invité le Cubain</i>
<i>ą fźter mon baptźme de l'eau.</i>
<i>Ils allaient manger</i>
<i>un osso buco.</i>
<i>Comme je l'ai dit,</i>
<i>je n'aime pas le veau.</i>
Pas un geste !
<i>Le Cubain n'a pas apprécié</i>
<i>mon histoire sur Faddas.</i>
<i>La police non plus.</i>
<i>Je lui ai dit</i>
<i>oł trouver Faddas,</i>
<i>les coursiers morts</i>
<i>et notre vidéo.</i>
On déconne pas avec le Gyle
et son assistant J-Rod !
C'est bien connu :
le crime ne paie pas.
Toi et moi, on fait la paire.
Vous źtes toujours
aussi ponctuelle ?
La tempźte...
On a dū tourner...
Vous n'aviez pas
demandé de porte.
Si vous voulez,
je remonte le mur.
Quels sont les dégāts ?
Mźme prix.
Pas de supplément.
Elle est fermée.
Mais si vous voulez l'ouvrir,
vous pouvez.
Je n'aurais pas dū mentir.
J'étais...
trčs jeune ą la mort de ma mčre.
Et ensuite...
je n'ai pas eu le courage
d'entrer dans cette pičce.
Maman et moi,
dans le temps,
on y passait des nuits
ą discuter.
C'était trčs beau
au clair de lune.
Elle avait
une vie trčs dure.
Cette pičce était son refuge.
Non, Parker.
C'était vous.
Mais vous l'avez oublié.
Vous avez condamné cette pičce
avec une partie de votre āme,
celle qui vient de votre mčre.
Retrouvez-la.
Je n'y arriverai pas seule.
Ca va aller.
Votre Sainteté,
c'est un trčs grand honneur.
Si seulement
mon Adella était lą...
Mais elle doit
nous regarder d'en haut.
Vous devez le savoir, chef.
Il est si... humain.
Il est pas plastifié.
Incroyable.
Argyle n'oubliera jamais.
Votre Altesse, vous pourriez dire
un mot aux gars de la boutique ?
Ils travaillent bien pour vous ?
On pourrait avoir une réduc ?
Vous devriez faire plastifier
vos missels.
Qu'en pensez-vous ?

NICE FELLOW
Vous avez
une assurance-incendie ?
De la sauce épicée
sur un gumbo aux piments !
Autant vous asseoir
sur une torche !
J'aime que ça soit pimenté.
Je vous apporte de l'eau.
Je devrais plutôt prendre
le tuyau d'arrosage !
Cela a été un plaisir.
Mais je devrais déjà
être couché,
il faut que je rentre.
Je n'aime pas qu'on m'arnaque.
"Arnaquer" !
Quel mot déplaisant !
Dominé, oui. Battu,
certainement.
Mais arnaqué !
Il n'y a plus
de joueurs fair-play.
Rappelez-moi un de ces jours,
d'accord ?
Que fait cet assassin ici ?
On n'arrête pas Eddie Fontenot.
Parfois,
mieux vaut voir le diable
qu'essayer de savoir où il est.
Tu sais que j'adore ça !
C'est pour toi, Marvin.
Ne tirez pas !
Tu as perdu la tête ?
On ne menace pas Fontenot
si on ne compte pas tirer.
Je voulais !
Bon sang, Earl !
Marvin était ton frère.
Il mérite mieux que ça.
Vous, mêlez-vous de vos affaires.
Merci pour votre aide.
Earl Dupree.
Jarod...
Pepper.
Je peux
savoir ce qui est arrivé
à votre frère ?
C'était il y a deux semaines.
Marvin était comme un père
pour Billie.
Elle l'adorait.
C'est elle qui l'a trouvé mort.
Dans la ruelle,
derrière le club.
Ca a dû être dur pour elle.
Marvin était un type bien.
Un vrai champion du billard.
Mais il s'est trompé de proie.
Le diable qui jouait au billard.
Il s'appelle Eddie Fontenot.
La police n'a pas pu prouver
qu'il avait tiré, mais...
Vous pensez qu'il l'a fait.
Marvin cherchait
à faire un gros coup.
De quoi payer
des cours de théâtre à Billie
et la mettre à l'abri du besoin.
Elle était sa vie. Il voulait
lui offrir un autre avenir.
Alors,
Eddie Fontenot
a proposé une partie de billard
à Marvin.
1000 $ la partie !
Un sacré paquet !
Forcément.
Les seuls Noirs à entrer chez
Fontenot ont un balai à la main.
Et alors ?
Marvin l'a battu
à plates coutures !
Il avait gagné 50 000 $
quand je suis revenu
pour fermer le club.
Si Fontenot a tué votre frère,
pourquoi l'admettez-vous ici ?
Ce club est tout ce que j'ai.
Il suffit
d'un appel de Fontenot pour que
je retrouve un tas de cendres !
Le moment est venu de l'arrêter.
Il n'y a qu'un seul moyen.
Lequel ?
Vous jouez au billard,
M. Pepper ?
Maintenant, oui.
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>à cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie</i>
<i>qui peut devenir qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>Il défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Où étais-tu passé ?
Je t'ai laissé
plein de messages.
Brigitte et moi,
on est partis à Aruba.
Très romantique.
Ta mère sera toujours
mon premier amour.
Elle m'a offert
ton frère et toi.
C'est irremplaçable.
Elle essaiera.
Une deuxième famille Parker.
Elle est stérile.
Tu en es sûr ?
Je sais où je mets les pieds.
J'ai vu son dossier médical.
A mon âge, je ne veux pas
d'enfant. Je suis déjà comblé.
Au fait, j'ai un service
à te demander.
On veut faire une réunion
de famille demain. Un dîner.
Pourquoi pas ?
Les travaux sont en cours.
On pourrait faire ça chez toi.
Je ne suis pas prête à recevoir.
Il n'y aura que la famille.
Et invite ton ami.
Comment s'appelle-t-il ?
Il est temps que je rencontre
celui qui courtise ma fille.
- Papa !
- 20 h précises.
Ne fais pas de folies !
Je t'adore.
C'est pas luxueux,
mais c'est propre.
Merci pour votre hospitalité.
On ne leur a pas toujours
facilité les choses.
Mais en dépit de tout,
Marvin adorait cette petite.
Ca se voit.
C'est elle.
La sérénité de la voix
et la turbulence du coeur.
<i>Quand tu penses à moi, j'espère</i>
<i>que ça te fait sourire.</i>
Vous chantez comme un ange.
Vous êtes encore là ?
M. Pepper
va rester quelque temps.
Tiens-toi bien.
Que voulez-vous vraiment,
M. Pepper ?
Je ne "veux" rien.
Et mon nom est Jarod.
Earl a dit que Marvin
était comme votre père.
Et votre vraie famille ?
Mon père est mort
quand j'étais bébé.
Ma mère est décédée
quelques années après.
Marvin était leur meilleur ami,
il m'a adoptée.
Vous avez eu de la chance.
Vous voyez cette photo ?
A l'école, j'ai eu le 1er rôle
dans My Fair Lady.
C'était un événement
car je suis en 2e année.
Marvin se lève dans le club
et dit à tout le monde
combien il est fier.
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,</i>
<i>Billie sera la vedette</i>
<i>du spectacle de son école.</i>
<i>Si vous l'entendiez chanter !</i>
<i>Elle a la voix d'or de sa mère.</i>
<i>Je suis fier de toi, Billie.</i>
Il voulait que je sois chanteuse,
comme ma mère.
Mais ce rêve est mort
dans la ruelle, avec lui.
Un rêve ne meurt
que si le rêveur l'accepte.
J'aimerais vous aider à découvrir
la vérité sur la mort de Marvin.
Comment ça ?
Si je peux arnaquer
Eddie Fontenot, comme Marvin,
je trouverai peut-être
des preuves.
Vous jouez au billard ?
Je connais bien la théorie
architecturale de la symétrie
et la théorie de Descartes
sur la géométrie analytique.
Lignes, angles...
Et les queues ?
Pardon ?
Rangez vos livres de maths,
M. Pepper.
Ils ne peuvent pas faire de vous
un joueur de billard.
Vous, oui.
Moi ?
Faites-le pour Marvin.
Choisissons une queue.
C'est pour vous. Vous voyez ?
Vos doigts.
Placez vos hanches en face
et allez-y.
- Pas mal.
- Ca va venir.
Vous devez penser
avec trois coups d'avance.
La neuf.
Le billard est un jeu mental.
Si votre adversaire pense à vous,
il a perdu.
Vous pouvez faire ça ?
A vous de me le dire.
J'ai été ravi.
Excusez-moi.
M. Fontenot vous offre à boire.
M. Pepper.
Je peux vous appeler Jarod ?
Vous savez mon nom ?
Je tiens à connaître
les gens intéressants.
Vous vouliez me voir ?
J'ai remarqué que vous jouiez
très bien au billard.
Et j'étais sûr
que vous sauriez apprécier ceci.
Richard Black. Modèle unique.
Revêtement d'ivoire
et incrustations d'or.
Ca m'a coûté 50 000 $.
Et ça joue à votre place ?
M'accorderiez-vous une partie,
pour le plaisir ?
Je ne joue jamais
pour le plaisir.
Une amie ?
La pauvre a été élevée
par un mauvais élément.
Un piranha.
Cet élément a été tué
et la rumeur m'accuse.
Asseyez-vous.
Non, merci.
C'est un bon joueur de billard.
<i>...devienne une oasis</i>
<i>de liberté et de justice.</i>
<i>J'ai fait un rêve...</i>
<i>Pourquoi détester quelqu'un</i>
<i>pour sa couleur ?</i>
<i>Je ne sais pas.</i>
<i>Ca s'appelle du racisme.</i>
<i>Pourquoi je dois regarder ça ?</i>
<i>Il faut que tu saches</i>
<i>ce qu'il y a de mal,</i>
<i>tout comme ce qui est bien.</i>
<i>Je rêve qu'un jour...</i>
<i>On leur apprend à faire ça ?</i>
<i>D'une certaine façon, oui.</i>
<i>Il n'existe pas</i>
<i>de solution simple au racisme.</i>
<i>Si : arrêter de haïr.</i>
<i>J'aimerais</i>
<i>que ça soit aussi simple.</i>
<i>Il faut</i>
<i>du temps et de la compassion.</i>
<i>Tu comprends, Jarod ?</i>
<i>Je comprends.</i>
<i>Mais je ne peux pas l'accepter.</i>
<i>Je rêve qu'un jour,</i>
<i>chaque vallée soit...</i>
<i>Jamais je ne l'accepterai.</i>
Cette anxiété
à cause de votre père
est compréhensible.
Symboliquement parlant, Brigitte
prend la place de votre mère.
Non... pas du tout.
Je suis entré chez Brigitte,
comme prévu.
Par effraction ?
Son dossier médical.
Votre père serait furieux
d'apprendre
que l'on cambriole sa fiancée.
Alors, ne lui disons rien.
Disséquez ce dossier.
Ne laissez rien de côté,
pas même un frottis.
Marvin était comme un père
pour Billie.
<i>Elle l'adorait.</i>
<i>Ancien nom :</i>
<i>Nom actuel :</i>
<i>Changement effectué</i>
<i>à la demande du père</i>
Marvin n'était pas
"comme un père", Billie.
C'était votre père.
Jarod ! D'où venez-vous ?
Je devrais demander ça
à Billie.
Hélas,
elle ne pourrait pas répondre.
Pourquoi avoir caché
que Marvin était son père ?
Comment ?
J'ai trouvé
son acte de naissance.
Pourquoi votre frère
le lui a caché ?
Il avait ses raisons.
Elle a le droit de savoir
qui elle est.
La mère de Billie.
Janice. Elle chantait au club.
Sa voix était comme du miel.
C'était une femme très bien.
Et elle était blanche.
Quand Marvin l'a rencontrée,
elle était fiancée
à un type de la région.
Mais ils sont tombés amoureux
l'un de l'autre.
Elle s'est enfuie
peu avant son mariage.
Au bout d'un an,
Billie est née.
Quand la famille de Janice
a su qu'elle avait eu
un enfant de Marvin,
ils lui ont dit
de prendre son enfant noir
et de ne jamais revenir.
Quand Janice est tombée malade,
elle a fait promettre à Marvin
de ne jamais dire à Billie
qu'il était son père.
Elle pensait que
ça rendrait le monde
moins cruel pour Billie,
si on pensait
que Marvin était un ami.
Il lui a donc menti.
Pour la protéger.
D'abord, l'apéritif.
Ensuite, le dîner. Ensuite,
je monte sur le toit
et je plonge la tête la première.
Une vieille tradition familiale.
Détends-toi, d'accord ?
Entre ton père et moi,
ça va rouler.
Rouler ?
Ca ne marchera jamais !
Sensationnelle !
On peut entrer ?
C'est déjà fait.
Merci d'organiser
cette petite sauterie.
Si vous saviez
comme les ouvriers sont lents !
Des crétins avec un marteau.
Papa, je te présente Thomas.
Le crétin d'ouvrier.
Mais j'ai laissé mon marteau.
J'ai beaucoup entendu
parler de vous.
Ne croyez pas
tout ce qu'on raconte.
Par exemple ?
J'espère ne pas être en retard.
Tommy, voici... mon frère, Lyle.
Enchanté.
Vous êtes le veinard
qui a conquis ma soeur.
Oui, je suis veinard.
Et votre pouce ?
Qui veut à boire ?
J'espère ne pas vous déranger.
J'espérais que vous,
M. Black et moi
pourrions jouer au billard.
- Je ne joue pas pour le plaisir.
- Je sais.
500 $ sur la 9.
Allons-y.
La 9 dans la poche
et vos 500 $ dans la mienne.
C'est ça, le billard, pas vrai ?
Parfois, les boules roulent
pour vous. Parfois, non.
Je vous invite à dîner.
J'ai une meilleure idée.
Je propose une revanche.
Pourquoi pas ce soir, chez moi ?
On peut augmenter la mise.
C'est trop pour vous ?
Je jouerai avec votre argent,
bien sûr.
Si vous pouvez supporter
cet affront, moi aussi.
Mon chauffeur
passera vous chercher.
J'irai à pied.
Ne vous baladez pas seul
dans ce quartier.
Vous risqueriez de mourir
près d'une poubelle, comme Marvin.
Pas vrai, Earl ?
Patience, Earl.
Chère famille...
et cher ami,
Brigitte et moi avons fixé
la date du mariage.
Ce week-end.
Fabuleux !
- Félicitations.
- Merci.
Pourquoi si vite ?
Parce que nous nous aimons.
Le temps passe très vite.
Autant en profiter.
Un toast !
Aux amoureux !
J'ai lu
le dossier médical de Brigitte.
C'est surtout gynécologique.
<i>C'est gênant.</i>
On n'est plus au lycée, Broots.
On est adultes.
Je vous écoute.
Tout semble coller.
Un certain Dr Noah Lindquist
l'a déclarée stérile
<i>pour cause de complications</i>
<i>liées à une endométrite.</i>
J'ai vérifié.
Aucun Noah Lindquist n'exerce
la médecine aux Etats-Unis
<i>ni ailleurs.</i>
Elle a tout inventé.
Il n'existe pas
et sa stérilité son plus.
<i>Que manigance-t-elle ?</i>
Je l'ignore.
Allez, mon ange !
On va jouer aux charades.
J'ai cru que ce dîner infernal
ne finirait jamais.
Voilà de quoi t'aider à dormir.
Je croyais que ça s'était
plutôt bien passé.
Il n'y a pas eu de mort.
Brigitte a l'air... très gentille.
Et elle rend ton père heureux.
C'est dur de le voir
gâcher sa vie comme ça.
Alors, oublie-les.
Si ça te fait souffrir,
ne les vois plus.
C'est ma famille.
Tu devrais songer
à fonder la tienne.
<i>C'est elle qui l'a trouvé mort.</i>
<i>Dans la ruelle,</i>
<i>derrière le club.</i>
<i>Marvin se lève et dit à tous</i>
<i>combien il est fier de moi.</i>
<i>Mais ce rêve est mort</i>
<i>dans la ruelle, avec lui.</i>
Voyons s'il joue
toujours aussi bien !
Où suis-je ?
Chez moi.
Je vous avais prévenu
pour le quartier.
Heureusement
que mon chauffeur est arrivé.
Vous auriez pu mourir.
Je m'estime heureux.
Je suis content pour vous.
Jouons au billard.
Courageuse tentative !
Mais comme disait Hamlet :
"Pour son courage,
"je le respecte.
"Pour son ambition...
"je le tue."
C'est Brutus qui a dit ça.
Pour se justifier
d'avoir tué César.
Mais il a vu qu'on ne justifiait
pas un meurtre de sang-froid.
Et il s'est tué.
Si Brutus avait réfléchi,
il aurait trouvé une solution.
Inutile d'être un génie
pour savoir
que seuls les forts
survivent dans ce monde.
Et les autres
doivent être éliminés ?
Comme Marvin Dupree ?
Marvin ne savait pas
où était sa place. Il l'a payé.
Et où était exactement
"sa place" ?
Au fond du bus, naturellement !
<i>- Jamais je ne l'accepterai.</i>
<i>- Le racisme...</i>
Vous me devez encore 1000 $.
Vous faites des travaux ?
Ca sent la peinture fraîche.
Et vous avez fait changer
la moquette.
J'aime que ma maison
soit présentable.
Pour les invités de marque,
comme vous.
Une autre partie ?
Pas ce soir.
Parfois, les boules roulent
pour vous. Parfois, non.
Et si on rejouait demain ?
Quand mes deux bras
fonctionneront.
A moins que vous n'aimiez pas
les risques.
D'accord.
Parfait. A demain.
Dans l'après-midi, chez Earl.
J'aimerais aller aux toilettes.
Aucun problème.
A gauche, au fond du couloir.
C'est un album peu ordinaire.
Après la mort de Marvin,
j'ai accumulé tout ce que
j'ai pu sur Fontenot
pour essayer de comprendre
comment un homme
pouvait tuer,
purement par haine.
J'ai trouvé la réponse dans
un vieux journal de Huntsville.
J'ai vu cette photo encadrée
chez Fontenot.
Le père de Fontenot...
Robes blanches, croix enflammées.
Le père de Fontenot
appartenait au Ku Klux Klan.
Selon des gens avisés.
J'ai visité
la maison de Fontenot ce soir.
Il a fait reboucher deux traces
de balle dans un mur.
Et il a changé la moquette.
Pour cacher le sang de Marvin ?
Il essayait
de cacher quelque chose.
Mais ce n'est pas le seul.
Vous avez dit
que la mère de Billie avait
quitté son fiancé pour Marvin.
Exact.
Mais vous avez oublié
un détail important.
Vous avez dit que Marvin
était le père de Billie,
mais pas que le fiancé,
c'était Eddie Fontenot.
Marvin était mon père ?
Marvin était mon père.
Assez de mensonges !
Je n'ai pas été aussi nerveux
depuis votre naissance,
à ton frère et toi.
Il faut que je te dise
quelque chose... sur Brigitte.
Tu lui en veux.
Mais les gens changent.
Regarde-nous,
tous chics pour mon mariage !
Je n'avais pas été si heureux
depuis longtemps.
Essaie d'être heureuse pour moi,
mon ange.
Ce que tu es jolie !
Te voilà !
Allons-y.
Je ne peux pas faire attendre
la mariée.
5 pour Jarod, 5 pour Fontenot.
Réussissez ce coup
et vous avez gagné, Jarod.
Vous n'avez pas encore gagné,
M. Pepper.
Je sens déjà les 50 000 $
dans ma poche !
Je commence à croire
que ça ne suffit pas.
On devrait jouer plus gros.
50 000 $ ne vous suffisent pas ?
Je ne parlais d'argent,
mais d'un bien plus précieux.
Par exemple... l'honneur.
Après tout, c'est ce que
Marvin Dupree
vous a fait perdre, non ?
Je ne comprends rien à tout ça.
Ce n'est pas
pour une partie perdue
ou parce que Marvin Dupree
vous a pris de l'argent
que vous l'avez tué.
Vous l'avez tué
à cause de la couleur
de sa peau.
Vous ne pouviez plus contenir
votre haine !
Qui êtes-vous ?
Une haine puissante,
même pour un sectaire comme vous.
Car votre fiancée
est partie avec un Noir.
Vous ne savez rien.
Je sais que les photos
ne mentent jamais.
Vous deviez épouser
la mère de Billie,
avant qu'elle ne parte
avec Marvin Dupree.
Puis il y a eu cette fameuse
partie de billard contre Marvin
où vous avez perdu l'honneur
dans la maison
de votre propre père.
C'en était trop pour vous.
Ce type a eu ce qu'il méritait.
C'était un homme.
Et ce qu'il a eu,
c'est votre fiancée.
Je trouve qu'ils forment
un beau couple.
Pas vous ?
Ca suffit. On s'en va.
Pas vous ?
Que faites-vous ?
Pas vous ?
J'attends une réponse, Fontenot.
Oui, un beau couple !
Billie, non !
- Laissez-moi !
- Il a raison !
Toi aussi, Earl.
Même Dieu ne le sauvera pas.
Avouez.
Dites que vous avez tué
mon père.
Elle est folle !
- J'écoute !
- Parlez-lui !
Je veux vous l'entendre dire !
Oui, je l'ai tué !
J'ai tué Marvin !
Et je tuerais à nouveau
cet animal si je pouvais.
Poussez-vous, Jarod.
Je vous en prie.
Votre père approuverait ça ?
Que la haine s'arrête ici,
Billie.
Nous sommes ici
pour unir ce couple
par les liens sacrés du mariage.
Brigitte, acceptez-vous
de prendre cet homme pour époux,
pour le meilleur et pour le pire,
jusqu'à ce que la mort
vous sépare ?
Oui.
Et vous...
M. Parker, acceptez-vous
de prendre cette femme
pour épouse,
pour le meilleur et pour le pire,
jusqu'à ce que la mort
vous sépare ?
Oui.
L'alliance.
Si quelqu'un s'oppose
à l'union de ces deux personnes,
qu'il parle maintenant...
ou se taise à jamais.
Par les pouvoirs
qui me sont investis,
je vous déclare mari et femme.
Vous pouvez embrasser la mariée.
Félicitations, Mme Parker.
Je vous souhaite
beaucoup de bonheur.
Merci, M. Raines.
Je ferai tout ce qui est
en mon pouvoir
pour rendre
ses vieilles années mémorables.
En tout cas,
elles le seront pour moi.
Comptez-y.
Je vais prendre du gâteau.
Quelle belle cérémonie !
Bravo pour le voile virginal !
Vous voulez un conseil maternel ?
A ce propos,
parlons de contraception.
Comme l'a fait le Dr Lindquist
avec vous.
Vous vous souvenez de lui, non ?
Peut-être que non,
puisqu'il n'existe pas.
Je vois qu'il y a
une fouine affairée.
Mal informée, mais affairée.
Vous avez menti à mon père
sur votre stérilité.
Si vous tombez enceinte, ce sera
dur de se débarrasser de vous.
Mon mari et moi,
nous nous faisons confiance.
Juste...
une question.
Quel monstre utilise le miracle
de la vie pour son ambition ?
Un bébé de votre père
serait un enfant de l'amour.
Rien de plus, rien de moins.
Mais vous avez raison
sur un point.
Si jamais il y avait un enfant,
ce serait vraiment un miracle.
<i>Fontenot</i>
<i>accusé du meurtre de Dupree</i>
Je vous remercie tous
d'être venus
par cette froide soirée.
Nous avons un cadeau pour vous.
- Je ne peux pas !
- Bien sûr que si.
Gardez votre père
dans votre coeur et tout ira bien.
Je vous demande
d'applaudir chaleureusement
Mlle Billie Dupree.
Je voudrais dédier cette chanson
à mon père,
Marvin Dupree,
et à celui qui m'a aidée
à le retrouver.
Merci, Jarod.

Mlle Parker...

Ca va ?
Parker, vous m'entendez ?
Elle est tombée d'un coup !
Mon Dieu !
- Elle est brűlante.
- C'est le choc.
Il faut l'emmener ŕ l'hôpital.

<i>Je suppose.</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est ?</i>
<i>Il y a un cadavre au Centre.</i>
<i>Un cadavre ?</i>
<i>Oů ça ?</i>
<i>Ce matin, on a apporté</i>
<i>un cercueil au Dr Raines.</i>
<i>Dans la zone d'endiguement.</i>
<i>J'ai entendu Sidney</i>
<i>parler de cet endroit.</i>
<i>Il s'y passe plein de choses,</i>
<i>mais je ne sais pas oů c'est.</i>
<i>Moi non plus.</i>
<i>J'ai interrogé papa</i>
<i>sur le cercueil et le cadavre.</i>
<i>Il a refusé de répondre.</i>
<i>Depuis quelques semaines...</i>
<i>depuis la mort de maman,</i>
<i>il est trop occupé</i>
<i>pour me parler.</i>
<i>J'ai du mal ŕ croire</i>
<i>qu'elle est partie.</i>
<i>Je suis désolé.</i>
<i>Ca va.</i>
<i>Si papa ne me dit pas oů est</i>
<i>le cadavre, je le trouverai.</i>
<i>Il faudrait suivre le Dr Raines</i>
<i>ŕ son insu.</i>
<i>Viens, on va le chercher.</i>
<i>Qui a dit</i>
<i>que je le ferais ?</i>
<i>Tu as peur ?</i>
<i>C'est seulement que...</i>
<i>je n'ai jamais vu de mort.</i>
<i>Il ne peut rien te faire.</i>
<i>Plus rien.</i>
<i>J'ai surtout peur du Dr Raines.</i>
<i>Je déteste les médecins.</i>
Elle a perdu beaucoup de sang.
- Le temps presse.
- On peut y aller.
Pręts ? Allons-y.
Il faudrait un miracle
pour qu'elle survive.
<i>C'est comment, de mourir ?</i>
<i>Demande ŕ Raines.</i>
<i>Il a l'air d'ętre mort</i>
<i>depuis longtemps.</i>
<i>Viens, essayons</i>
<i>de trouver le mort.</i>
<i>C'est drôle.</i>
<i>La mort nous touche tous,</i>
<i>mais personne ne veut en parler.</i>
<i>Quand maman est morte,</i>
<i>tous les adultes</i>
<i>venaient me parler</i>
<i>de tout, sauf ce dont</i>
<i>je voulais parler.</i>
<i>De ce qui lui était arrivé.</i>
<i>Il est passé par ici.</i>
<i>Que fera-t-on du cercueil ?</i>
<i>On l'ouvrira.</i>
<i>Je me demande ce qu'on verra.</i>
<i>Et si c'est quelqu'un qui</i>
<i>a été mutilé dans un accident ?</i>
<i>Peut-ętre que le Centre</i>
<i>a voulu s'en débarrasser.</i>
<i>Peut-ętre que le Dr Raines</i>
<i>a créé une sorte</i>
<i>de monstre comme</i>
<i>Frankenstein.</i>
<i>Qui ça ?</i>
<i>Il revient !</i>
<i>- Que faire ?</i>
<i>- Je ne sais pas !</i>
<i>Qui est lŕ ?</i>
<i>Merci, Angelo.</i>
<i>Faith</i>
<i>attend.</i>
<i>On a eu chaud !</i>
<i>Ne fais pas dans ta culotte !</i>
<i>On dirait que tu vas t'évanouir.</i>
C'est le bouquet.
Fiche le camp !
<i>Quelqu'un m'entend ?</i>
<i>C'est une urgence. Terminé.</i>
Ici la patrouille de secours.
Répondez.
Ici Charlie-Victor.
Mon avion s'est écrasé
<i>dans une rivičre.</i>
<i>J'ai besoin d'aide.</i>
Vous ętes blessé ?
<i>J'ai l'épaule démise</i>
<i>et des côtes cassées.</i>
<i>J'ai besoin de soins.</i>
Compris.
Il y a d'autres survivants ?
Je suis seul.
Vous m'entendez ?
<i>Terminé. Allô ?</i>
<i>Ici la patrouille de secours.</i>
<i>Je vous reçois mal.</i>
Il va faire froid.
Oů ętes-vous ?
- Répondez.
<i>- Je n'en suis pas sűr.</i>
J'étais ŕ environ
50 km d'oů, Charlie-Victor ?
J'entends mal.
Répondez, Charlie-Victor.
Je l'ai perdu.
Sans doute pour de bon.
Personne ne survivrait
ŕ une nuit dehors.
Personne.
Allô, vous m'entendez ?
Est-ce que quelqu'un m'entend ?
Est-ce que quelqu'un m'entend ?
<i>Non, c'est Broots.</i>
Je suis ŕ l'hôpital.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Jarod n'a pas appelé.
Ca m'étonne de lui.
Et Mlle Parker ?
<i>Je ne sais pas.</i>
Elle est en unité
de soins intensifs.
Je voudrais aller la voir,
mais c'est interdit.
Elle est seule.
<i>Ne bougez pas, Broots.</i>
J'arrive.
On ne devrait pas ętre seul
dans ces moments-lŕ.
Allume-toi.
Ne me laisse pas tomber.
Vous semblez avoir froid.
C'est bizarre, vous ętes
toujours dure avec moi.
Pas par méchanceté.
Vous ętes comme ça, c'est tout.
J'ai toujours pu compter
sur vous en cas de besoin.
Vous ne m'entendez sűrement pas.
Mais je veux que vous sachiez...
qu'ŕ part Debbie...
je me sens plus proche de vous...
que de n'importe qui d'autre.
Vous ne pouvez pas m'abandonner.
N'ayez pas peur.
N'ayez pas peur, Mlle Parker.
<i>N'aie pas peur.</i>
<i>Je n'ai pas peur.</i>
<i>Je veux juste savoir oů on va.</i>
<i>Mlle Parker...</i>
<i>a besoin de Faith.</i>
<i>Tu ne comprends pas, Angelo.</i>
<i>On doit trouver le cadavre.</i>
<i>Regarde !</i>
<i>C'est ça.</i>
<i>C'est quoi ?</i>
<i>Lŕ oů ils gardent le cadavre.</i>
<i>Faith !</i>
<i>C'est drôle d'ętre ici.</i>
<i>On ne devrait pas y ętre.</i>
<i>Viens, allons-nous-en.</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?</i>
<i>Rien. Ca me rappelle...</i>
<i>Peu importe.</i>
<i>Mais tu voulais voir !</i>
<i>Ca n'est pas le bon moment.</i>
<i>Tu as peur ?</i>
<i>Je ne sais pas.</i>
<i>Viens.</i>
Tu as faim ?
Moi aussi. Tu vas devoir
m'attendre encore un peu.
Alors ?
Elle a perdu beaucoup de sang.
Elle a de la température.
Le médecin
dit qu'elle a une péritonite.
C'est mauvais.
Ils disent
qu'elle risque d'y rester.
Si je pouvais
faire quelque chose !
Vous le faites déjŕ, Broots.
Désolée, je dois
vous demander de partir.
Elle a besoin de repos.
Faith...
- Faith...
- Ca va aller.
Elle n'arręte pas
de dire "Faith".
C'est ce qu'a dit Angelo.
En voyant le rosaire
que Jarod a envoyé.
Juste avant qu'elle s'évanouisse.
Ca signifie quoi ?
Je n'en suis pas sűr.
Mais je crois me souvenir
qu'il y a eu un projet,
il y a longtemps,
dont le nom de code
était "Faith".
On doit aller au Centre.
Maintenant ?
Jarod a dű avoir
un accident d'avion.
J'ai besoin de vous
pour découvrir
oů il s'est écrasé.
Si jamais son état changeait...
J'ai vos numéros.
Je vous appellerai.
Vous ne pouvez rien faire.
Tout dépend d'elle, maintenant.
Faith...
Je dois trouver...
Faith.
C'est une fille.
Elle est belle.
Tu n'es pas morte.
Vous non plus.
Mais...
Peu importe.
Je m'appelle Mlle Parker.
Plutôt strict !
Moi, c'est Faith.
Mon nom est Jarod.
Voici Angelo. Il parle peu.
Que fais-tu ici ?
J'ai été malade.
Trčs trčs malade.
Je suis lŕ pour me rétablir.
Je n'ai jamais vu
d'autres enfants ici.
Ils habitent ici.
Mon pčre travaille ici.
Mais en fait,
je suis souvent seule.
Moi aussi,
j'ai l'habitude d'ętre seule.
Mais je ne le suis plus.
Et si on jouait ensemble ?
On pourrait
ętre amies !
J'aimerais bien.
Mauvais.
Quelqu'un vient !
On n'est pas censés ętre ici.
Je ne le dirai ŕ personne.
Mais on reviendra, d'accord ?
- Viens.
- Je reviendrai !
Moi, je reste ici.
Presque.
Tu sais,
je n'ai jamais eu d'amie.
Je veux dire d'amie fille.
J'ai hâte que Faith guérisse
et qu'on joue ensemble.
Faith
n'est pas simplement malade.
Elle est trčs malade.
Comment ça ?
J'ai lu son dossier.
Elle est condamnée.
Je ne veux pas qu'elle meure.
Ni elle ni personne !
Je vous salue, Marie,
pleine de grâce.
Vous ętes bénie entre toutes
les femmes et Jésus est béni.
Priez pour nous,
pauvres pécheurs,
maintenant
et ŕ l'heure de notre mort.
Je vous salue, Marie,
pleine de grâce.
Vous ętes bénie entre toutes
les femmes et Jésus est béni.
Sainte Marie, priez pour nous,
pauvres pécheurs,
maintenant
et ŕ l'heure de notre mort.
Ni pouls ni respiration !
10 cm3 d'adrénaline,
tout de suite.
Défibrillation !
On commence ŕ 100.
Allons-y !
<i>Ca va ?</i>
<i>Je crois.</i>
<i>Viens.</i>
<i>Elle... dort ?</i>
<i>Vous l'avez vue ?</i>
<i>Qui ?</i>
<i>Ma maman.</i>
<i>Elle était lŕ.</i>
<i>Il n'y a personne.</i>
<i>J'ai dű ręver.</i>
<i>Mais c'était tellement réel...</i>
<i>On riait,</i>
<i>on parlait</i>
<i>de ce qu'on allait faire.</i>
<i>Je n'étais plus...</i>
<i>vous savez...</i>
<i>plus malade.</i>
<i>Comment tu te sens ?</i>
<i>Mieux depuis que vous ętes lŕ.</i>
<i>Tiens.</i>
<i>C'était ŕ ma mčre.</i>
<i>Maintenant, c'est ŕ moi.</i>
<i>Elle disait</i>
<i>qu'il fallait que je le tienne</i>
<i>et que je pense ŕ elle</i>
<i>dčs que j'avais peur</i>
<i>ou que j'étais triste.</i>
<i>C'est comme si...</i>
<i>je la sentais prčs de moi.</i>
<i>Et en un rien de temps,</i>
<i>je n'ai plus peur,</i>
<i>je ne suis plus seule.</i>
<i>Je me sens toujours mieux.</i>
<i>Merci d'ętre mon amie.</i>
<i>Je serai toujours votre amie.</i>
<i>Je serai toujours lŕ pour vous,</i>
<i>je veillerai sur vous,</i>
<i>comme ma maman.</i>
<i>Maman...</i>
<i>C'est fini.</i>
<i>Je t'en prie, Faith !</i>
<i>Ne m'abandonne pas !</i>
<i>Je t'en prie !</i>
<i>Ils vont arriver.</i>
<i>Faut... partir.</i>
<i>Je t'ai dit</i>
<i>que je veillerais sur toi.</i>
<i>Tu dois te battre,</i>
<i>n'abandonne pas.</i>
<i>Ton heure n'a pas encore sonné.</i>
<i>Ta maman t'aime beaucoup.</i>
<i>Elle veut que tu te battes.</i>
200. Encore une fois.
<i>Ta maman t'aime beaucoup.</i>
<i>Beaucoup...</i>
<i>Maman !</i>
<i>Apprends-moi</i>
<i>ŕ natter mes cheveux.</i>
Ca y est !
C'est une battante.
<i>Tu ne peux pas abandonner, Jarod.</i>
Je ne comprends pas.
<i>Tiens bon.</i>
<i>Ils ne vont pas tarder.</i>
<i>N'abandonne pas.</i>
Pas encore.
Tu ne m'auras pas...
pour le moment.
Tiens bon.
Bientôt, il fera jour.
Tiens bon.
- Des nouvelles de Mlle Parker ?
- Rien.
Mais son pčre va arriver.
Il a appris
ce qui s'était passé.
J'ai trouvé quelque chose.
Profondément
enfoui dans les archives.
Faith !
Qui est-ce ?
Une fillette qui était ici
il y a longtemps.
Mais le dossier est incomplet.
On a voulu masquer la vérité.
Du nouveau sur Jarod ?
Grâce ŕ la carte de Yellowstone
et ŕ la localisation
du dernier appel de Jarod,
j'ai calculé
qu'il devait ętre par ici.
Il faudrait
des jours de recherches !
Pas forcément.
J'ai eu la patrouille de secours.
Ils ont reçu un appel
de cette zone,
mais ils ont perdu le contact.
Ce doit ętre Jarod.
J'ai mis en corrélation
mes données et la localisation
de la station de la patrouille.
Il doit ętre ici,
le long de cette rivičre.
Appelez la patrouille.
Pourvu qu'il ne soit pas
trop tard.
Son état est stable.
Patience.
Merci, mademoiselle.
Faith...
Oů es-tu ?
<i>Ca va aller ?</i>
<i>Je crois.</i>
<i>Oů est-elle partie ?</i>
<i>Je ne sais pas.</i>
<i>Au moins,</i>
<i>elle n'est pas morte seule.</i>
<i>Je me demande si on la reverra.</i>
<i>Elle a dit</i>
<i>qu'elle veillerait sur nous.</i>
<i>Elle me manque.</i>
<i>Je ne sais męme pas</i>
<i>qui c'était !</i>
Je suis soulagé !
Mon ange !
Qui est Faith ?
Faith...
était ta soeur.
<i>Quelle affreuse façon</i>
<i>de mourir !</i>
<i>M. Parker, on va venir</i>
<i>nous débarrasser du cadavre.</i>
<i>Vous n'avez aucune compassion,</i>
<i>Raines ?</i>
<i>Trouvez le prętre de Catherine.</i>
<i>Le pčre Moore.</i>
<i>Je veux qu'il s'occupe de tout.</i>
<i>Le pčre Moore ?</i>
<i>Je me méfie de lui.</i>
<i>On ignore ce que Catherine</i>
<i>a pu lui dire.</i>
<i>Vous ne comprenez pas.</i>
<i>Les volontés de Catherine</i>
<i>seront respectées.</i>
<i>Le corps</i>
<i>ira au pčre Moore.</i>
<i>La discussion est close !</i>
<i>Seigneur !</i>
<i>Personne ne devrait mourir seul.</i>
Tu ne m'auras pas encore !
Par ici !
Il est vivant !
Ca alors !
Pourquoi tu ne m'as pas parlé
de Faith ?
Je ne t'ai rien dit parce que
je savais qu'elle allait mourir.
Aprčs la mort de ta mčre...
je ne pouvais pas t'en parler.
On avait assez souffert.
C'était
ma soeur ?
Etant orpheline,
elle était pupille de la nation.
Elle était atteinte de leucémie.
Le médecin a dit
qu'on ne pouvait rien faire.
On l'a mise en maison de repos...
pour qu'elle y meure.
Comment s'est-elle retrouvée
au Centre ?
Le prętre de ta mčre
lui a parlé d'elle.
Ils sont allés la voir.
Ta mčre a dit que tu aurais pu
ętre ŕ sa place,
qu'il fallait qu'elle fasse
quelque chose.
Et vous l'avez adoptée ?
Avec l'aide du pčre Moore,
on l'a ramenée au Centre
pour que Catherine
puisse ętre avec elle.
On lui a donné un traitement
expérimental créé par le Centre.
Ce traitement est devenu efficace
grâce ŕ Faith.
Elle est morte
peu aprčs Catherine.
Il y a des gens qui aimeraient
vous voir.
On nous a dit
que vous aviez repris
connaissance.
J'ai pensé
que vous aimeriez avoir ceci.
Merci.
A plus tard.
Quoi ? Jarod ?
On l'a retrouvé.
Je suis ravi de vous voir enfin.
Je suis le pčre Moore.
Comment m'avez-vous trouvé ?
Je m'inquiétais
de ne pas vous voir arriver.
Vous sembliez avoir hâte
qu'on se voie
quand vous avez appelé.
Notre ami commun au Centre
m'a dit oů je pourrais
vous trouver.
- Le Centre ?
- N'ayez crainte.
Le Centre ignore oů vous ętes
et oů nous allons.
Merci... pour votre aide.
C'est ce qu'aurait voulu
Catherine Parker.
J'avais oublié
combien il était beau.
Comment l'as-tu retrouvé ?
Par un ami de ta mčre.
Le pčre Moore.
<i>Il a trouvé le rosaire</i>
<i>entre les mains de Faith.</i>
<i>Il savait que ta mčre y tenait</i>
et voulait que je te le donne.
Merci, Jarod.
Il t'arrive de penser ŕ elle ?
<i>Je pense toujours ŕ elle.</i>
C'est ironique.
<i>Quoi donc ?</i>
A l'époque, toi et moi,
on était en quęte de mort
et on a trouvé quelqu'un
qui nous a sauvé la vie.
Je jurerais
qu'elle était ŕ l'hôpital.
Et je jurerais
qu'elle était sur la montagne.
<i>Elle a promis</i>
de veiller sur nous.
Elle l'a fait.
Est-ce qu'on est fous ?
<i>J'ignore ce qui s'est passé.</i>
Mais je suis sűr d'une chose.
L'amour
transcende la mort.
<i>Ceux qu'on aime</i>
<i>touchent notre vie...</i>
męme aprčs leur mort.

NICE FELLOW
Et voilŕ !
Doucement, Matthew.
Salut, Joe.
Salut, Rachel.
Je suis désolé.
T'inquičte. Dans toute sortie
en car, il faut que quelqu'un...
Comment, déjŕ ?
"Dégobille."
Je ne comprends pas.
Je suis fauché.
Vous débarquez
pour réparer ce car
et vous emmenez les petits
ŕ la base aérienne.
Mieux vaut donner que recevoir.
J'ai lu ça. Quelque part.
Ton pčre a aimé la base ?
Le pčre de Ryan n'a pas pu venir.
Un voyage d'affaires.
Mais c'était bien.
Vous ętes une bénédiction.
Il manque plus que McMahon
rapplique avec un gros chčque.
Voilŕ ma mčre.
Qui est McMahon ?
Un cadeau.
- Cool ! Merci.
- En attendant d'ętre pilote.
Surtout, merci d'avoir été
mon pčre ce week-end.
- C'était bien ?
- Fantastique !
Maman, c'est Jarod.
Cindy Wells. Enchantée.
Il ne parle que de vous.
Il m'a donné ça.
Je peux attendre papa
ce soir ?
On verra.
Retour au cockpit, Top Gun.
A bientôt, Jarod.
Merci. Son pčre voulait venir,
mais il a été retenu...
Il manque beaucoup ŕ Ryan.
Je m'en doute.
C'est un garçon épatant.
- Enchanté.
- Moi aussi.
Appelez les secours !
<i>On m'a enlevé ŕ ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjŕ</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>ŕ cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>Il défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous ętes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Mon fils et ma femme
sont ici.
M. Wells ?
Je m'appelle Jarod.
J'ai vu l'accident.
Ils sont au bloc.
Je viens de rentrer.
J'ai été retenu.
Vous ętes lŕ, maintenant.
- M. Wells ?
- C'est moi.
- Alors ?
- Votre femme s'en tirera.
Une légčre commotion
et une épaule démise.
Mon fils ?
Il a subi un grave choc abdominal.
Les reins étaient touchés.
On en a enlevé un.
L'autre
ne durera pas longtemps.
Il a besoin d'une greffe.
Sinon, il mourra.
Nous avons 48 heures.
Expliquez-moi.
Ryan est sur liste prioritaire ?
En principe.
Son sang contient
un composé glucosidique rare.
C'est héréditaire.
Il y a peu de donneurs.
Votre femme n'en est pas.
Alors, mettez-moi sur le billard.
Il faut d'abord stabiliser Ryan
et vous faire une analyse de sang.
Je vous envoie quelqu'un.
Je ne peux pas les perdre.
Pardonne-moi.
D'ętre un mauvais frčre.
Parce que tu n'es pas venu
quand j'étais ŕ l'hosto,
ŕ l'article de la mort ?
Tu es dur avec toi-męme !
Je sais que tu m'en veux.
C'est normal.
Je t'ai apporté ça.
Des escargots en chocolats ?
- Miam, miam !
- Ils sont rares.
Sans rire !
Oů étais-tu passé ?
J'ai eu 3 pistes sur Jarod.
Tu t'en fiches ?
J'ai d'autres responsabilités.
Il n'y a pas que Jarod.
M. Lyle, le type
du téléphone est lŕ.
J'arrive.
Il a d'autres clients.
J'arrive !
Le type du téléphone ?
Grosse responsabilité !
Régale-toi.
<i>A ce soir !</i>
C'est mon nounours.
Vous ętes bien souriante.
On m'espionne ?
- On travaille ?
- Je suis sur écoute ?
Un mal nécessaire,
vu vos récents échecs.
Venez-en au fait.
Votre travail manque
de concentration.
Seriez-vous distraite
par des affaires personnelles ?
Telles que ?
Telles que...
Excusez-moi.
Restez, Broots.
Raines ne faisait que passer,
n'est-ce pas ?
Les priorités, Mlle Parker.
Les priorités.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
J'ai une nouvelle parabole.
223 chaînes de télé
en haute définition.
Je zappais sous la douche...
Vous avez une télé
dans la salle de bains ?
Pas vous ?
Sur la chaîne "catastrophes",
ils passaient des trains...
Ca déraille.
Venez-en au fait !
Attendez... Je vais vous montrer.
<i>La crise touche męme</i>
<i>cette petite église de banlieue.</i>
<i>"On ne survit que grâce aux dons",</i>
<i>dit le révérend Collins.</i>
<i>Pour aider le révérend...</i>
Envoyez-leur la monnaie
dans mon tiroir.
Vous l'avez raté.
Ici.
Alléluia !
Regardez qui a vu la lumičre.
- Tu veux quelque chose ?
- Mon avion.
Celui-ci ?
Comment tu te sens ?
Fatigué.
J'ai mal au côté.
Quand tu iras mieux,
on le fera voler.
Ferme un peu les yeux.
Tu as besoin de repos.
Ted ?
Des nouvelles de la greffe ?
J'allais demander
des nouvelles au labo.
J'y vais.
Restez avec votre famille.
J'ignore votre intéręt
dans tout ça,
mais j'apprécie votre aide.
Je sais que c'est urgent,
mais je manque de main-d'oeuvre.
Mon associé s'est fait porter pâle
et son remplaçant
n'est pas encore arrivé.
Je sais.
Désolé d'ętre en retard.
Il vient d'arriver.
Je me suis perdu.
Besoin d'une pause ?
Et comment !
Avec l'accident de chantier,
toutes les analyses
sont pour hier.
Faites une pause.
Je me mets au travail.
Vous ętes un chou.
Détendez-vous.
Cindy ?
Oů est Ted ?
Il appelle mes parents.
Pourquoi les résultats
tardent tant ?
Venez dans le couloir.
Il y a un problčme au labo ?
Votre mari n'est pas donneur.
C'est impossible.
Dites-moi la vérité.
Ted n'est pas le pčre de Ryan ?
J'en avais peur,
mais je n'étais pas sűre.
Je sais que c'est dur,
mais pour sauver votre fils,
je dois savoir qui est son pčre.
Il s'appelle Luther Ecksley.
Je l'ai rencontré
aprčs avoir connu Ted.
C'est le contraire de Ted.
Il est dangereux, sombre...
J'avais vu Ted
avec une autre
et je suis sortie avec Luther
pour le récupérer.
Vous étiez avec lui ?
C'était une passade.
J'étais jeune.
Je suis vite retournée
vers Ted.
Mais vous étiez enceinte.
Vous ne lui avez rien dit ?
Mille fois,
j'ai voulu le faire.
Mais je ne l'ai pas fait,
de peur de le perdre.
Plus le temps passait,
moins ça importait.
Ryan est le fils de Ted
ŕ tous les égards.
Je dois trouver Luther.
Vous savez oů il est ?
Aucune idée.
Il avait des ennuis.
Il a peut-ętre un casier
judiciaire. C'est un début.
Ne dites rien ŕ Ted.
Vous ne pourrez pas
garder le secret.
Les médecins
sauront bientôt la vérité.
<i>Police de San Diego</i>
<i>Recherche : Ecksley, Luther</i>
<i>Attaque ŕ main armée,</i>
<i>kidnapping...</i>
<i>Trafic de stupéfiants,</i>
<i>tentative de meurtre...</i>
<i>Ecksley soupçonné</i>
<i>de trafic de narcotiques</i>
<i>Le roi de la drogue</i>
<i>dénoncé par un appel anonyme</i>
<i>10 millions de $</i>
<i>portés manquants</i>
Je vous sers ?
Je cherche quelqu'un.
Luther Ecksley.
C'est important.
Connais pas.
Quelqu'un connaît Luther Ecksley ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux
ŕ Luther Ecksley ?
Je veux juste lui parler.
Alors, parle.
Tu n'es pas Luther.
Tu trouveras pas plus proche.
Luther moisit
dans une prison mexicaine.
Il va y rester
un sacré bout de temps.
Tu trouveras jamais Luther.
M. Ecksley, je m'appelle Jarod.
Trois ans dans ce...
trou.
Aucune visite, aucune lettre,
aucun coup de fil.
Et voilŕ qu'une organisation
humanitaire
s'inquičte pour moi.
Pas pour vous.
Ah bon ?
J'abandonne.
Il s'appelle Ryan.
Il a 8 ans,
est ŕ l'hôpital
et attend une greffe de rein.
En quoi ça me concerne ?
C'est votre fils.
Continuez.
Il a une maladie sanguine rare,
héritée de vous.
Vous ętes le seul au monde
ŕ pouvoir le sauver.
Comment ?
J'essaierai de vous libérer
provisoirement.
Vous voulez que je donne un rein ?
La vie de votre fils en dépend.
- Ca mérite réflexion.
- On n'a pas le temps.
Si vous refusez,
il mourra.
Qui est la mčre ?
Elle s'appelait Cindy Brenner.
Je me souviens d'elle.
Elle va bien ?
Elle ira bien,
si vous acceptez.
Son fils sait, pour moi ?
Et vous ne le verrez
peut-ętre jamais.
Le temps presse, Luther.
Vous croyez ŕ la rédemption,
Jarod ?
Peut-ętre.
Vous avez beaucoup ŕ racheter.
Ce serait un début.
Zut, Broots.
On a raté le sermon.
Vous allez ŕ l'église ?
Aprčs ce que j'ai vu et fait,
c'est le dernier endroit oů aller.
Ou le premier.
Révérend Collins ?
Jack.
Que puis-je pour vous ?
Nous cherchons cet homme.
Il vous a aidé, ici ?
Aidé ?
Jarod est un ange !
A qui le dites-vous !
Vous savez
oů il a pu s'envoler ?
Il est parti ce matin.
Jarod habitait ici ?
Plusieurs paroissiens
l'auraient hébergé,
mais il ne voulait pas déranger.
J'avais oublié ce sous-sol
avant que Jarod m'en parle.
C'est bien Jarod, ça !
Toujours une idée.
Il a dit qu'il reviendrait
bientôt.
Il a passé la frontičre.
Le Mexique ?
Il a trouvé des bancs pas chers.
On n'est pas riches, ici.
Comme on dit : "Priez Dieu,
mais achetez un billet de loto."
Prenez votre temps.
J'y vais.
Pas de repos pour les pécheurs.
Trop tard.
Il a fait place nette.
En effet.
Oů allez-vous ?
Ne faites pas attention ŕ nous.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Notre billet de loto.
Laisse.
Vous ne comprenez pas.
La vie d'un enfant
dépend de vous.
Réfléchissez bien.
Ecksley a été pris
avec 25 kg d'héroďne.
En prison,
il a attaqué 5 gardiens.
Ce n'est pas un saint.
Mais il veut sauver
la vie de son fils.
Vous pensez peut-ętre
avoir éveillé sa conscience,
mais cet homme doit
Il m'échapperait.
Il y a des risques.
Cet enfant en vaut la peine.
J'ai une responsabilité
envers mon pays.
Vous ne m'écoutez pas !
La vie de Ryan
est entre vos mains.
J'ignore si vous comprenez
ma situation.
Mes prédécesseurs
étaient des sadiques.
Ils brutalisaient les détenus.
Il y a eu des morts,
des cas de torture.
Et ces sadiques
attendent une erreur de ma part
pour reprendre les commandes.
Je refuse que ça arrive.
Quel rapport avec Ryan ?
Contactez vos autorités,
vos médias.
Il ne peut pas attendre.
Je regrette,
mais je ne peux pas vous aider.
- Vos enfants ?
- Oui.
S'il s'agissait de l'un d'eux ?
Je répčte :
je ne peux pas vous aider.
Mais si vous preniez
des mesures radicales,
je comprendrais.
Conduisez Ecksley
dans sa cellule.
Il charge le camion
cet aprčs-midi.
Au revoir, Jarod.
Bonne chance.
Cindy ? Ici Jarod.
Vous l'avez trouvé ?
J'y travaille.
Comment va Ryan ?
<i>Les médecins se taisent,</i>
<i>c'est mauvais.</i>
Le temps presse.
Je ne peux pas le perdre.
<i>Il faut ętre forte.</i>
Vous avez parlé
ŕ votre mari ?
J'ai essayé.
Je ne veux pas le blesser.
Ce sera pire s'il l'apprend
par ailleurs.
Il vous aime.
Fiez-vous ŕ ça.
Le reste suivra.
Ca va ?
Ferme la porte.
Il faut qu'on parle.
Sale bonhomme !
La photo date de 3 ans.
Luther Ecksley. Il purge une peine
de 25 ans au Mexique.
Il passait de la drogue
quand un anonyme
l'a donné ŕ la police mexicaine.
Ce n'est pas un gentil.
Que fait Jarod avec lui ?
Demandons-le ŕ Luther.
<i>Merci d'avoir été mon pčre</i>
<i>ce week-end.</i>
<i>Vous croyez ŕ la rédemption ?</i>
<i>Je ne peux pas le perdre.</i>
<i>Si vous preniez</i>
<i>des mesures radicales...</i>
<i>...je comprendrais.</i>
Vous voulez sortir d'ici ?
Un peu !
La rédemption, c'est pas facile.
On a réussi ! Incroyable.
Je suis libre !
C'est provisoire.
Ne l'oubliez pas.
Vous avez un plan
pour passer aux USA ?
Les petites routes
jusqu'ŕ Tijuana.
On se męlera aux touristes.
J'ai des habits
dans cette voiture
et un faux passeport.
Vous avez tout prévu.
On n'a pas le temps
de se tromper.
J'apprécie, Jarod,
mais la vie du gamin,
je m'en tape.
On dirait
qu'ils bouclent la prison.
Vous allez nous lâcher ?
J'ai déjŕ perdu une heure.
Personne ne sort
avant qu'on ait tout fouillé.
Vous pouvez ętre liés
ŕ son évasion.
C'est absurde.
Je répčte que c'est lui.
Vous avez demandé
ŕ voir Ecksley
quand on a découvert
sa disparition.
C'était peut-ętre une diversion.
D'une bętise incroyable.
Pourquoi serait-on restés ici ?
Pourquoi se cachait-il
dehors ?
Il se cache toujours.
Comme un cafard.
Broots, dites-lui.
C'est vrai...
Cafard-ville.
Patientez un peu.
Un gardien a entendu Jarod
parler d'une greffe
pour un enfant.
Quel enfant ? Oů ça ?
Je ne suis pas au courant.
Assis !
Tiens bon, mon chéri.
Ta maman t'aime.
Ted ?
Vous ne l'avez pas trouvé ?
Pas encore.
Vous avez parlé ŕ Ted ?
Il me déteste.
Je le comprends.
Il ne vous déteste pas.
Il a besoin de temps
pour s'adapter.
Hier matin,
ma vie était parfaite.
Maintenant, mon fils est mourant
et mon mari...
Vous devez rester forte.
Pour Ryan.
Tout va s'arranger.
Je le sais.
Je l'ai trouvé.
Parmi toutes les urgences,
un seul petit garçon
attend un rein.
- Oů ?
- San Diego.
On retourne ŕ San Diego.
Illico !
100 $ sur Harold.
<i>Ray, mon vieux !</i>
<i>Ca roule ?</i>
Luther ?
Le seul et unique.
Il paraît que ça roule pour toi.
<i>Pas mal.</i>
<i>Pas mal, c'est tout ?</i>
<i>J'ai une nouvelle pour toi.</i>
J'ai pris des vacances
de mes vacances.
<i>Surprise ! Je suis de retour.</i>
<i>T'es le premier que j'appelle.</i>
J'ai hâte de te voir, mon pote.
<i>T'es toujours lŕ ?</i>
Oui, je suis lŕ.
<i>Il faut qu'on se voie.</i>
Pour discuter
de la suite des opérations.
Disons minuit.
<i>Au Hilton de Mission Bay.</i>
Ce soir ?
Y a pas le feu.
Il y a 3 ans, un enfoiré
m'a balancé aux flics mexicains.
J'imagine que cet enfoiré
a mes 10 millions.
<i>Alors, tu comprends</i>
<i>mon impatience ?</i>
<i>Apporte des fringues.</i>
Quand on trouvera ce salaud,
ça va saigner.
T'as vu un fantôme ?
Tu es bien nerveux.
Mais c'est normal,
pour un homme marqué.
De quoi tu causes ?
C'était Luther ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il voulait ?
T'annoncer son retour ?
Il veut renouer
avec son associé ?
C'est un pičge, Ray.
Et c'est normal.
Il se venge.
C'est toi
qui as appelé les flics
pour balancer ton ami Luther.
Va te faire foutre.
Je suis allé ŕ Hermacio.
J'ai suivi son procčs,
comme un ami.
En apparence.
A mon avis,
c'était un peu gros.
Je parie que Luther
pense la męme chose.
Tu es dingue.
Vraiment ?
Regarde derričre moi,
dans la voiture, c'est Luther.
Il t'attend.
Il joue avec toi.
Quand tu l'auras conduit
ŕ l'argent, il te tuera.
Alors, fais ce que je dis
ou tu n'en sortiras pas vivant.
Et maintenant ?
Conduis Luther ŕ l'argent,
comme prévu.
Si ça marche pas,
on est morts.
Roule et suis bien
mes instructions.
C'est dingue.
Cache-toi.
A mon signal, ce sera ŕ toi.
C'est parti.
Ray ?
Laisse tomber.
Je sais que t'as volé
mes 10 millions.
J'y suis.
Tu veux jouer ŕ cache-cache ?
Tu ferais mieux de sortir.
Je pars pas sans mon fric.
Ca suffit, Ray.
Luther ?
Jarod ?
Surprise !
J'ai vu Ray vous descendre.
C'était le 1er acte.
Et le second ?
Je l'avais prévenu.
Il y a plein de fric
pour nous deux.
Je le prends.
C'est mon fric. Je l'ai volé
ŕ la sueur de mon front.
Je connais une église
qui le mérite plus.
J'aurais dű te descendre.
C'est vrai.
Merci.
Debout, Luther.
On a du pain sur la planche.
Bizarre, non ?
Se réveiller dans la douleur,
sans savoir oů on est.
Comme moi au Mexique.
Comme votre fils
sur son lit d'hôpital.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Vous ętes dingue ?
Calmez-vous,
vous allez casser la perfusion.
C'est pas un hosto.
Ca ira...
pour ce que j'ai ŕ faire.
Vous ętes pas médecin !
C'est vrai,
mais je suis fan d'Urgences.
Vous pouvez pas faire ça !
Le plus beau, Luther...
Vous voyez ?
Je peux.
Bonne nuit.
<i>Veuillez faire la chambre</i>
Cindy ?
J'ai parlé ŕ l'infirmičre.
Le rein semble prendre.
Ca va aller.
J'appelle mes parents.
Merci pour tout
ce que vous avez fait.
Votre fils va s'en tirer.
Mon fils ?
J'ai vécu un mensonge pendant
L'étiez-vous ?
J'ai vu le visage de cet enfant
quand il vous regarde.
Vous ne comprenez pas.
Mais si.
Lŕ, vous ętes en colčre
et vous souffrez,
mais si vous abandonnez
cet enfant maintenant,
cette blessure ne guérira jamais.
J'aimerais vous aider.
Ca tombe bien.
Parti ?
On n'a pas bougé !
La ferme !
M. et Mme Wells ?
Il était ici, n'est-ce pas ?
Jarod vous a aidés ?
Je ne connais aucun Jarod.
Ma femme et moi
attendons mon fils.
Si vous permettez,
nous aimerions ętre seuls.
Un truc m'échappe.
J'ai vérifié les admissions.
Pas de Luther Ecksley.
Qu'en pensez-vous, docteur ?
Celui qui a fait ça
s'y connaissait.
En effet.
Préparez le transfert
du détenu.

NICE FELLOW
<i>Ca, mon vieux, c'est une arnaque</i>
<i>américaine de première.</i>
<i>D'après un fax de l'armée,</i>
<i>la Commission trilatérale</i>
<i>était dans la zone 51</i>
<i>le 10 juin 197 4.</i>
C'est ça !
Et Michael Jordan joue toujours.
Ecoute, l'ami.
J'ai beau bosser pour
la plus petite radio de Chicago,
nos micros fonctionnent.
Un fax n'est pas un original !
<i>Parfois, si.</i>
Que disent les sondages ?
"Crétin" !
Faites un effort, les gars.
Quel est mon credo ?
"Toujours poser des questions."
Vous êtes avec Neil Roberts,
en direct d'un bunker
perdu dans la ville.
Mon petit coin d'anonymat.
Si vous avez un bon vieux complot,
de quoi stimuler mes synapses,
<i>appelez-moi.</i>
<i>Un auditeur a une remarque</i>
<i>sur le dernier appel.</i>
<i>C'était ma charmante productrice,</i>
<i>Angela Sommerset,</i>
<i>qui nous appelait du siège.</i>
Un vieil ami sur la 1.
La Source.
La Source ! Envoyez !
La Commission trilatérale
était dans le Delaware
ce jour-là.
- Qu'en sais-tu ?
<i>- On a déjeuné.</i>
J'étais derrière le miroir.
Au menu, compléments nutritionnels.
<i>Au menu, quoi ?</i>
Une longue histoire.
Tu fuis toujours les A.C. ?
Les A.C. ?
<i>Tu baisses, la Source !</i>
Les "autorités constituées".
Elles t'ont fait quoi ?
Elles m'ont enlevé
à ma famille.
<i>Je me souviens à peine</i>
<i>de mes parents.</i>
<i>Je les cherche</i>
<i>depuis un bout de temps.</i>
Je n'ai pas de commentaire
à faire, à part
que cette quête-là
vient du coeur.
<i>Je t'envie. Je n'ai personne</i>
<i>d'aussi proche.</i>
A l'exception d'une seule.
<i>Et elle ignore mon existence.</i>
Mais c'est une longue histoire
et tu es en fuite.
Comme d'habitude.
<i>Fais gaffe... Après cet appel</i>
<i>instructif de notre ami la Source,</i>
<i>on rejoint un auditeur mécontent</i>
qui appelle d'un portable.
<i>Alors, mouchard,</i>
<i>t'as reçu ma carte ?</i>
<i>J'en reçois des tonnes.</i>
<i>J'ai envoyé un colis.</i>
<i>Et voilà le colis.</i>
<i>Je l'ouvre à l'antenne.</i>
Et voilà.
<i>Ce n'est pas trop ?</i>
<i>Un rat mort.</i>
<i>Symbole de ton statut dans la vie,</i>
<i>des choix avec lesquels</i>
<i>tu dois vivre</i>
<i>ou mourir.</i>
<i>Comme dit la chanson :</i>
<i>"This is the end. "</i>
<i>Gare au fromage, Neil !</i>
<i>C'ESTL'HEURE</i>
Pardonne-moi, Patty.
<i>Neil, t'es encore là ?</i>
<i>J'entends rien.</i>
<i>Alors, tu donnes</i>
<i>ta langue au rat ?</i>
<i>Je verrais bien</i>
<i>la tête que tu fais.</i>
<i>D'ailleurs, j'arrive.</i>
Crève, rat !
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>à cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>Il défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
<i>Si Neil a été agressé,</i>
<i>pourquoi les flics y vont pas ?</i>
Parce que Neil émet
d'un lieu inconnu.
Neil, si tu m'écoutes, appelle.
Ca fait 37 mn.
On s'inquiète.
<i>Arrêtez vos conneries !</i>
<i>C'est encore un coup de pub.</i>
Eh, crétin...
si le but de Neil
est de dénoncer les complots,
tu crois qu'il ferait ça ?
<i>Ben ouais !</i>
Retourne au village.
Celui où il manque l'idiot.
- Je peux expliquer...
- A la police.
Vous l'auriez appelée
après l'agression de Neil.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Un type qui fuit les A.C.
- La Source ?
- Je m'appelle Jarod.
Vous avez peur
pour Neil.
Ca s'entend dans votre voix.
Ca a l'air dingue,
mais faites-moi confiance.
Grâce à l'émission,
je pourrai trouver Neil.
Nous revoilà.
Vous écoutez... la Source.
En attendant
des nouvelles de Neil,
voici une petite histoire
qui me tient à coeur.
Sur un enfant élevé
par une organisation
hautement secrète.
Une firme du Delaware
unique en son genre.
Bizarre,
certes, mais la vérité
l'est souvent.
Apprends à dormir ici.
C'était l'agent immobilier.
Alors, ils achètent ?
Ils ont déjà acheté.
J'allais te le dire...
Ne te justifie pas.
Il y a autre chose.
J'ai acheté une nouvelle maison
à retaper.
Ensemble.
A Portland.
J'adore le Maine.
Oregon.
Viens avec moi.
Dans l'Oregon ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Pour commencer,
j'ai une carrière.
Celle qui t'a donné un ulcère
qui a failli te tuer.
C'est plus qu'un travail.
Ma famille.
Tu prendras l'avion
pour les voir.
Tu ne les connais pas.
Ce n'est pas une décision
que je peux prendre maintenant.
Ici, en peignoir.
De quoi as-tu peur ?
De rien.
Tu m'en demandes beaucoup.
Je dois partir bientôt.
<i>Ton statut dans la vie, les choix</i>
<i>avec lesquels tu dois vivre</i>
<i>ou mourir.</i>
<i>Comme dit la chanson :</i>
<i>"This is the end. "</i>
Où es-tu ?
J'arrive chez toi.
<i>Neil vous a appelée</i>
<i>avant d'être agressé ?</i>
Vous vouliez
alerter la police
mais il vous a suppliée
de ne pas le faire.
Il m'a dit d'attendre son appel
sans aller chez lui.
"C'est vital, il a dit,
pas seulement pour moi."
Et il a dit...
"Si j'ai pas appelé demain,
c'est fini.
Pour toujours."
Le temps nous est compté.
Personne n'a rien entendu.
Il tenait à habiter
un immeuble abandonné.
C'est bien, pour se cacher.
Il a tiré dans la porte...
a fait feu sur Neil,
l'a poursuivi par ici.
La grenade est tombée là-bas.
Neil n'a pu sortir
que par cette porte.
Le sang de Neil.
Il est sorti vivant.
Jarod nous a laissé ça
devant chez lui à Chicago.
Cette maison est à Blue Cove.
Sacrés embouteillages !
Ou une panne d'oreiller.
La maison de ton plombier ?
Thomas est charpentier.
Oui, il l'a vendue.
Jarod peut lire les annonces.
- Ton chéri déménage ?
- En Oregon, peut-être.
Sacré trajet !
Appelez-moi
au retour des nettoyeurs.
Ne me regardez pas
comme ça.
Thomas déménage ?
Il veut vous faire quitter
Blue Cove ?
Quitter le Centre ?
Votre père va hurler.
Merci de le souligner.
Jadis, j'ai perdu
une famille
car les autorités constituées
avaient choisi ma voie.
Ne les laissez pas
vous dicter la vôtre.
Qui c'est ?
Ce timbré sait qu'elle compte
pour Neil.
Sa fille ?
Peut-être.
Une chose est sûre :
elle est la prunelle de ses yeux,
sans l'avoir rencontré.
Tout ça avec une carte ?
<i>Je n'ai personne d'aussi proche,</i>
<i>à l'exception d'une seule.</i>
<i>Et elle ignore mon existence.</i>
Il faut penser comme lui,
ressentir ce qu'il ressent.
"Toujours poser des questions."
Sa signature ?
Einstein a dit : "L'important est
de toujours poser des questions."
Tout concerne la fille
que Neil a affichée.
Il a retracé toute sa vie.
Son nom : Patricia Marie Lorenz.
Elle souffre de dégénérescence
congénitale des cellules.
Si on la trouve,
on risque de trouver Neil.
Ou celui qui le poursuit.
Ce timbré ne lâchera pas.
Non. Il continuera
à le poursuivre,
à le traquer comme une bête...
à le séparer de ceux qu'il aime...
à faire de sa vie un enfer...
jusqu'à ce que ça finisse,
peu importe comment.
Faites un effort !
Combien de débiles
envoient des rats morts ?
<i>C'est la télé.</i>
<i>Ca nous influence.</i>
Si vous laissez faire.
<i>J'y vais. Erkel m'envoie</i>
<i>un message secret.</i>
Au suivant.
<i>On peut le remplacer,</i>
<i>mais Neil peut pas se cacher.</i>
Pourquoi se cacherait-il ?
<i>A lui de vous répondre.</i>
<i>C'est lui qui s'est mis</i>
<i>en travers de mon chemin.</i>
Comment donc ?
Il a bousillé ma vie.
Mais les actes
ont des conséquences.
Et cette fois,
c'est moi qui commande.
<i>Vous commandez ?</i>
<i>Vous sonnez une cloche ?</i>
L'important,
c'est celui qui sonne.
Je suppose que c'est vous, Pavlov.
<i>Je peux vous appeler Pavlov,</i>
<i>n'est-ce pas ?</i>
Vous devriez peut-être
m'appeler A.C.
Vous appartenez aux A.C. ?
Je suis l'unique.
<i>Vous êtes là ?</i>
<i>Vous ne vous êtes pas envolé ?</i>
Neil m'a enlevé
ce qui comptait pour moi.
Je vais lui rendre
la pareille.
<i>Si vous êtes si puissant,</i>
<i>dites-nous qui vous êtes.</i>
<i>L'anonymat,</i>
<i>le vrai pouvoir est là.</i>
Même Neil-le-Lâche
<i>vous le dirait.</i>
<i>Il m'a tiré</i>
<i>dans le dos.</i>
<i>Maintenant, je suis celui</i>
qui tient le flingue...
<i>la balle qu'on voit pas venir.</i>
<i>Chacun a le droit</i>
<i>de voir ses accusateurs.</i>
Quelle charmante pensée !
Ecrivez-la donc
sur la tombe de Neil.
Vous avez entendu ?
Il est près de la ligne L.
Tant qu'il n'est pas
près de Neil...
<i>Angela ?</i>
Neil, Dieu soit loué !
Où es-tu ?
C'était lui à l'antenne.
Il lâchera jamais.
J'ai trouvé de l'aide.
Neil ? Ici la Source.
Vous devez cesser de fuir.
Restez en dehors de ça.
Je suis au courant
pour Patricia Marie.
N'approchez pas Patty.
C'est assez dur...
Partez !
Immédiatement !
Il est injoignable et la police
ne sait rien. C'est fini.
Il y a un code.
J'oubliais à qui j'avais affaire.
J'ignore son mot de passe.
<i>Accès autorisé</i>
La fondation New Vista.
Neil n'en parlait pas.
Il a fait de grosses donations.
Elle soutient la recherche
en neurologie.
Et elle paie
les soins à domicile de Patricia.
D'après ça,
il l'a fait déménager
il y a 6 mois.
Quand les menaces
ont commencé.
Mon ange ! Je te trouve
bien épanouie.
J'aurais besoin de ton ami.
Tom, c'est ça ?
Je suis contente
que tu parles de Thomas.
Il a un chantier
dans l'Oregon.
C'est un peu loin, non ?
Tu sais ?
Ton frère est une pipelette.
Je ne vois pas ma fille poser
du papier peint.
Je suis peut-être douée.
Crois-moi.
Retaper une vieille maison,
c'est un gouffre.
Ca n'en finit pas.
Et que deviendrais-je
sans mon ange ?
Tu sais pourquoi
je t'appelle ainsi ?
Quand tu avais 3 ans et demi,
dans notre maison de campagne...
Ma maison.
J'étais sur une échelle,
essayant de réparer
la verrière de ta mère.
Je grimpais le dernier échelon
quand tu as crié :
"Papa ! Cassé !"
Sans toi,
je faisais une chute
de 10 mètres.
Tu m'as sauvé la vie.
Ta mère a dit
que tu étais mon ange gardien.
Si tu pars,
c'est comme si j'étais mort.
J'ai perdu mes parents
à Fort Bragg toute petite.
Sans la fondation New Vista,
j'étais perdue.
Il n'y avait pas que l'argent,
mais aussi les cassettes.
J'en reçois tous les mois
depuis des années.
Certaines sont philosophiques,
d'autres poétiques,
ou simplement des contes.
C'est toujours la même voix.
Ca m'a permis d'apprendre,
de me concentrer,
de découvrir le monde.
Ca m'a ouvert
des tas de possibilités.
J'écris pour des sites web.
J'ai cherché à savoir
qui finançait la fondation,
mais en vain.
Ca vous ennuie
qu'on écoute une cassette ?
<i>Anna et Veronsky</i>
<i>étaient maintenant seuls,</i>
<i>en attendant la neige.</i>
<i>Ils n'avaient rien mangé</i>
<i>depuis des heures.</i>
Je n'avais que lui.
Il a une belle voix.
Je sais qu'il ne fait que lire,
mais sa voix est si...
réelle.
J'ai rejeté beaucoup de gens,
mais, ironie du sort,
je n'ai pas pu le rejeter.
Je ne le connais pas.
Il est comme un guide.
C'est grâce à lui
que je me bats encore
et que je suis en vie.
Neil lui dédie sa vie
et il est en danger à cause d'elle.
Et elle ne le connaît pas.
Encore une impasse.
Pas tout à fait.
Pavlov court toujours.
Il faut le faire parler.
Je vais vous parler
des autorités constituées.
Quand elles ne peuvent
vous atteindre,
elles s'en prennent
à ceux que vous aimez.
C'est ce qu'on a fait à Neil.
Les A.C. essaient
de vous prendre ces personnes,
et de vous prendre vos tripes.
Mais c'est une erreur,
car ceux que vous aimez
sont une faiblesse,
mais aussi une force.
Qui vous encourage,
vous donne l'avantage
sur les démons
qui s'en prennent
à votre âme.
<i>Sur la 1.</i>
<i>C'est lui, c'est Pavlov.</i>
<i>Je vous écoute.</i>
<i>Vous me faites pleurer.</i>
Pleurer de rire.
Pourquoi vous cacher
derrière le téléphone ?
Je lis dans votre tête.
Je ne vois pas
qu'un ver tourmenté,
<i>mais un homme seul,</i>
<i>qui a pour seuls amis</i>
<i>la haine et l'anonymat.</i>
Vous me semblez
bien plus seul que moi.
Pas assez d'amour
<i>de maman et papa ?</i>
<i>J'ai entendu</i>
<i>votre histoire de kidnapping.</i>
Mes parents
ne sont pas en cause.
<i>Je suppose</i>
<i>qu'ils sont votre vie.</i>
La vie que vous cherchez
nuit et jour.
<i>Des doutes doivent</i>
<i>vous ronger les tripes.</i>
Quels doutes ?
<i>"Peut-être</i>
<i>qu'ils m'ont abandonné,</i>
<i>"qu'ils me croient mort,</i>
"qu'ils ont clamsé."
Vous parcourez la surface
du globe à leur recherche
et ils sont six pieds sous terre.
Quand je vous aurai trouvé...
<i>Vous me trouverez jamais.</i>
Je suis un des secrets de Neil,
une contradiction
dans un paradoxe,
entouré de mystère.
<i>Un complot que lui-même</i>
<i>ne peut révéler.</i>
<i>Vous oubliez une chose,</i>
<i>l'orphelin.</i>
Je sais où vous bossez.
<i>Signal interrompu</i>
On l'a perdu.
<i>J'ai perdu une famille</i>
<i>car les autorités</i>
<i>avaient choisi ma voie.</i>
<i>Ne les laissez pas</i>
<i>vous dicter la vôtre.</i>
<i>Votre père va hurler.</i>
<i>Ta mère a dit</i>
<i>que tu étais mon ange gardien.</i>
<i>Si tu pars,</i>
<i>c'est comme si j'étais mort.</i>
Fort Bragg. Patty a perdu
ses parents là-bas.
Vous avez tort.
Donnez-moi cette arme.
Vous bossez pour lui ?
Pavlov dit être l'un
de vos secrets. Comment ça ?
Ca ne vous regarde pas.
N'approchez pas Patty.
Il va la tuer.
Vous êtes allé chez elle.
Pourquoi ?
Je vous cherchais.
Pour vous aider.
Ce n'est pas votre fille.
Qui est-elle ?
Quelqu'un que je ne mérite pas.
C'est faux.
Vous en avez fait une battante.
Elle ne devrait pas
avoir à se battre.
J'étais médecin.
Dans l'armée.
Vous ne lui avez rien fait.
Sa maladie est congénitale.
Epargnez-moi le baratin officiel.
La mère de Patty
était une patiente.
Non, elle était un sujet.
Une expérience ?
Financée par l'Etat.
Si seulement il s'agissait
d'un vaste complot,
je pourrais en rire
à la radio.
Mais on testait
des vaccins sur des soldats.
La routine.
C'est ce que je pensais.
On savait
la mère de Patty enceinte.
Au vu des analyses,
on pouvait penser qu'elle ferait
une réaction allergique.
On m'a dit
de "laisser pisser".
C'est ce que j'ai fait.
J'ai été lâche.
Je me suis persuadé
que mes supérieurs étaient sérieux.
On m'a transféré
et je n'ai rien su
des conséquences.
Jusqu'à ce que j'apprenne
l'accident.
Vous avez alors
découvert le mal de Patty.
Et vous lui avez
versé des fonds.
Je n'ai pas dit la vérité.
"Toujours poser des questions."
Vous avez consacré votre vie
à la révélation de la vérité.
A tous sauf à elle.
Pavlov a raison.
Je suis un imposteur.
Je parle de dire la vérité
mais, ironie du sort,
celle à qui je tiens le plus
ne l'entendra jamais de moi,
parce que j'en ai pas
les tripes.
"Les autorités constituées
"sont partout. Elles prennent
ceux que vous aimez."
Qui a pondu ça ?
Personne. On a capté ça
sur une radio de Chicago.
La radio WLNJ
a un nouvel animateur.
Il nous débine
et se fait appeler la Source.
La "source"... Le Centre.
Vous croyez ?
Envoyez les nettoyeurs.
J'en ai envoyé deux.
On est revenu ?
J'ai appris tes projets
avec M. Bricolage.
Oui, elle est là.
C'était le gardien du hall 4.
M. Bricolage est là.
On se croirait à Alcatraz.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Ce n'était pas toi qui parlais,
c'était ton père,
cet endroit,
peu importe ce que c'est.
C'est facile, pour toi.
Tu déboules dans ma vie,
pour la rebâtir
comme un chantier.
Tu jettes ce qui te déplaît.
Sans conséquences,
sans engagement.
Mais c'est un engagement !
Ton seul lien avec le monde
est une maison vide,
des clous et un camion rouillé.
Je n'ai pas ce luxe.
J'ai des obligations.
J'ai des relations.
Des obligations ?
Des relations ?
A t'entendre, c'est chaleureux.
Ton courrier est administratif,
tu es sur liste rouge
et je n'ai pas rencontré
tes "amis".
- J'ai une vie.
- Que tu refuses de partager.
Ce n'est pas une vie.
C'est la prison à vie.
Ne m'oblige pas
à renoncer à une partie de ma vie.
S'il te plaît.
Désolée.
Je ne veux pas te faire souffrir.
C'est moi.
Jarod.
Encore un sermon ?
Je voulais te dire
que Thomas vend.
A t'entendre,
vous en avez discuté.
Il déménage dans l'Oregon.
Il veut que je le suive.
<i>Alors, suis-le.</i>
Ca te plairait, hein ?
C'est trop tard.
Vous vous êtes disputés ?
Ce n'est pas ça
que tu veux.
Pourquoi vous savez tous
ce que je veux ?
<i>Ta mère savait.</i>
Elle quittait le Centre
quand on l'a tuée.
<i>Elle voulait t'emmener</i>
<i>loin de tout ça.</i>
C'est ce que veut Thomas.
<i>Ce n'est pas un hasard.</i>
Les archives fédérales
étaient une mine d'or.
Pavlov est le colonel
Willard Spence.
C'était mon supérieur.
Et après votre transfert,
il a intensifié les expériences.
J'ai fait des émissions
là-dessus à mes débuts.
L'armée injectait aux soldats
des produits toxiques
sans leur dire.
Votre émission
a inquiété l'armée.
Ils ont fait taire Spence.
Des familles ont porté plainte,
mais ont perdu.
Il y a eu une enquête interne.
Spence a été condamné
et incarcéré à Leavenworth
pendant 7 ans.
C'est long.
Assez pour se monter la tête.
Il vous accuse,
vous et votre émission,
de l'avoir balancé.
Son juge d'application des peines
est à côté de chez Patty.
On le trouvera.
Intelligence militaire.
C'est contradictoire.
Vous devez être intelligent.
Je m'intéresse
à un autre type intelligent...
très mystérieux,
qui surgit là
où on ne l'attend pas,
toujours prêt à aider
les opprimés.
<i>Un chirurgien démasque</i>
<i>un imposteur</i>
<i>Un inconnu résout</i>
<i>une affaire de meurtre</i>
<i>Un juge dénoncé</i>
<i>par un ancien détenu</i>
<i>Un professeur d'anatomie</i>
<i>dévoile un complot</i>
Je n'allais pas confier
mes secrets au premier venu !
Vous pouviez me démasquer
à l'antenne.
Je ne m'en prends
qu'aux mauvais complots.
Je suis heureuse
que tu n'aies rien.
Il y a des gens à la radio
qui cherchent Jarod.
En costard.
L'un répond au nom de Sam.
- Les nettoyeurs.
- Qui c'est ?
Les autorités constituées.
Les nettoyeurs
sont déjà à Chicago
et on poireaute à Blue Cove ?
Personne n'a vu Mlle Parker.
Son téléphone ne répond pas.
C'est bon, on se tire.
Elle a pris sa décision.
Je prends la mienne.
Ici Lyle. Allons-y.
<i>Il fait nuit noire, dehors</i>
<i>et vous écoutez la Source.</i>
<i>Mon invité : Neil Roberts.</i>
<i>Merci de me remplacer.</i>
<i>Je suis content</i>
<i>que ce dingue de Pavlov</i>
<i>vous ait raté.</i>
M. Lyle, Jarod a dû
prendre une autre entrée.
L'émission a commencé.
<i>Devinez qui est en ligne.</i>
<i>Allez-y, Pavlov.</i>
Vous avez eu tort.
<i>Pourquoi ?</i>
<i>Neil est prêt.</i>
<i>Venez vous venger au studio.</i>
<i>Prononcez le verdict, A. C.</i>
Volontiers,
mais pas là où vous croyez.
<i>C'est vrai ! Vous êtes</i>
<i>une énigme entourée de paradoxe.</i>
<i>Ou bien est-ce l'inverse ?</i>
<i>Les autorités constituées</i>
<i>ne font plus la loi.</i>
<i>On fait toujours la loi,</i>
<i>orphelin.</i>
<i>D'où notre nom :</i>
<i>les autorités constituées.</i>
Tiens,
les autorités "déconstituées" !
A vous, Neil !
<i>C'est l'heure d'une page de pub.</i>
<i>Restez avec nous.</i>
Le truc, avec les pièges,
c'est qu'ils confondent
le chasseur
et sa proie.
Désolé de voler votre métaphore,
mais elle est parfaite.
Rat. Piège.
Rat...
Piège !
Je vous ai eu !
Lâchez-moi !
Vous êtes tombé
en plein dedans, Pavlov.
Ou dois-je vous appeler docteur ?
Dr Willard Spence ?
Détachez-moi !
Combien de fois
Patricia s'est dit ça ?
C'était votre victime.
Vous l'avez piégée différemment.
Regardez. Des photos
de rats de laboratoire humains,
qui ne méritaient pas la vérité.
Des rats de laboratoire.
Des cobayes.
Des sujets humains.
Des personnes !
J'ai fait de la prison
pour ça !
Vous ne savez rien
de la prison.
Parfois, la pire prison,
c'est celle où on se réveille
chaque matin.
Quand on pense être libre
et qu'on est poursuivi, traqué !
Vous avez fait ça à Neil...
car il avait dit la vérité.
Vous êtes pâle, docteur.
J'ai bien fait
de lire votre dossier.
Diabète. Quel dommage !
Et c'est l'heure
de votre piqûre d'insuline.
Attention : une seule seringue
contient de l'insuline.
Les autres contiennent
un produit hautement toxique.
Mais ce qui est bon
pour les sujets du docteur
est bon pour lui aussi.
Du sucre.
Vous êtes fou !
Essayez de faire am-stram-gram.
Mais je vous préviens :
question probabilité,
c'est pas terrible.
Bonne pioche !
Attendez ! Je vais mourir.
Je suis plus gentil
que vous avec Neil.
Amusez-vous
à "la seringue de la fortune".
Je l'ai traqué !
Je voulais le tuer !
Il a gâché ma vie,
j'ai juré de gâcher la sienne.
Où est l'insuline ?
En fait... dans les trois.
Savourez le fromage.
<i>- Je l'ai traqué.</i>
- Pour l'émission de Neil.
<i>Je voulais le tuer !</i>
Ca fera fureur.
<i>Bonsoir, Chicago.</i>
<i>L'oncle Neil est de retour.</i>
Cette voix...
Je la connais.
C'est lui !
Il vous attend.
<i>Avant de prendre les appels,</i>
<i>j'ai une affaire personnelle</i>
<i>à régler.</i>
<i>J'ai une chose à dire</i>
<i>à une personne chère</i>
<i>depuis longtemps.</i>
Patty, j'espère que
quand tu sauras la vérité,
tu me pardonneras.
C'est un "oui" ?
Il y a des choses...
que tu dois savoir
avant de faire de moi
une partie de ta vie.
Tu avais raison.
Ce n'était pas moi.
Je n'ai pas été moi
depuis longtemps.
Pas depuis...
J'ai compris ça en t'aimant.
Il y a des parties de moi...
Des zones d'ombres.
Et tu as peur
qu'en les voyant,
je te rejette ?
S'il y a un problème,
on s'en occupera. Ensemble.
Je suis réparateur.
Ca fait de moi
ton nouveau chantier.
Celui-ci,
je ne le vendrai jamais.
<i>Tôt ou tard,</i>
<i>notre vie bifurque.</i>
<i>Récemment, ma vie</i>
<i>a sacrément bifurqué.</i>
Je m'en suis tiré,
grâce à un nouvel ami.
Je sais que tu m'écoutes.
<i>Surveille tes arrières</i>
<i>et ne renonce pas.</i>
<i>Car quelque part sur ta route,</i>
<i>tu trouveras ta bifurcation.</i>
<i>Bonsoir, Chicago.</i>

NICE FELLOW
Tu sembles fičre comme un paon.
La chasse est terminée.
Remarquable !
Au bureau du coin, mon ange.
Au bureau du coin ?
Je m'en vais, papa.
Tu quittes le Centre ?
On était d'accord.
Je ramčne Jarod
et je pars ŕ mes conditions.
Papa ?
Ca ne fait que commencer.
Tout va bien.
Tu es réveillée. C'est fini.
Tu te trompes,
ça ne finira jamais.
Vous ne me devez rien,
Mme Hartunian.
Appelez-moi Rita,
je vous en prie.
D'oů je viens,
on a de la gratitude.
Vous m'avez sauvée
de mon voleur de propriétaire.
Je vous suis redevable.
Vous aimez la loterie ?
Je n'y ai jamais joué.
Tenez, grattez et amusez-vous.
Merci.
On a une chance
de gagner le gros lot
sur 13 983 816.
Autant que d'ętre frappé
par la foudre dans un sous-marin.
Vous me portez chance.
J'espčre vous rendre la pareille.
D'accord, j'essaie.
Désolé, ça s'est renversé.
Ca va ?
Ne bouge pas !
C'est mon sac ŕ dos !
Et ça,
c'est l'argent de Mme Hartunian.
Tu t'appelles ?
De quoi !
Pardon ?
De quoi je me męle ?
Tu pensais prendre le train,
"De quoi" ?
J'ai pas ŕ vous répondre.
Laisse-moi te donner un conseil,
Dylan...
Si tu voles
le portefeuille de ton pčre,
assure-toi
qu'il y a plus de liquide.
Il a l'air sympa.
C'est un salaud.
Comme la plupart des avocats.
Vętements, brosse ŕ dents.
Je parie
que tu partais de chez toi.
- Et alors ?
- Je n'ai jamais eu de chez-moi.
On est deux.
Suis mon conseil :
ne quitte pas ta famille.
Quel que soit le problčme,
ça s'arrangera.
Mes amis sont la seule famille
qui compte.
Petit voleur !
Vous allez appeler les flics ?
Et si je te ramenais chez toi ?
Tu vis sur un bateau ?
Mon pčre vient de s'installer ici.
Il est séparé de ma mčre.
Oů est-elle ?
A Londres.
Elle commence un nouveau boulot.
Ecoutez, vous perdez votre temps.
Mon pčre passe son temps
ŕ son cabinet.
Voilŕ notre bateau.
Il y a quelqu'un.
C'est incroyable !
- Ton pčre ?
- J'y crois pas !
Il est jamais lŕ !
<i>On m'a enlevé ŕ ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjŕ</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>ŕ cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>Il défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous ętes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Tu parlais du bateau.
Avant que mon pčre
ne change de cabinet,
on retapait le bateau. Il y avait
du dissolvant, de la peinture,
plein de choses
qui ont pu sauter.
On essaie de joindre ta mčre.
Mais en attendant,
les services sociaux
vont s'occuper de toi.
Vous lui cachez quelque chose.
Oui, on a trouvé ça
sur le tableau d'affichage.
C'est l'écriture de Hale.
Une lettre d'adieu.
Je peux lui dire ?
Allez-y.
Excusez-moi.
Je devais ętre
le premier prévenu !
J'ignorais
qu'il travaillait pour vous.
Les plongeurs sont ŕ l'eau,
mais vu les courants,
on peut mettre 48 h ŕ le trouver.
Mettez-en plutôt 36, d'accord ?
- Oů est le fils de Hale ?
- Il était lŕ.
Trouvez-le.
Son pčre a pu lui parler.
Quand on est arrivés,
Jarod était parti depuis longtemps.
C'était dans son tiroir.
Le message est clair.
Les conclusions de Parker ?
Mlle Parker n'a pas pu
nous accompagner.
Ah bon ?
Elle était malade.
Je vois qu'elle a développé
d'autres intéręts.
Loin de moi l'idée de juger
quelqu'un qui vit une passion.
Mais tout le monde
ne sera pas aussi indulgent,
si elle néglige
ses responsabilités.
Tu feras une excellente épouse.
Si tu me voyais
avec un aspirateur !
Tu ne vas pas travailler ?
Il fait beau.
On pourrait prendre du vin, sortir.
Il faut que tu parles ŕ ton pčre.
Je sais.
Ecoute, si on doit
avoir un avenir ensemble,
sois honnęte envers lui.
C'est le seul moyen d'ętre libre.
Je sais.
Je ne peux pas vivre sans toi.
Je ne veux męme pas y penser !
Il faut d'abord faire le 0-1-1.
Tu appelais ta mčre, non ?
Vous me voulez quoi ?
La police a trouvé un mot.
Quel genre de mot ?
C'était l'écriture de ton pčre.
L'explosion sur le bateau
ne serait pas un accident.
Je suis vraiment désolé.
Le portefeuille de ton pčre.
Gardez-le.
Tu t'en vas ?
Oui, je retourne ŕ Atlanta.
Ta mčre va bientôt arriver.
Elle est partie en week-end.
On essaie de la joindre.
Si la police me retrouve,
je finirai aux services sociaux
ou dans un foyer d'accueil.
Je ne peux pas te laisser seul.
J'ai pas d'autre endroit
oů aller !
Il me vole
et veut s'installer chez moi !
J'ai aucune envie d'ętre ici !
Et poli, par-dessus le marché !
Vous avez dit
que je vous portais chance, non ?
Ca sera agréable
d'entendre ŕ nouveau
des pas sur ce plancher fatigué.
Je suis désolée pour ton pčre.
Ca va, Dylan ?
Ce matin, avant de partir,
j'ai dit ŕ papa
que je le détestais,
que je voulais
qu'il disparaisse pour toujours.
On dit tous
des choses qu'on ne pense pas.
C'est bien le problčme.
Je me demande
si je le pensais pas.
Mon pčre... avait une liaison
avec une femme du nom d'Ashley.
Je l'ai entendu se disputer
avec ma mčre pour ça.
Il partait toujours en douce
pour l'appeler d'une cabine.
Il n'a pas essayé de nier.
Ensuite, maman est partie
et papa et moi,
on s'est installés sur le bateau.
Qui étaient les deux hommes
au port ?
Ils travaillent
au cabinet de mon pčre.
Le plus vieux, c'est Iker Hoyt.
L'autre s'appelle Winston.
C'est le responsable
de la sécurité.
Il est méchant, Jarod.
Pourquoi tu dis ça ?
Il y a un mois,
j'ai entendu une dispute.
<i>Winston et mon pčre</i>
<i>étaient sur le quai.</i>
<i>Il le menaçait, lui disait</i>
<i>de ne pas doubler le cabinet,</i>
<i>qu'ils étaient trčs puissants</i>
<i>et qu'il devait protéger</i>
<i>sa famille.</i>
<i>Puis il a giflé</i>
<i>mon pčre et il est parti.</i>
Il aurait jamais dű
travailler lŕ-bas.
Il faut que je m'infiltre.
Qu'est-ce qui
ferait le plus peur
ŕ des juristes fiscaux ?
Ce qui nous fait peur ŕ tous.
Les services fiscaux !
Votre visite
nous surprend un peu.
La surprise, c'est notre métier.
Aprčs tout, nous sommes le fisc.
- Joli bâtiment !
- Nous en sommes fiers.
Le bureau de M. Hoyt.
Il vous attend.
M. Tally, soyez le bienvenu.
J'espčre ne pas vous déranger.
Cela changerait quelque chose ?
Je ne crois pas.
On est occupés.
Je n'ai pas saisi votre nom.
M. Winston,
responsable de la sécurité.
Notre service a trouvé
certaines irrégularités
dans vos derničres déclarations.
Rien de grave.
Des déductions ont changé,
cela affecte vos bilans.
Cela va prendre longtemps ?
S'il n'y a pas d'imprévu,
vous serez débarrassés de moi
d'ici 48 h.
On vous a installé un bureau.
Si je peux vous aider,
dites-le.
Je n'y manquerai pas.
<i>Comptabilité Hale</i>
<i>Accčs refusé</i>
Des nouvelles de sa mčre ?
J'ai cru qu'il s'userait le doigt
ŕ force de composer le numéro.
Il essaie de sauver la face,
mais ses yeux montrent
qu'il souffre.
Et son pčre ?
J'ai le numéro de la cabine
d'oů il appelait Ashley.
L'autre femme.
Il a appelé le jour
de l'anniversaire de sa femme.
J'ai la liste des appels
passés ce jour-lŕ de cet endroit.
Qu'est-ce qu'on cherche ?
Le numéro qui a été souvent
composé les jours précédents.
Ce doit ętre le numéro d'Ashley.
Grâce ŕ l'annuaire inversé,
on peut savoir qui est exactement
cette femme.
Qui est la briseuse de ménage ?
Il n'y en a pas.
Ashley n'est pas une femme.
C'est un agent du FBI.
Hale n'avait pas de liaison.
Alors, pourquoi
il a laissé maman partir ?
Je crois
qu'il essayait de vous protéger.
Vous éloigner, ta mčre et toi,
était son seul moyen.
Nous protéger de quoi ?
Découvrons-le.
Matthew Ashley, je vous prie.
Pardon ?
Quand ?
Non, merci quand męme.
Alors ?
L'agent Ashley est mort.
Dans un accident
de la route, il y a 5 jours.
<i>Ministčre de la Justice</i>
Ashley travaillait pour vous ?
Il enquętait sur un cabinet
d'avocats qu'on avait ŕ l'oeil.
Rassemblons nos forces.
M. Meek, le sénateur, sur la 2.
Je le rappelle.
- Il est mécontent.
- On est deux.
Quel remue-ménage !
C'est comme ça
en cas de mort imprévue.
On connaît
la cause de l'accident ?
Des travaux sur la route.
Ashley a perdu le contrôle
du véhicule. Un truc bizarre !
"Un truc bizarre" ?
Ashley avait un informateur
dans le cabinet Hoyt.
Il rassemblait des preuves
męlant le cabinet ŕ la mort
d'une personne devant témoigner
contre un gros client.
Cet informateur a un nom ?
Il a refusé de le donner.
Les preuves ?
Ashley est mort
avant de les avoir.
Excusez-moi.
C'est formidable.
J'espčre que tout va bien.
Jusqu'ici, oui.
Rapide et précis.
Un mélange fatal !
J'ai été sous contrat
pour une société du Delaware.
C'était un endroit redoutable,
mais j'y ai beaucoup appris.
Autre chose.
Je suis tombé sur des références
ŕ un certain Peter Hale.
J'ai voulu voir sa comptabilité,
l'accčs m'a été refusé.
Certains dossiers
sont réservés ŕ qui de droit.
C'est mon cas.
Je vous apporte ces dossiers.
Excusez-nous.
Męme le bureau du patron.
Ca ne m'étonne pas de vous,
Winston !
<i>Je ne lui fais pas confiance.</i>
<i>Vous ętes paranoďaque.</i>
<i>Vous me payez pour ça, non ?</i>
<i>On ne doit pas enquęter sur Hale.</i>
<i>Hale est mort. Ce n'est pas moi</i>
<i>qui nous ai mis dans le pétrin.</i>
<i>C'est vous.</i>
<i>J'ai fait mon devoir.</i>
<i>Je ne voulais pas de meurtre.</i>
<i>Sans ça,</i>
<i>De Paz serait encore en prison.</i>
<i>Vous savez ce que ça signifie ?</i>
De Paz...
Je le tiens !
<i>J'ai du sang sur les mains,</i>
<i>mais si je plonge, vous aussi.</i>
<i>Ne l'oubliez pas.</i>
<i>Je vais dans mon bureau.</i>
M. Winston ! Je vous cherchais.
J'ai trouvé
des erreurs dans vos déductions.
On pourrait étudier ça
aprčs le déjeuner.
- Impossible.
- Je vois.
Je n'aimerais pas
que ça prenne de l'ampleur.
Aprčs tout,
occupé comme vous l'ętes,
la derničre chose
qu'il vous faut, c'est un contrôle.
Vous me menacez ?
Je n'ai pas ŕ vous menacer.
Aprčs tout,
je représente le fisc.
Tu as dit que c'était urgent,
mon ange.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Je quitte le Centre, papa.
Tu pars ?
C'est chez toi, ici.
C'est la seule vie
que tu aies connue.
C'est la seule
qu'on m'a permis d'avoir.
Depuis que je suis enfant,
je cherche ŕ te satisfaire.
A la mort de maman,
c'est devenu ma raison de vivre.
Mais je ne suis plus une enfant.
Et je n'aurai plus besoin de ça.
Il s'agit
de ton charpentier, hein ?
Il s'appelle Thomas.
Et il s'agit de moi.
Donne-moi ta bénédiction.
Cela ne paraît pas juste.
Vous deviez rester jusqu'ŕ
ce que vous capturiez Jarod.
Ce qui n'est pas encore fait.
J'ai le droit d'avoir ma vie.
Allons !
Une organisation
aussi puissante que le Centre
peut sűrement remplacer
un individu.
N'agis pas sur un coup de tęte.
Ce n'est pas un coup de tęte.
Je sais ce que je veux.
C'est inacceptable.
Si vous ne l'en empęchez pas,
je le ferai.
Ne vous avisez jamais
de menacer ma famille.
Jamais.
Papa était un héros ?
Il aidait le FBI ŕ monter
un dossier contre le cabinet.
Leur client De Paz
était un dealer.
Il était accusé de meurtre.
Il y avait un témoin oculaire,
Molly Brophy.
Trois jours avant l'audience...
Ils l'ont tuée.
J'ai trouvé ça sur Internet.
<i>Un braquage d'épicerie</i>
<i>tourne mal</i>
<i>Le braquage fait trois morts</i>
Winston les a tués
pour protéger un client ?
Je crois.
Maintenant, il faut le prouver.
Voilŕ pourquoi
mon pčre avait peur.
Il avait dű découvrir
les meurtres.
Il essayait de faire son devoir.
Il me manque, Jarod.
Il me manque tellement...
Je sais.
Vous cherchez quoi ?
Hale ?
Vous ętes toujours vivant !
Et mon fils ?
Il est en sűreté.
Je vous ai vu partir avec lui.
Vous travaillez pour Hoyt !
Je m'appelle Jarod,
je veux vous aider.
- Pourquoi vous croire ?
- Votre fils me croit.
Et en ce moment, il est perdu
car il croit son pčre mort.
Vous ignorez
oů vous mettez les pieds.
Je suis au courant
pour Vincent De Paz.
Je sais que Molly,
ses petites-filles et Ashley
ont été assassinés.
Vous devriez me parler,
je suis votre derničre chance.
Je suis tombé
sur des irrégularités
dans une certaine affaire.
J'ai donc contacté le FBI.
Je devais rassembler des preuves
pour faire tomber
De Paz et le cabinet.
Maintenant, Ashley est mort.
Il avait une femme et des enfants.
Le FBI pense
que c'est un accident.
Je venais de donner ŕ Ashley
les preuves sur De Paz.
Peu aprčs, il est mort.
Les dossiers ont disparu.
Ce n'était pas un accident.
C'était Winston.
Aprčs, c'était mon tour.
Et vous avez mis en scčne
votre mort.
J'ai paniqué.
Winston surveille tout,
il sait tout.
Le seul moyen
était qu'il me croie mort.
Ca me laissait le temps
d'éloigner Dylan.
<i>J'ai eu l'idée</i>
<i>de faire sauter le bateau.</i>
<i>J'ai fermé la cabine</i>
<i>et je l'ai remplie de propane.</i>
<i>J'ai appelé l'école de Dylan</i>
<i>pour le retrouver.</i>
<i>Il n'y était pas.</i>
<i>J'ai commencé</i>
<i>ŕ m'inquiéter pour lui.</i>
<i>Je savais</i>
<i>que Winston me surveillait.</i>
<i>Mieux valait qu'il me croie mort.</i>
<i>J'ai laissé la lettre,</i>
<i>je suis remonté ŕ bord.</i>
<i>Il y avait une balise</i>
<i>dans la cabine.</i>
<i>J'ai plongé.</i>
Quand Winston aurait su
que le bateau était vide,
Dylan et vous auriez rejoint
votre femme.
En vous voyant sortir du cabinet,
j'ai cru perdre Dylan.
Il croit que son pčre est mort.
J'ai laissé les choses
se dégrader entre nous.
Mais j'ai agi pour le protéger.
Vous croyez qu'il me pardonnera ?
Et si on le lui demandait ?
Rien ne vaut l'odeur
du bois fraîchement coupé.
Ces montants doivent ętre
espacés de combien ?
Environ 80 cm.
Vous en mettez tous les 50 cm.
C'est du gâchis.
Ca double la vie de la structure,
c'est ce qui m'importe.
Quelle intégrité !
Vous connaissez
la charpenterie ?
J'en sais un peu
sur plein de choses.
Vous pourriez me passer
un serre-joint ?
Ma présence doit vous étonner.
Elle vous a parlé de son départ.
On n'a pas de secrets
l'un pour l'autre.
Il vous faudrait
de nouveaux outils.
Je peux vous aider, M. Parker ?
Un chčque ?
Mettez le montant
de votre choix.
On se serre la main,
on reprend sa vie.
Chacun la sienne.
J'aime votre fille, M. Parker.
Tout l'argent du monde
ne peut rien y changer.
Oů est Dylan ?
Dieu merci, vous ętes lŕ !
- Oů est Dylan ?
- J'ai fait mon possible.
Mais il était tellement furieux.
Il a pris le pistolet
de mon Otto.
Oů est-il parti ?
A la poursuite de Winston.
Donne-moi ça.
Ne vous en męlez pas !
Et moi ?
Papa ?
Je te croyais mort.
J'ai cru mourir
en pensant ne plus te revoir.
Je suis vraiment désolé.
J'ai vu le bateau sauter.
Je te promets
d'arranger les choses
pour qu'elles redeviennent
ce qu'elles étaient.
Avec maman aussi ?
Surtout avec maman.
Venez !
On a du pain sur la planche.
Quoi que je fasse,
ils ne me laisseront pas partir.
Tu es adulte,
tu peux prendre tes décisions.
Ce n'est pas si simple.
Qui peut venir si tard ?
J'espčre qu'on ne te dérange pas.
Que fais-tu ici, papa ?
On voulait savoir
si tu allais bien.
C'est ça !
Je voulais te parler, chérie.
On peut entrer ?
Bien sűr.
Nom de Dieu !
Quoi ?
Hale est vivant.
C'est impossible.
C'est un pičge.
Regardez le journal.
La photo est d'aujourd'hui.
Tout ça n'était qu'un coup monté.
Hale est au courant pour Molly
et l'agent du FBI.
Il veut de l'argent.
Il m'attend dans un parking.
Je dois y aller seul.
Alors ?
Je vais le retrouver. Seul.
Ensuite, je tuerai ce salaud
une fois pour toutes.
Vous ne voulez rien boire ?
Non, merci, Thomas.
Papa ?
Tu voulais me parler
de quelque chose ?
Je ne suis plus tout jeune.
J'ai mes habitudes.
Je n'aime pas le changement.
Mais j'ai pensé ŕ toi
et ton jeune ami...
J'ai été égoďste.
Je ne comprends pas.
Les yakusas
disent que
l'amour et la peur volent
sur la męme aile.
Ce qu'on fait par amour,
on le fait aussi par peur.
Comme quand papa a voulu acheter
le départ de Thomas.
Quoi ?
Pourquoi n'avoir rien dit ?
Ca n'était pas important.
Il a fait une erreur, c'est tout.
Une parmi tant d'autres, hélas.
Mon ange, je suis terrifié.
Pourquoi ?
Ton frčre et toi,
vous ętes ma vie. Si tu pars,
je perds
ce qu'il y a de meilleur en moi.
Mais si tu crois que partir est
ce qu'il y a de mieux pour toi...
pars avec ma bénédiction.
Tu es sérieux ?
Je ne veux que ton bonheur.
C'est ce que j'ai toujours voulu.
Il est tard
et on doit se lever tôt.
Bonne nuit, chérie.
Félicitations !
Tu es enfin maîtresse de ta vie !
C'est comment ?
Perturbant.
Tu m'étonnes !
Je vais fermer la porte.
Et toi, tu éteins la lumičre.
Merde !
Vous désirez ?
Il y a un téléphone public ?
A l'entrée.
Mais il est en panne.
J'ai crevé
et j'ai un rendez-vous important.
Je peux téléphoner d'ici ?
En ville ?
C'est peut-ętre une ruse.
Vous dites que c'est en ville
et en fait, c'est ŕ l'étranger
et je dois payer !
Voici 20 dollars.
Je peux utiliser votre téléphone ?
Soyez bref.
Merci infiniment.
Pas un geste !
C'est un hold-up !
Sortez de lŕ !
Obéissez !
Sortez de chez moi !
Ca va pas ?
On ne me volera pas !
Plutôt mourir !
Non, laissez tomber !
Posez cette arme !
Faites ce qu'il dit.
Ca va pas ?
J'ai paniqué !
Va la voir !
Je n'ai rien vu.
Mon Dieu, je l'ai tuée !
Imbécile !
Tirons-nous !
Ferme-la !
Laisse-moi réfléchir.
Je n'ai rien vu.
Par lŕ !
Tu l'as tuée !
On peut pas laisser un témoin !
Mais je peux vous aider !
Quoi ?
Vous l'avez tuée, et alors ?
C'est un accident.
Il a tué de sang-froid !
On risque la chaise électrique !
Pas si vous m'écoutez.
Je travaille
pour un gros cabinet de la ville.
Un avocat ? Sűrement pas !
Mais non, je suis comme vous !
Pas du tout ! A genoux !
Vous avez tué personne !
Si, une vieille dame dans
un magasin. Je m'en suis tiré !
Ne me tuez pas, croyez-moi !
Je vous crois.
Et vous ?
Oui, je le crois.
Quoi ?
Je vous crois.
Moi aussi.
Vous oubliez une chose.
Vous avez aussi tué deux enfants
et un agent du FBI.
Qui vous ętes ?
Quelqu'un qui va envoyer
ces cassettes au FBI.
<i>J'ai du sang sur les mains,</i>
<i>mais si je plonge, vous aussi.</i>
<i>Ne l'oubliez jamais.</i>
<i>Une vieille dame dans un magasin</i>
<i>et je m'en suis tiré !</i>
<i>Ne me tuez pas !</i>
<i>Croyez-moi.</i>
Ca rend bien,
vous ne trouvez pas ?
Ordure !
Du calme.
On ne sait jamais.
C'est peut-ętre...
votre jour de chance.
Alors ? Quelque chose de ce genre
ou un gros voilier ?
On devrait vivre
sur la terre ferme.
- Pourquoi pas une maison ?
- Tu as raison.
Vous avez accompli votre mission.
<i>Deux hommes écroués</i>
<i>pour une série de meurtres</i>
Je n'y serais pas arrivé
sans vous.
Merci, Jarod.
Et maintenant ?
Je vais essayer
de réunir ma famille.
Je crois que la pičce manquante
du puzzle arrive.
Maman !
Rita, qu'y a-t-il ?
C'est un miracle !
La foudre
vient de frapper mon sous-marin !

<i>- Parle-moi de l'amour, maman.</i>
<i>- Que veux-tu savoir ?</i>
<i>Un jour, je trouverai quelqu'un</i>

<i>Je crois.</i>
<i>Comment je saurai</i>
<i>que je suis amoureuse ?</i>
<i>C'est différent pour chacun.</i>
<i>J'avais le vertige</i>

<i>Il était très beau ?</i>
<i>Beau ? Oui. Superbe.</i>
<i>Mais ne le lui répète pas,</i>

<i>J'espère que moi aussi,</i>

<i>Maman...</i>
<i>Maman, ne m'abandonne pas !</i>
<i>Viens avec moi.</i>
<i>Dans l'Oregon ?</i>
<i>Pourquoi pas ?</i>
Si je n'ai plus d'eau chaude,
je te tue.
<i>Un jour, je trouverai quelqu'un</i>
<i>comme tu as trouvé papa ?</i>
<i>Je crois.</i>
Je sais que c'est dur
de vivre avec moi.
J'ai plus de bagages
qu'un aéroport.
Mais je veux que ça marche.
Je suis décidée...
à ce que ça marche entre nous.
Alors...
si tu veux toujours que
je vienne à Portland avec toi,
je viendrai.
J'en ai envie.
Je viens de vider mes tripes
sur le carrelage importé d'Italie,
tu pourrais au moins
m'offrir un grognement !
Mon Dieu !
Tu m'entends, chéri ?
Non, ce n'est pas possible.
Ca va, je suis là.
Que faites-vous ?
J'ai besoin d'aide !
- La police ?
- Non, attendez !
Il y a eu un meurtre
à Briar Road !
Envoyez quelqu'un !
Je donne pas mon nom !
Ne m'abandonne pas !
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>

<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>

<i>Il défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Combien de temps
après la découverte
du corps de M. Gates
cet inconnu
a-t-il appelé les secours ?
Quelques secondes.
Vous ne l'aviez jamais vu ?
Jamais.
Il était blanc. 1,90 m, 80 kg.
Il avait un fourgon
plein d'ordures.
Quelle couleur ?
Vert. Peut-être marron.
Vert.
Peut-être marron.
J'avais d'autres préoccupations.
J'imagine. Vous ne voulez
vraiment pas d'avocat ?
Vous y avez droit.
Je n'ai rien à cacher.
Est-ce que vous couchiez
avec la victime ?
Pardon ?
C'est simple.
Aviez-vous des rapports sexuels ?
Tommy et moi,
nous nous aimions.
On devait
faire notre vie ensemble.
Alors...
pourquoi un aller simple
pour l'Oregon dans sa veste ?
<i>Viens avec moi.</i>
<i>Dans l'Oregon ?</i>
<i>Pourquoi pas ?</i>
<i>J'ai ma carrière.</i>
<i>Qui t'a coûté un ulcère.</i>
<i>L'ambition professionnelle</i>
<i>est une impasse.</i>
<i>Il y a aussi ma famille.</i>
<i>Tu leur rendras visite.</i>
<i>Tu ne les connais pas.</i>
<i>Je ne peux pas</i>
<i>me décider comme ça.</i>
<i>Ici, en peignoir.</i>
<i>Tu as peur de quoi ?</i>
<i>De rien.</i>
Tommy avait l'intention
de restaurer la maison.
Je devais
le retrouver plus tard.
On s'est introduit chez moi.
Tommy les a entendus,
il les a suivis dehors
et s'est fait tuer.
C'est une possibilité.
Il y en a une autre ?
Excusez-moi.
Vous avez une arme ?
Comment ?
On a trouvé cet étui vide
dans votre salon.
Vous possédez une arme à feu ?
Quel type ?
Un Smith & Wesson, 9 mm.
C'est une belle pièce.
Pourquoi avez-vous besoin
d'une telle arme ?
Je travaille
pour une société internationale.
Je voyage, ça me rassure.
Vous travaillez pour ce complexe
en dehors de la ville, non ?
Son nom ?
Le Centre.
Je n'ai jamais su
ce qu'on y faisait.
Des recherches.
Sans blague ! Et quel genre
de trucs vous cherchez ?
Je ne vois pas le rapport
avec le meurtre de Thomas.
Le rapport du légiste indique
que M. Gates a été tué
d'une balle dans la tête.
La blessure a été faire
par un 9 mm.
Actuellement,
votre arme a disparu.
Vous êtes sûre, pour l'avocat ?
Mlle Parker,
on est désolés pour Thomas.
Il était... enfin, il avait l'air
de quelqu'un de très bien.
Comment tu as pu faire ça ?
Laisser les autorités
s'occuper du Centre.
Sans vouloir
te manquer de respect.
Mais on sait
combien c'est risqué.
Ce n'est pas moi
qui ai appelé la police.
Le type des poubelles,
devant chez moi.
Navré que vous ayez affronté
cela seule.
Et mon père ?
Il était à Montréal,
pour affaires.
Il a pris le premier avion.
On peut faire quelque chose ?
Me rendre Tommy.
<i>Ken Johnson nous présentera</i>
<i>le bulletin météo</i>
<i>plus tard dans ce journal.</i>
<i>Retrouvons Kate Scofield au sujet</i>
<i>de l'incident d'aujourd'hui.</i>
<i>Il y aurait eu un homicide</i>
<i>à Blue Cove.</i>
<i>Ce pourrait être</i>
<i>une tentative de cambriolage</i>
<i>qui s'est soldée par la mort</i>
<i>d'un certain Thomas Gates.</i>
<i>Le propriétaire de la maison</i>
<i>reste à identifier.</i>
<i>On ignore s'il y a des témoins.</i>
<i>L'enquête se poursuivra</i>
<i>tout au long de la nuit.</i>
<i>Nous espérons avoir</i>
<i>plus de détails à 23 h.</i>
<i>Tu as vu ma chemise rouge</i>
<i>en flanelle ?</i>
<i>Sois plus précis.</i>
<i>Rouge ?</i>
<i>En flanelle ?</i>
<i>Je ne vois pas.</i>
<i>Pourquoi tu mets toujours</i>
<i>mes chemises ?</i>
<i>Parce qu'elles ont ton odeur,</i>
<i>ça me plaît.</i>
<i>J'ai besoin d'une chemise</i>
<i>pour travailler.</i>
<i>Alors, prends-la.</i>
<i>Si tu es un homme...</i>
<i>Je te propose un marché.</i>
<i>Je suis ouverte</i>
<i>à toute suggestion.</i>
<i>A ma mort, je te lègue</i>
<i>toutes mes chemises, d'accord ?</i>
<i>Ne t'inquiète pas.</i>
<i>Je ne vais nulle part.</i>
J'ai vu les nouvelles.
Ca va ?
Je ne sais pas.
<i>Ce serait un homicide mystérieux.</i>
La police a des suspects ?
<i>Un.</i>
Y compris moi.
Tu dois être dans le coin
<i>si tu as vu</i>
<i>les informations régionales.</i>
Toujours à mes trousses !
Je n'arrive pas à dormir,
encore moins à te poursuivre...
<i>Merci d'avoir appelé</i>
<i>mais j'ai besoin de réfléchir.</i>
Pour trouver le coupable ?
Tu devrais regarder
<i>ton entourage de plus près.</i>
- Je cherche quoi ?
<i>- Des pièces manquantes.</i>
On est venus
aussi vite que possible.
Du thé chinois
au citron et au miel.
Comme quand tu étais petite.
Plus tard.
Je comprends !
Quel choc en entendant
les nouvelles !
Et en plus,
la police est au courant.
J'ai expliqué pourquoi.
Oui, le mystérieux type
des poubelles.
D'après Lyle, on dirait
un cambriolage raté.
On dirait.
Tu n'y crois pas ?
Il reste des pièces manquantes
à rassembler.
Ca paraît incroyable.
Quelqu'un
entre chez vous par effraction,
fouille vos tiroirs,
tue votre amant
d'une balle dans la tête
et vous n'entendez rien.
C'est le choc, ça arrive.
A une professionnelle avertie ?
Vous avez quelque chose à dire ?
Dites-le !
Les émotions
vous attendrissent.
Que savez-vous des émotions ?
Au moins, je sais protéger
ceux que j'aime.
Assez !
C'est ça. Le Triumvirat
dit de sauter
et vous dites sur qui !
J'ai dit assez !
C'est bon
d'avoir sa famille
dans ces moments-là.
On a attrapé un homme
pas loin d'ici.
Il avait un Smith & Wesson,
et était couvert de sang,
celui de Thomas.
Son nom
- est Wade Dawson.
- Il a un casier ?
Depuis l'adolescence.
Dawson est un dealer
à la petite semaine.
Je l'ai déjà arrêté
une demi-douzaine de fois.
Il avait ça dans son sac.
Mon revolver.
Dawson dit ne l'avoir jamais vu,
mais il était défoncé
à en oublier son nom.
Il avait du sang de Thomas
sur lui ?
Comme sur l'arme.
Autre chose : en fouillant
dans les affaires de Dawson,
on a trouvé ça.
Il nous espionnait ?
Il cherchait seulement
des sensations.
Il a pensé à un cambriolage
et Thomas s'est trouvé au mauvais
endroit au mauvais moment.
J'essaie de coopérer. Dites-moi
ce que vous voulez savoir.
Alors ?
Parlez-moi de la fille
sur les photos.
J'ai pas fait de photos.
Vous pourriez
boucler un frère pour
une petite histoire...
Tu t'es camé quand ?
Il y a une heure.
Je veux dire, un an.
Je vous dirai ce que vous voulez
savoir et entendre
si vous m'aidez un peu.
Je peux pas passer
d'une came d'enfer
à rien. D'accord ?
C'est pas humain.
Ecoutez-moi.
Parlez-moi
du type que vous avez buté
et je verrai
ce que je peux faire.
Buté ?
J'ai buté personne.
Il y a erreur sur la personne !
Vraiment ?
On a trouvé l'arme du crime
dans votre sac.
Vous aviez le sang
de la victime sur votre veste.
Ecoutez,
soit vous collaborez,
soit vous finissez
votre vie en prison.
Je peux vous demander un truc ?
Quoi ?
Vous croyez qu'il y a
une chaîne porno
en prison ?
Quelle ordure !
Je vais te tuer !
Avoue, salaud !
Dis la vérité !
Dans notre douleur,
n'oublions pas
que la mort n'est pas une fin,
mais un commencement.
Nous confions le corps
de Thomas Gates à la terre
et son âme au ciel.
Que le Seigneur
l'accueille et l'aime
pour l'éternité.
Thomas n'avait pas de famille.
Ses parents sont morts
quand il était étudiant.
C'est donc à moi de dire
quelques mots sur lui.
Il était bon.
Attentionné.
Il n'a jamais cessé
de m'étonner
par l'absence d'égoïsme
avec laquelle il menait sa vie.
Il avait peu de biens matériels.
Il disait
qu'on ne les possède pas,
que ce sont eux
qui nous possèdent.
Mais il était riche
à bien d'autres égards.
C'était un être humain
plein d'amour.
Il voyait ce que les gens
ont de meilleur en eux.
Il donnait aux gens
l'impression...
d'être la personne
la plus importante au monde.
<i>J'aurais aimé te rencontrer</i>
<i>quand j'étais petit.</i>
<i>Pourquoi ?</i>
<i>Parce que toute ma vie,</i>
<i>tout ce que j'ai fait</i>
<i>jusqu'à maintenant</i>
<i>a été gâché,</i>
<i>parce que</i>
<i>tu n'en faisais pas partie.</i>
<i>Je t'aime, Parker.</i>
Je penserai souvent à lui.
Et je l'aimerai toujours.
Fais de beaux rêves, mon amour.
Tu veux autre chose ?
Encore un verre... et une machine
à remonter le temps.
En fait,
je pensais plutôt à un café
et un taxi.
Pourquoi tu ris ?
A cause de ça.
Toi et moi.
J'ai passé la plupart de ma vie
à te traquer. Dès que j'arrête,
tu me tombes dans les bras !
Même si on ne veut pas l'avouer,
on est deux pièces
du même puzzle.
Et quel grotesque petit puzzle !
Bois un coup avec moi, Jarod.
Une autre tournée pour moi et...
Allez, mon vieux Jarod !
Petit génie !
Je sais que tu souffres et je suis
désolé de ce qui est arrivé.
Mais pour trouver le coupable,
tu as besoin de tes facultés.
Finalement,
tu n'es pas si malin que ça.
Ils ont attrapé le type.
Finies, les pièces manquantes !
Il faut juste que je lui fasse
cracher le morceau
et ensuite, tout ira bien !
Ecoute-moi.
Le suspect ne parlera pas.
Comment ça ?
Celui que la police
croit coupable du meurtre
vient de mourir d'une overdose
dans sa cellule.
Les pièces manquantes...
L'avantage,
c'est que vous n'aurez pas
à subir l'épreuve d'un procès.
Vous ne comprenez pas ?
Dawson a choisi d'en finir.
Je voulais le regarder pendant
qu'on le condamnait à mort,
que mon visage soit
sa dernière vision avant l'enfer.
Vous devriez parler à quelqu'un
de ce sentiment.
Un psy, c'est ça ?
Je laisse la masturbation mentale
à d'autres.
Je veux des réponses.
Quel genre de réponses ?
Dawson se drogue comme on respire
et soudain, il fait une overdose
pendant sa garde à vue ?
Et alors ?
Dawson vivait
près de la voie ferrée.
Vous n'allez pas
fouiner chez lui !
On va fouiner chez lui.
On se croirait aux toilettes !
Il se passait
des trucs dégueulasses ici !
Un style de vie marginal.
Comment un être humain
pouvait vivre ici ?
Ce qui vivait ici
n'était pas humain.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
De la morphine pharmaceutique.
Pure.
En voilà encore.
L'inspecteur Miller a dit que
Dawson était un petit dealer.
Et alors ?
La drogue qu'on a là
est introuvable
dans la rue.
Regardez-moi ça !
Dawson dormait dans sa crasse !
Comment aurait-il trouvé ça ?
Par un fournisseur.
Un fournisseur
qui avait le bras long.
Examinez les empreintes
sur ces flacons.
Je m'en vais.
Que cherchez-vous ?
Des pièces manquantes.
<i>Tu ne parles jamais d'elle.</i>
<i>Elle était toute ma vie.</i>
<i>C'est une longue histoire.</i>
<i>J'ai perdu mes parents à 20 ans.</i>
<i>Tu sais,</i>
<i>j'étais tellement en colère</i>
<i>que je suis parti.</i>
<i>Je n'ai pas de photos d'eux.</i>
<i>Je le regrette.</i>
<i>Ca n'est qu'une photo.</i>
<i>Elle me relie à elle,</i>
<i>comme si elle me protégeait.</i>
<i>Je suis désolée, chéri.</i>
Excusez-moi.
J'ai examiné les flacons.
A part les empreintes de Dawson,
rien de clair.
Aucune chance ?
Je crains que non.
Désolé.
Merci.
On dirait que le tableau
commence à prendre tournure.
Pourquoi je me sens aveugle ?
Et chez Dawson ?
Tu sais qu'on y est allés ?
Alors ?
C'est pire qu'une porcherie.
- C'est tout ?
<i>- Il y avait de la drogue.</i>
De type pharmaceutique.
<i>De la morphine.</i>
Qu'est-ce que tu essaies
de me dire, Jarod ?
Que Dawson a été tué.
Il est mort
avec de la morphine dans le sang.
<i>C'est une overdose.</i>
D'après la police.
Il y avait aussi des traces
de strychnine. Des traces fatales.
On l'a tué avant qu'il ne parle.
<i>Comment peux-tu savoir ça ?</i>
J'ai un contact interne.
N'oublie pas...
les pièces manquantes.
Ne raccroche pas, Jarod !
C'est énervant, non ?
Il a le don de disparaître
en pleine conversation.
Selon Jarod,
Dawson a été tué.
- Par qui ?
- Il ne l'a pas dit.
Votre protégé commence
à franchement m'énerver !
Où allez-vous ?
J'ai rendez-vous chez moi
avec l'inspecteur Miller.
Vous lui faites confiance ?
Ronald Miller, 23 ans d'ancienneté,
et a épousé son amour de lycée.
Dans cette histoire,
c'est le seul à être clair !
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Un type
est rentré dans un arbre.
Qui est-ce ?
Je ne sais pas son nom,
il paraît que c'est un flic.
<i>Les pièces manquantes...</i>
Les vraies victimes de la guerre
sont toujours les innocents.
La guerre !
C'est de ça qu'il s'agit ?
Il avait 4 enfants et une femme.
Je ne peux pas...
m'empêcher
de me sentir responsable.
On est tous responsables.
Mais pas de ça.
Voici les freins de la voiture
de Miller. Ils ont été coupés.
Volontairement.
Un sabotage ?
Ron Miller était un bon flic.
Il cherchait la vérité.
C'est pour ça qu'on les a fait
taire, Dawson et lui.
Pour qu'on ne puisse pas
remonter jusqu'au Centre.
C'est leur tactique :
tuer quiconque s'intéresse
à la vérité et éliminer
ceux qu'on aime le plus.
Pourquoi ?
Pour nous contrôler.
Pour nous faire faire
leur sale boulot.
Pour moi, ça a été
mes parents et mon frère.
Et pour toi, ta mère,
et maintenant, Thomas.
Tu ne te demandes pas
comment un détenu
a pu avoir de la morphine pure
entre les mains ?
Moi, si.
Comment les arrêter ?
Grâce à la vérité.
Les pièces manquantes.
Broots, j'ai besoin de vous.
La police de Blue Cove utilise
le même matériel que moi.
J'ai pu entrer
dans leurs archives
et copier
la vidéo de surveillance.
Pas de digressions, Broots.
Dawson a eu des contacts
pendant sa détention ?
Une personne.
Je vois mal.
- D'autres angles ?
- Aucun.
Mais il tourne un peu la tête
au moment où il se lève.
Ce doit être
la drogue empoisonnée.
Dawson a dû utiliser
du chewing-gum ou de la colle
pour que ça tienne à sa semelle.
Et l'homme mystérieux ?
Voilà !
Rembobinez.
Arrêtez.
<i>Il y a eu un meurtre</i>
<i>à Briar Road !</i>
Le type des poubelles.
Qui ?
Celui qui était devant chez moi.
Je veux savoir qui c'est
et où je peux le trouver.
Les pièces manquantes !
Qu'est-ce que je peux
faire pour vous ?
On cherche quelqu'un
qui travaille ici.
Vous le connaissez ?
Pourquoi ?
On représente un groupe bancaire
et il se peut qu'on doive
de l'argent à cet homme.
Le pauvre Lester
va gagner gros ?
Possible.
Où peut-on trouver
"le pauvre Lester" ?
Il est derrière.
Lester !
Qui le demande ?
On voudrait vous parler.
Je suis occupé.
Une raison de plus
de vous tuer !
Vous voulez quoi ?
On se connaît !
Reculez, la cervelle va salir
votre costume.
Attendez !
J'ai fait ce qu'on m'a dit.
J'ai cru à une blague.
Debout !
Qui vous a dit
de venir chez moi ?
C'était qu'une voix
au téléphone.
On m'a proposé 1000 $
pour être sur place ce matin-là.
Je devais appeler les flics
et me casser.
Je vous jure.
J'ai cru
que c'était un coup monté.
Et le fait de passer de la drogue
à des détenus ?
J'avais besoin d'argent.
Je m'en doute. Et Miller ?
Celui dont on a saboté
la voiture ?
Je sais pas de quoi vous parlez.
Menteur, vous allez mourir !
C'est notre seul lien
avec l'assassin de Thomas.
Mort, il sera inutile.
Vous reconnaîtriez cette voix ?
Je crois.
Mais...
faut payer.
Ce type est du genre à rien
laisser au hasard. Vous pigez ?
Que voulez-vous ?
Quatre...
Cinq cent mille dollars.
C'est comme ça. Ou vous acceptez
ou vous me butez tout de suite.
N'importe comment,
je suis foutu.
Dawson s'est fait piéger.
Ils lui ont donné mon arme
et l'ont gavé
de morphine pure.
Il ne savait plus s'il avait tiré.
Tu ne comprends pas ?
Le type du garage est le seul
à pouvoir identifier l'assassin.
500 000 $, c'est beaucoup.
Je paierais dix fois plus
pour alléger ta douleur.
Si le Centre est impliqué,
ça doit rester entre nous.
Reçu ?
5 sur 5.
Trouve-le, ramène-le.
Qu'on en finisse
une fois pour toutes.
C'est fermé.
Restez derrière.
Lester ?
Passez-moi la torche.
Il y a du bruit !
Le moteur tourne.
Coupez-le !
Les portes et les fenêtres
sont fermées.
Ecartez-vous ! Reculez !
Eclairez !
C'est fini.
Allons-nous-en.
Papa, que fais-tu ici ?
J'ai su que tu venais ici
et on a préféré te suivre.
On n'est jamais trop prudent.
Elle a raison.
Ces gens sont des ordures.
Lui seul pouvait identifier
l'assassin de Thomas.
La chaîne est bel et bien cassée.
Appelle les nettoyeurs.
Je ne veux aucune trace du Centre.
C'est tout ?
C'est tout ce que tu vas faire ?
Je sais combien
c'est dur de perdre quelqu'un.
Cesse de chercher des réponses
qui n'existent peut-être pas.
La seule façon de survivre
est de continuer
à vivre.
Désolé, mon ange.
C'est un coup dur !
Tu vas trop
dans les cimetières.
Ils les ont tous tués.
Et pour quoi ?
La puissance ? Le contrôle ?
Que vas-tu faire ?
Je vais pleurer.
Je vais rester là
et penser à ce que j'ai perdu.
Et ensuite ?
J'attendrai qu'ils croient
que tout est... oublié.
Je trouverai les responsables
et je les ferai payer.
Regarde au pied de l'arbre.
<i>Je t'ai laissé un cadeau.</i>
<i>Poursuis ta quête</i>
<i>des pièces manquantes.</i>
Sinon, tu ne trouveras jamais
ce que tu cherches.
<i>Parle-moi de l'amour.</i>
<i>Que veux-tu savoir ?</i>
<i>Un jour, je trouverai quelqu'un</i>
<i>comme tu as trouvé papa ?</i>
<i>Je crois.</i>

NICE FELLOW
Je te tiens,
enfoiré prétentieux...
Ne me cherche pas !
Surtout avec cette arme.
Une fois, j'ai vu un type
s'en servir dans un film.
Très efficace.
Tu veux quoi, Jarod ?
Tuer ton propre coéquipier ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Tu as bien tué le tien.
Santora en savait trop, hein ?
Sur tes pots-de-vin
avec les dealers.
Sur ta planque
personnelle d'héroïne.
Tu te cames.
Santora l'a découvert
et tu l'as tué.
Je vais te buter.
Tu as tiré six coups, crétin !
Tu avais raison pour Santora.
S'il avait été
moins perfectionniste,
j'aurais pas eu à le flinguer.
T'as déjà vu ça dans un film ?
Plutôt dans un dessin animé.
Je t'ai eu !
<i>Echec et mat</i>
Encore une partie, Joshua ?
"Ca marche, Bryce.
"Pourquoi pas face à face ?"
Je savais que tu viendrais.
D'homme à homme.
Joshua ?
Surpris ?
Tu disais être au collège.
J'y étais, il y a longtemps.
Ton papa aurait dû te mettre
en garde contre Internet !
Je pensais
que tu étais mon ami !
Je suis mieux que ça.
Bien mieux.
Je suis ton frère.
Lâche-moi !
Où tu m'emmènes ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
Bravo, Doyle.
Le Minnesota a besoin de vous.
J'ai jamais vu un flic muté

Je change vite

Minneapolis a de la chance.
C'est votre famille ?

Il s'agit plutôt
de ce qu'on a pas.
Autrement dit, son fils.
Bryce Banks.
13 ans. Premier de la classe,
champion d'échecs.
Maman le borde hier soir.
Et ce matin, il a disparu.
Son père est très sévère.
Maman est bouleversée.
Je n'ose pas penser
à ce qu'ils doivent éprouver.
<i>Ils ont pris Jarod !</i>
<i>Mon fils ! Où est-il ?</i>
Inspecteur ?
Vous êtes avec moi ?
Absolument.
J'ai eu ton message.
Tout va bien ?
J'ai besoin de ton aide.
C'est Brigitte.
Je sais que la mort de Thomas
t'a affectée.
Je préférerais...
penser à l'avenir.
C'est ce que je veux faire
avec mon couple.
Mais Brigitte...
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a ?
Elle a des sautes d'humeur.
Elle a encore teint ses cheveux.
Ce matin,
elle pleurait sous la douche !
En quoi je peux t'aider ?
Parle-lui. De femme à femme.
Rapproche-toi d'elle.
Trouve ce qu'elle a.
Brigitte et moi,
on n'est pas vraiment copines.
Mon ange, je t'en prie !
Elle fait partie de la famille.
C'est un petit génie.
En matière d'échecs, Bryce
est le Michael Jordan
de l'échiquier.
Que s'est-il passé ?
On n'a pas enlevé votre fils.
En tout cas, pas d'ici.
Aucun signe de lutte.
Il n'y a que les empreintes
de votre fils.
Jamais Bryce ne se serait enfui.
Vous êtes sûr ?
Il y a autre chose, non ?
Il a cassé ça avant de partir.
Il a fait ça à cause du tournoi.
Bryce devait participer
à la finale samedi.
Il voulait faire
du skateboard
avec ses amis
et Phillip refusait.
Vous vous êtes disputés.
Je me crève pour ce petit ingrat.
C'est vrai.
Bryce a disparu.
Ca ne peut pas attendre ?
Quand vous lui avez dit
bonne nuit,
vous n'avez rien remarqué ?
J'ai vu qu'il était déçu
de ne pas aller avec ses amis.
Mais il s'est vite remis
à son ordinateur.
Il échangeait des e-mails
avec un certain Joshua.
Ils devaient se voir hier
pour la 1re fois.
Face à face.
Pour jouer aux échecs.
Joshua serait le ravisseur ?
On va le découvrir.
Une bombe
a explosé ici vers minuit.
Quel rapport ?
Le ravisseur a voulu effacer
toute trace de preuves.
Il a utilisé un explosif
très inflammable.
Comme du napalm.
Il n'a pas lésiné !
Pourquoi ne pas simplement
emmener le gosse ?
Bonne question.
On se retrouve en plein mystère.
D'après l'e-mail,
le ravisseur devait
retrouver Bryce ici.
Pourquoi cet endroit ?
<i>Université de Peachtree</i>
<i>Finale du tournoi d'échecs</i>
Un tournoi d'échecs...
Un événement.
Avec des joueurs
de tout le sud-est du pays.
Et c'est ouvert au public.
Le type est peut-être
un fan d'échecs, un dingue.
C'est plus profond que ça.
<i>On ne me laisse jamais jouer.</i>
<i>Je ne comprends pas, M. Raines.</i>
<i>Quand on est le meilleur, Jarod,</i>
<i>les gens le remarquent.</i>
Le ravisseur veut Bryce
parce que c'est le meilleur.
Il convoite un esprit supérieur.
Oui, père.
Bien. Il sera prêt
en temps voulu.
Que vas-tu me faire ?
Te donner l'immortalité.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
C'est pour toi, Joshua.
Je veux voir mes parents !
Joshua,
tu as un nouveau père.
Je m'appelle Bryce !
Tu t'appelles Joshua !
Comme moi !
Tu ne peux pas comprendre.
Mais tu es intelligent.
Tu apprendras.
Pourquoi tu me fais ça ?
Parce que tu es différent.
<i>Père</i>
<i>Ton nom est Joshua</i>
<i>Loyauté égale obéissance</i>
<i>Ton nom est Joshua</i>
On a vu tous les gens liés
au tournoi. Ca n'a rien donné.
Et pourtant,
c'est le seul endroit
où le ravisseur a vu Bryce jouer.
Ce garçon est un génie,
le trophée suprême.
Vous avez raison,
inspecteur.
Samantha Watters. Elle dresse
des profils pour le FBI.
Je m'occupe des crimes violents.
Il s'agit d'un enlèvement !
C'est peut-être plus que ça,
inspecteur. Bien plus.
Votre ravisseur
a agi comme celui
qui a enlevé 8 garçons
à la fin des années 80.
Les cas précédents
demeurent des énigmes.
Les trois derniers garçons
ont été enlevés
en 1989.
Michael Taylor,
Theodore Reed et Harry Dunn.
Ils avaient tous
entre 11 et 13 ans.
Ils étaient tous dotés
d'une grande intelligence.
Les preuves
ont été détruites à l'explosif.
On a retrouvé ces garçons ?
On en a retrouvé six,
mais ils étaient morts.
On recherche toujours
Michael Taylor et Theodore Reed.
Harry Dunn
est le dernier
à avoir été enlevé.
Vos conclusions ?
Ces enfants ne sont pas forcément
des trophées.
Ce sont peut-être des sujets.
On dirait que le ravisseur
les met à l'épreuve
et élimine les faibles.
En les laissant dans un bois ?
Vous avancez
dans l'affaire Banks ?
On a réussi à isoler
une empreinte de pied
près du lieu de l'explosion.
Je dirais
qu'il fait 1,90 m et 90 kg.
Je ne pense pas qu'il compte
sur le physique pour intimider.
Il s'agit plutôt
de contrôle affectif.
Il se faisait appeler Joshua.
Il échangeait des e-mails
avec Bryce avant sa disparition.
Je vais tout passer en revue
et j'espère établir
un profil plus complet.
- Je peux poser une question ?
- Bien sûr.
Le dernier garçon kidnappé...
celui de la photo...
au bout de combien de temps
a-t-il été tué ?
72 heures. Peut-être moins.
Brigitte !
C'est une droguée.
Que direz-vous à votre père ?
La vérité. Je n'ai pas le choix.
Ce sera votre parole
contre celle de Brigitte.
J'aurai des preuves.
Comment ?
Vous en voulez ?
Je n'ai pas vu ça
depuis longtemps !
Ils sont délicieux.
Invisible.
Bryce se définit comme ça
dans ses e-mails.
Son père était si dur
qu'il lui semblait ne pas exister.
Comme pour les autres victimes
avec leurs parents.
Surtout avec leur père.
Ils souffraient tous
de traumatismes
liés aux parents.
Ils étaient isolés du point
de vue affectif. Vulnérables.
On ne s'habitue jamais à ça.
Mais parfois,
les flics n'ont pas le choix.
J'aimerais connaître leur secret.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
De la sténo ?
C'est... ce n'est rien.
J'ai inventé ça
quand j'étais enfant
pour ne pas qu'on lise
mon journal intime.
Bryce aussi
avait besoin d'intimité.
Mais son père la lui refusait.
Son père voulait qu'il soit
ce qu'il n'avait jamais été.
Une vedette.
<i>Tournoi d'échecs pour juniors</i>
C'est ridicule ! Selon vous,
le ravisseur était au tournoi ?
C'est lamentable !
La police se trouve
dans une impasse.
Il n'a même pas demandé
de rançon.
Il n'en demandera peut-être pas.
Il tuera notre fils
quoi qu'on fasse ?
Le ravisseur a dû repérer
votre fils au tournoi.
Vous avez remarqué quelqu'un
qui s'intéressait beaucoup
à Bryce ?
Un professeur, n'importe qui ?
J'ai enseigné les échecs
à mon fils.
Il y avait ce journaliste...
Au premier tournoi de la saison.
Il m'a paru bizarre.
Comment ça ?
Il voulait faire un article
sur Bryce,
avant même qu'il ne gagne
le tournoi municipal.
Ce pourrait être lui ?
On va enquêter.
Il est temps
de faire quelque chose !
Un instant, messieurs !
A propos
du comportement de mon mari...
On comprend
qu'il soit sous pression.
Ce n'est pas une raison.
Mon fils se croit invisible
pour son père.
Il nous faut une seconde chance
pour réparer ça.
Je vous en prie.
Retrouvez mon fils.
Du nouveau ?
Jusqu'ici, rien.
On cherche des liens entre
Bryce et les autres victimes.
Amis, école, etc.
A part le fait qu'ils étaient
tous surdoués, aucune connexion.
<i>On travaille, mais c'est long.</i>
<i>Ca va ?</i>
Oui, ça va.
Je travaille avec un inspecteur,
un certain Jarod Doyle.
- Il est...
- Quoi ?
<i>Je ne sais pas.</i>
Je suis fatiguée
de cette affaire, ces enfants...
Fais attention, Sam.
C'est de la folie !
Super, on est seuls !
Tu es un gros vilain !
Je sais
que je ne devrais pas faire ça.
Mais parfois,
une femme n'a pas le choix !
Un apéro ?
Il n'est même pas 11 h.
Quoi ?
Il se passe
de drôles de trucs ici.
Où êtes-vous, Broots ?
Dans la salle de bains
de votre père.
Il se passe des choses anormales
sur un lieu de travail.
De quoi vous parlez ?
Je parle de Brigitte.
Va nettoyer ça
avant que ça ne tache
ton pantalon.
Je dois raccrocher.
Vite !
J'ai du mal à finir sans toi.
Si ton mari nous trouve ici,
c'est nous qui sommes finis.
Le journaliste
s'appelle Joshua Meyers.
Et alors ?
Le magazine pour lequel il prétend
travailler n'existe pas.
Vu cet endroit,
sa carrière non plus.
Meyers ?
Mon Dieu !
Ce type a bâti
un sanctuaire à Bryce Banks.
Notre homme ?
Mais où est le gamin ?
A terre !
Sortez !
Le ravisseur
est censé être grand.
Ce type fait moins de 1,70 m.
Où est le gamin ?
Trop tard.
Maintenant, c'est mon frère.
Tu as plein de photos
de Bryce Banks.
Qu'as-tu fait de lui ?
Il s'appelle Joshua.
Maintenant, c'est mon frère.
Petit frère, dis-moi ton nom.
Mon nom est Joshua.
<i>Ton nom est Joshua</i>
J'ai étudié les dossiers.
Il peut y avoir deux ravisseurs.
Joshua Meyers.
Son vrai nom est Theodore Reed.
Un des enfants kidnappés
qu'on n'a pas retrouvés.
Comment c'est possible ?
Il a grandi.
Mon nom est Joshua.
J'ai une bonne nouvelle
et une mauvaise nouvelle.
Brigitte va beaucoup mieux.
Mais hélas,
c'est grâce à M. Lyle.
Comment ?
Je parle de parties
de jambes en l'air.
Brigitte et mon frère ?
Vous êtes sûr à 100% ?
Disons plutôt à 80, 82%.
La drogue et Lyle ?
C'est incroyable !
Ca va briser
le coeur de mon père.
Ils ont disparu depuis 10 ans.
Maintenant,
ils enlèvent d'autres enfants.
Une pyramide humaine.
Le deuxième ravisseur pourrait
être l'autre garçon disparu.
Mike Taylor.
Il était censé être grand.
Il l'est.
Et il se fait appeler Joshua.
Bryce s'appellera aussi Joshua.
Un nouveau nom
donné par un nouveau parent.
Une figure paternelle.
Voilà le lien !
Ce sont mes frères.
Ils s'appellent Joshua.
Comme moi.
Où est le gamin ?
Tu m'as dit tout le reste.
Dis-moi où il est !
Il ne peut pas le dire.
Impossible.
Il emmènera Joshua
dans les bois.
Joshua ne veut pas
aller dans les bois.
Pourquoi ?
Qu'y a-t-il dans les bois ?
Vous me faites peur.
Joshua ne peut pas le dire.
- Pourquoi ?
- Père.
Qui est père ?
C'est toi ?
Tu ne t'appelles pas Joshua,
mais Theodore.
Theodore Reed.
Mon nom est Joshua.
Mon nom est Joshua. Joshua
ne veut pas aller dans les bois.
- A cause de père ?
- N'importe quoi pour père.
Tout pour père.
Où est le gamin ?
N'importe quoi pour père.
Tout pour père.
Ce n'est pas qu'il ne veut pas
répondre, il ne peut pas.
Il se bloque quand je pose
des questions difficiles.
Signe classique
de thérapie psychologique.
Oui, le lavage de cerveau.
On croit que la CIA a inventé ça
pendant la Guerre Froide,
mais là, ça n'est pas le cas.
Ils ont été enlevés
avant l'âge adulte.
Quand on arrache un enfant
à son foyer,
il perd le sens de la réalité.
Sans ce lien
avec ceux qu'il aime, son esprit
peut être facilement façonné.
Sa loyauté est transformée,
son intellect modelé.
Son identité change tellement
qu'il ne sait plus qui il est.
Comment savez-vous tout ça ?
Ils feront à Bryce
ce qu'on leur a fait.
Un lavage de cerveau ?
S'il est à la hauteur.
Et sinon ?
Dans 26 h,
Bryce
disparaîtra à jamais.
<i>Le temps presse.</i>
Je sais. Il faut essayer
<i>de trouver le lien entre</i>
Bryce et les autres victimes.
La figure paternelle.
Pasteurs, entraîneurs,
chefs scouts, etc.
<i>Tous ceux qui pourraient</i>
<i>remplacer leur vrai père.</i>
On y travaille, Sam.
Comment va l'inspecteur Doyle ?
J'ai encore du mal à le cerner.
<i>Bravo, Jarod, tu as gagné.</i>
<i>Alors, je peux voir mes parents ?</i>
<i>On te l'a dit. Maintenant,</i>
<i>ta famille, c'est nous.</i>
<i>Nous sommes fiers de toi.</i>
<i>J'ai presque l'impression</i>
<i>d'être ton père.</i>
J'espère ne pas vous déranger.
Comment m'avez-vous retrouvé ?
Grâce à Logan.
- Je peux ?
- Bien sûr. Pardon !
Je ne voyais pas un bon policier
vivre dans un tel endroit.
Je suis en train de changer
d'appartement en ce moment.
Pardon pour le désordre.
Ca ne me regarde pas.
C'est une longue histoire.
Que puis-je faire pour vous ?
Il y a quelque chose
qui m'intrigue.
Quoi ?
Pourquoi mentez-vous ?
Cette affaire vous perturbe.
En vous regardant interroger
Joshua en vidéo, j'ai compris.
Je ne vous suis pas.
Un enfant.
Un enfant prisonnier de son passé.
Perdu, seul, effrayé.
Ce n'est pas mon profil
que vous devez établir.
Pardon,
c'est une mauvaise habitude.
Qui êtes-vous, Jarod ?
Comment ça ?
Vous avez
un distributeur de bonbons.
Votre vie
s'étale autour de vous.
Un parfait cas d'école
d'enfance perturbée.
Vous n'avez rien
d'un cas d'école.
Ma vie n'a rien à voir
avec cette affaire.
Je crois que si.
Cet interrogatoire...
Il a échoué
parce que Joshua Meyers
est programmé pour ça.
Point final.
J'ai perdu ma mère très jeune.
Et mon père...
Mon père
n'était pas très présent.
J'ai été élevée
par un ami de la famille.
Vous avez été adopté, non ?
Si on veut.
Pourquoi cette affaire
vous tient tant à coeur ?
Disons seulement que je suis...
dévoué.
Ou plus proche de Joshua
que vous ne le dites.
J'ai suivi vos instructions.
Je comprends.
Bien, monsieur.
Votre nouveau fils
est presque prêt.
Mon nom est Joshua.
Père sera fier de toi.
Tu me déçois, Joshua.
Tu sais ce qui t'attend
si père te rejette ?
Tu iras dans les bois
et tu n'en sortiras jamais !
Jamais !
Je ne vous dirai pas
où est le gamin.
Très bien, Joshua.
Un fils doit être appelé
par son nom.
Surtout si ce nom
lui vient de père.
Un nouveau nom, une nouvelle vie.
Il t'aime,
contrairement à ton vrai père.
Mais il faut faire ce qu'il veut.
Et il veut qu'on kidnappe
des enfants innocents.
Bryce était malheureux.
Son père ne l'aimait pas.
Son nouveau père l'aimera.
Mon père.
Avant qu'on ne t'arrache
à ta famille,
tu étais malheureux ?
On ne m'a pas enlevé,
on m'a libéré.
Père ne nous force à rien,
on fait des choses pour lui.
Après tout, c'est ton père,
tu dois lui obéir.
Même s'il te demandait...
d'aller dans les bois ?
Pourquoi as-tu aussi peur
des bois ?
Parce que tes frères y sont ?
Mes frères ?
Huit d'entre vous ont été enlevés.
Mais seulement deux
sont devenus Joshua.
Les autres sont morts
dans les bois.
Arrêtez. Arrêtez de me parler.
Qu'est-ce que votre père
vous fait faire dans les bois ?
Joshua ne peut pas le dire.
Peut-être que ces photos
te rafraîchiront la mémoire.
Je ne veux pas !
Que s'est-il passé ?
Je ne veux pas regarder !
Père voulait
que tu ailles dans les bois
et que tu tues ce garçon.
Regarde les photos, bon sang !
Je suis désolé.
Je sais.
Aide-moi.
Aide-moi à sauver Bryce.
Mon ange ! Tu tombes bien.
Papa, il faut que je te parle.
En privé.
C'est ta famille.
On n'a pas de secrets.
J'ai appris que...
Excusez-moi.
- On peut vous parler ?
- Plus tard.
C'est important.
Excuse-moi une minute.
Quoi ?
J'ai analysé le contenu de...
J'ai analysé le contenu
de la seringue. C'est du pergonal.
C'est un médicament.
Contre la stérilité.
Vous en êtes sûrs ?
Brigitte essayait seulement
d'être enceinte.
Mais de qui ?
Lyle et moi, on est venus
fêter ça ici. Je n'aurais pas dû,
mais c'était plus fort que moi !
Elle a renversé
du champagne sur mon pantalon.
J'ai dû aller me nettoyer.
Tu voulais me parler ?
Ce n'est rien, papa.
Je vous laisse.
Non, attends,
on a quelque chose à te dire.
Brigitte et moi, nous allons
avoir... un petit Parker.
Vous aurez un petit frère
ou une petite soeur.
C'est formidable !
Son comportement capricieux,
ses sautes d'humeur
étaient dus au traitement.
Tu sais, les hormones...
Quelle surprise !
C'est un jour de bonheur
pour la famille.
Allons !
Ne soyez pas rabat-joie !
Tu parles de jours de bonheur...
Les bois !
<i>Eliminé</i>
Où on va ?
Faire un tour dans les bois.
Bonjour, Joshua.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Je suis père.
Je suis ton père.
N'aie pas peur.
Je suis venu te libérer.
Lâchez ce couteau !
Non, vous ne comprenez pas.
Au contraire.
Je suis son père, c'est mon fils.
Je suis Abraham.
Assez
de meurtres !
Assez !
Tout va bien, maintenant.
Tout va bien.
Inspecteur !
Merci de nous avoir donné
une seconde chance avec Bryce.
Et votre mari ?
Je ne pense pas
qu'il se rende compte.
Mais je vais faire mon possible
pour montrer à notre fils
qu'il y a autre chose
que les tournois d'échecs.
C'est un ancien psychologue
pour enfants.
Il suivait Meyers, Taylor
et les autres victimes.
Il les a détournés
de leur famille.
Son fils est mort
d'une maladie génétique.
Je parie qu'il s'appelait Joshua.
Il voulait recréer une famille.
Ils vont dans un institut
psychiatrique.
Avec un peu de chance,
ils guériront.
Et leurs parents ?
Ils les voient aujourd'hui.
Dix ans, c'est long.
Un enfant n'oublie jamais
ceux qui l'aiment.
Attendez, j'allais oublier !
C'est pour vous.
Pour moi ? Merci.
Pour l'enfant qui est en vous.
Bonne chance, Jarod.
Au revoir.

NICE FELLOW
Tu voulais me voir ?
Mon ange...
Ferme la porte, s'il te plaît.
Je pensais que nous pourrions
déjeuner ensemble.
Il y a un problčme ?
Il faut qu'il y en ait un
pour qu'un pčre invite sa fille ?
Non, mais...
Excuse-moi.
Ca va, je le mérite sans doute.
Je pensais qu'on pourrait
s'asseoir
et discuter un peu.
Ca a été dur pour toi,
ces temps-ci.
J'adorerais déjeuner avec toi.
Tant mieux.
On doit vous parler.
Seul.
Pas maintenant.
Ca devra attendre.
Impossible.
Mon coeur.
Tant pis, je n'ai plus faim.
Désolé.
Une autre fois.
J'ai intercepté une Priorité 1
d'Ellesmere.
Notre centre de recherches ?
Il y a eu une fuite.
Quelqu'un a compromis
le Projet Alpha.
Il semble que ce soit
le Major Charles.
Le pčre de Jarod ?
Il était ŕ Ellesmere ?
Il y est peut-ętre encore.
Raines, je croyais que
vous l'aviez rayé de la carte.
Moi aussi.
Si le Triumvirat apprend ça...
Il faut agir prudemment,
mais sans délai.
Renseignez-vous
sur le Major Charles
et sur cette fuite.
<i>Raines, je croyais que</i>
<i>vous l'aviez rayé de la carte.</i>
<i>Moi aussi.</i>
<i>Si le Triumvirat apprend ça...</i>
<i>Il faut agir prudemment,</i>
<i>mais sans délai.</i>
<i>Renseignez-vous sur</i>
<i>le Major Charles et cette fuite.</i>
<i>Quoi qu'il arrive,</i>
<i>personne ne doit savoir</i>
<i>ce qui est arrivé.</i>
<i>Il était ŕ Ellesmere ?</i>
<i>Il y est peut-ętre encore.</i>
<i>On m'a enlevé ŕ ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjŕ</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>ŕ cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>Il défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous ętes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Répétez, 25-bravo-tango.
<i>Je dépose un nouveau</i>
<i>dans votre petite oasis.</i>
Vérifiez. Aucune visite
n'est prévue avant le printemps.
<i>J'ai ordre de vous amener</i>
<i>un scientifique.</i>
<i>Si ça vous défrise,</i>
<i>c'est pas mon problčme.</i>
<i>Je me tire.</i>
<i>Y a un vilain front qui s'amčne.</i>
Capitaine ?
On a de la compagnie.
<i>C'est un lieu historique.</i>
<i>Il est construit</i>
<i>sur le centre de 1920.</i>
La 1re équipe,
huit personnes,
est morte de froid.
On n'a retrouvé les corps
qu'en 1940.
Depuis, le lieu est maudit.
Disons que j'ai mes raisons
de venir.
Cette photo est ancienne,
mais je crois
que cet homme est venu ici.
Vous l'avez amené ?
Pas moi.
Vous ętes le seul dingue
ŕ venir ici depuis des mois.
On est arrivés.
Vous devriez rester
en attendant que ça se calme.
Le temps me fait moins peur
que cet endroit.
Bonne chance.
Fermez la porte !
Il fait -40I dehors.
Avec le vent,
ça fait -85I,
mais ne chipotons pas.
Je m'appelle Jarod Meade.
Vous ętes le comité d'accueil ?
Je suis Smitty,
responsable radio. Et vous ?
Je suis climatologue
pour Earth Watch.
J'étudie les phénomčnes météo.
Comme El Nińo ?
A peu prčs.
L'hélico est parti ?
Personne ne s'en va.
L'hélico est parti.
Je dois m'en aller avant...
Tu vas mourir de froid
si tu sors.
Appelle l'hélico
et dis-lui de revenir.
Je ne le ferai pas, Manny.
Dis ŕ l'hélico de revenir !
C'est impossible.
Avec la tempęte,
aucun hélico ne peut venir.
- Menteur !
- C'est la vérité.
Il ne peut pas revenir.
- Qui vous ętes ?
- Jarod.
Je ferai mon possible
pour vous faire sortir.
C'est vrai ?
Posez cette bouteille.
Je ne veux blesser personne.
Je peux pas rester ici.
Je dois partir.
Ca va aller.
Votre main saigne.
Il y a un médecin ?
Je suis désolé.
Je dois partir
avant que Qallupilluit m'attrape.
Il m'a blessé ?
Vous allez vous en tirer.
Accrochez votre parka
ŕ ce crochet.
Qallupilluit ?
C'est une légende locale,
ou un truc dans le genre.
Manny est géologue.
C'est un brave gars,
mais il a tâté
un peu trop de dynamite.
Parfois, il déraille un peu,
mais je l'ai jamais vu
aussi remonté.
Quand vous aurez fini,
je vous montrerai
la ménagerie.
Quelles lettres
rendent une cime malhonnęte ?
Avec un "R" aprčs le "C",
"cime" devient "crime".
Trčs bien.
Et comment rend-on la grâce
froide ?
Vous ętes effrayants.
On étudie les effets de l'âge
sur la mémoire.
Avec de vrais jumeaux
pour référence.
Vous laisseriez la sorcellerie
le temps d'une question ?
Absolument.
Il se passe quelque chose
avec Raines.
Comme d'habitude.
Il est venu chez mon pčre
avec Lyle et le troll.
Il m'a jetée dehors.
C'est cette Priorité 1
que Raines a interceptée.
Il a intercepté quoi ?
Je ne vous ai rien dit ?
Si le Dr Freud vous libčre,
expliquez-moi de quoi il s'agit.
A propos de cette grâce...
La 1re chose qu'on apprend,
au bout du monde,
c'est que c'est l'enfer.
Capitaine, voici Jarod Meade.
Il étudie le trou dans l'ozone.
Eteignez-moi ça.
J'articule mal ?
Eteignez ça.
Je ne suis pas au courant
de votre visite.
Vous recevez
tant de scientifiques,
il y a parfois
des malentendus.
J'ai appris dans l'armée...
Les malentendus
tuent des gens.
Vous le dites tout le temps.
J'ai des gens qui étudient
les flux glaciaires,
la température des océans,
mais pas de monsieur Météo.
Mon autorisation.
J'évalue les dégâts
dans l'ozone
pour le Congrčs.
Le sénateur Bruckmeyer
en personne ?
Je vais vérifier.
Installez-le
dans la chambre d'amis.
Par ici, Ozone.
Attendez un peu
avant de tâter de la dynamite.
Gardez ce pansement.
Alors, votre main ?
Un peu douloureuse.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Raymond Moore.
On m'appelle Doc.
Enchanté, Doc.
Votre visite
nous surprend un peu.
Apparemment,
vous avez peu de visiteurs.
Les contrats sont de 12 mois.
Je suis le seul permanent.
Je suis soit dévoué,
soit fou.
Je vais lui montrer
ses quartiers.
Excusez le chantier.
Allez vous faire voir,
ma vieille !
Je suis pas un cobaye !
Arrętez de me triturer le cerveau.
A partir de maintenant,
foutez-moi la paix.
- Ecoutez, Joe...
- Joe Taylor !
Vous pouvez dire ça ?
Taylor !
- Comme vous voulez.
- Exactement.
Beth te harcčle ?
Il suffit qu'elle respire.
Vous ętes le nouveau type
d'El Nińo ?
Comment vous saviez ?
Les nouvelles vont vite
dans l'igloo, avec l'écho.
Je dois vérifier le générateur.
Vous lui avez encore demandé
ses sentiments ?
Vous n'en avez pas.
Charmant. Beth que voici
fait sa thčse
de psycho.
J'ai un ami ŕ moi
qui est psychiatre.
Vous en aurez besoin,
aprčs un moment ici.
Elle étudie quoi ?
Nous.
Un truc sur la claustrophobie.
Pourquoi les gens
se suicident ou s'entretuent
quand ils sont bloqués
par la neige.
C'est arrivé ici ?
C'est pour ça qu'elle est lŕ ?
Elle a eu une bourse
d'une boîte du Delaware.
Le Centre.
Peut-ętre.
Je m'occupe juste de la radio.
Voilŕ la chambre d'amis.
C'est pas le Westin,
mais la chasse d'eau marche.
En principe.
Normal que les visites
soient rares.
Installez-vous.
Je retourne ŕ la station.
Vous ętes tous un peu
susceptibles lŕ-dessus.
Sur les visiteurs.
Comme dit Doc,
on n'a pas de sang neuf.
Personne ?
Cet homme est venu ?
Faites-moi muter au sud
du 50e parallčle,
je vous parlerai
de ce qui se passe ici.
Quoi ?
Vous ętes sűr que c'est Jarod ?
Non, au contraire.
Ca peut jouer
ŕ notre avantage.
Je vous dirai quand
et comment procéder.
Ca y est,
c'est exactement lŕ, Harry.
<i>Je croyais que vous l'aviez</i>
<i>rayé de la carte.</i>
<i>Si le Triumvirat apprend ça...</i>
<i>Il faut agir prudemment,</i>
<i>mais sans délai.</i>
<i>Renseignez-vous</i>
<i>sur le Major Charles</i>
<i>et cette fuite.</i>
Qu'as-tu trouvé ?
Es-tu encore ici ?
<i>Accčs refusé</i>
<i>Commande d'accčs interne</i>
<i>Accčs sans code</i>
<i>Accčs refusé</i>
Vous faites quoi ?
Je regardais le temps.
Ca vous ennuie ?
Oui, si vous prenez
mon ordinateur.
Le mien n'est pas installé.
On peut partager.
Je ne "partage" pas.
Vous ne souriez pas non plus.
Personne ne sourit, ici.
Je vous en prie !
Męme pour une psy,
ça doit ętre dur
de savoir qui est claustrophobe.
C'est-ŕ-dire ?
On est tous coincés.
Le Major Charles
est arrivé lŕ il y a 3 semaines.
- Il y est encore ?
- On n'est pas sűrs.
Et le Projet ?
Tout le dossier a été ouvert.
Il sait tout.
Il y a autre chose.
Quoi ?
Jarod est arrivé.
Il y est toujours.
Envoyez des nettoyeurs !
Impossible.
La météo est contre nous.
Et ŕ l'intérieur ?
Les gens ŕ l'intérieur
sont ŕ la hauteur ?
Totalement.
J'ai indiqué comment
s'occuper de tout,
y compris de Jarod.
Tout est prévu.
On attend que le Major bouge.
On a un coup de retard.
Comme d'habitude.
Vous ici,
ŕ cette heure de la nuit ?
Smitty !
La lumičre !
Appelez Doc.
- Poussez-vous.
- Pas de pouls.
Smitty est mort.
Sűrement ŕ cause
des fumées toxiques.
Il a dű tomber,
s'assommer sur la table
et mourir étouffé.
Sacrée plaie
pour un coin de table !
Doc, emmenez Smitty
ŕ l'infirmerie
pour l'examiner.
Je ne suis pas pathologiste,
mais je verrai.
Je vais appeler.
Laissez tomber.
Ce truc est foutu.
C'est mauvais.
Il est mort ?
Il faut prévenir
les autorités et sa famille.
Impossible.
La radio est fichue.
On est coupés du monde.
Inutile de crier ŕ l'aide.
Je vous l'avais dit.
Le Qallupilluit nous aura tous !
Coincés dans la tempęte,
des gens qui meurent, pas d'issue.
Vous en ręviez, non ?
Vous n'allez pas le croire.
Le message intercepté
concernait le sabotage
d'un labo secret du Centre.
Laissez-moi deviner.
Jarod ?
Non. Le pčre de Jarod.
Le Major Charles ?
Oů ça ?
Je n'en sais rien.
Et je ne sais pas
quel était le projet.
Vous savez que
c'est important pour moi.
Oui. Je retourne au travail.
Vous pensez que le Major Charles
a tué votre mčre.
Je le sais.
Et j'ai l'intention
de régler ça.
Que votre désir de vengeance
ne trouble pas votre jugement.
Si nous trouvons le Major,
il nous sera
bien plus utile vivant
que mort.
Je ne vous ai pas entendu.
Je venais vous aider pour
l'autopsie, mais c'est trop tard.
Vous ętes aussi légiste ?
Je touche ŕ tout.
Un spécialiste l'examinera
lorsqu'on l'aura évacué.
En attendant, j'ai établi
la cause du décčs.
Alors ?
Une légčre contusion.
Pas d'autre signe de blessure.
Décčs accidentel
dű ŕ l'inhalation de fumée.
- Accidentel ?
- Il vaut mieux.
Sinon, l'un de nous l'a tué.
Jarod, venez.
- Une minute.
- Maintenant !
Qu'est-ce qui vous a pris ?
Ce n'était pas un accident.
On frise tous
la claustrophobie, ici.
Si Doc conclut ŕ accident,
c'en est un.
Il se passe des choses ici.
Smitty le savait.
Quelque chose ne tourne pas rond.
Je le sens
et vous aussi.
Si c'est le cas, les gars
seront encore plus stressés.
Et je dois maintenir le calme.
Des secours viendront.
Regardez dehors.
Ca prendra des jours.
Męme les Inuits
ne sortent pas par ce temps.
On est coincés.
Alors n'aggravez pas les choses,
compris ?
Vous m'avez fait peur.
Je vous dérange pas ?
C'est le vôtre ?
Mon fils.
Mignon.
Vous devez ętre fier.
Je ne l'ai jamais vu.
Ma femme a appris sa grossesse
aprčs mon arrivée ici.
Il me reste 2 mois ŕ tirer.
Je ne le verrai jamais.
Mais si !
Vous serez bientôt chez vous.
C'est faux.
Personne ne rentrera vivant.
Manny ?
C'est quoi, Qallupilluit ?
Une légende inuit
sur une créature maléfique
qui vit dans la glace
et tue ceux qui s'approchent.
Smitty a parlé d'un visiteur.
Vous avez vu quelqu'un ?
Le Qallupilluit est ici,
sous la station.
Je l'entends la nuit.
Oů ça ?
J'en sais rien.
Je l'entends de mon lit.
Il est dans le sol,
dans les murs, partout !
Cet homme est venu.
Vous l'avez vu ?
Je veux voir mon fils
et ma femme.
Sortez-moi d'ici !
Manny, ça va ?
Je veux que tu montres ça ŕ Doc.
Vas-y.
Manny est trčs stressé.
Alors, n'en rajoutez pas.
Pourquoi est-il stressé ?
C'est pas vos oignons.
J'ignore qui vous ętes,
mais depuis votre arrivée
les choses ont empiré...
Il a eu Doc !
Le Qallupilluit a eu Doc !
Appelez le capitaine !
Doc ?
L'incinérateur !
- Ce n'est pas un accident.
- L'un de nous l'a tué ?
Je vous ai prévenu
que les hommes étaient
au point limite !
Dites ce que vous pensez.
C'est pas moi !
Pourquoi ętes-vous allé
ŕ l'infirmerie ?
Mes points avaient sauté !
En luttant avec Doc
ou en le jetant au feu ?
Vous mettez n'importe quoi
dans la tęte des gens !
Restez ici !
Lâchez-moi, Joe !
C'est vous qui avez trouvé Doc.
Tout le monde se calme !
Vous avez dit quoi ? Et vous ?
C'est peut-ętre vous !
C'est peut-ętre aucun de nous.
Il y a peut-ętre
quelqu'un d'autre.
- Comme le Qallupilluit ?
- Il a raison.
J'ai vu un homme avec les Inuits.
Il y a 15 jours.
Joe l'a vu aussi.
C'est pas vrai.
Tu l'as vu.
T'étais avec moi.
Parlez-nous.
Je l'ai aperçu
quand ils livraient les vivres.
Vous l'avez vu partir ?
Taylor, vérifiez le générateur
et fermez la porte.
Sans électricité par ce temps,
on est morts.
Allez chercher des médicaments.
On en aura peut-ętre besoin.
Ensuite, on restera groupés
en attendant les secours.
Si les secours arrivent.
Fermez-la !
Pourquoi vous avez le revolver ?
Parce que c'est moi qui l'ai.
Faites ce que je dis.
Viens, on y va.
Je ne sais pas ce qui se passe ici,
mais j'en aurai le coeur net.
<i>Renseignez-vous</i>
<i>sur le Major Charles</i>
<i>et cette fuite.</i>
D'oů ça vient ?
Quelqu'un du Centre a envoyé
une vidéo vers un site externe.
Je n'avais
qu'ŕ trouver l'original.
Ils m'ont fait sortir pour ça.
Beau travail.
Qui l'a envoyée ?
Dur ŕ dire,
mais je sais qui l'a reçue.
Le Major Charles aurait découvert
le Projet Alpha.
Connais pas.
Nous non plus.
Il est conduit dans un labo
situé dans l'Arctique
financé par le Centre.
Le Major Charles est allé lŕ-bas.
Il y est peut-ętre encore.
Enfilez vos caleçons longs.
On part pour le nord.
Et ça va chauffer !
Tout se passe selon votre plan.
Sauf ce Jarod...
Il va poser problčme.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
Mon ange !
Pour hier...
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
C'est le revolver qui...
quand ta mčre...
Tu veux déjeuner, papa ?
Tu as un souci ?
Le Major Charles.
Pourquoi tu ne m'as rien dit ?
Tu as assez souffert.
Je ne voulais pas
te voir comme ça.
Je pars ŕ Ellesmere.
Le Major Charles
n'y est peut-ętre plus.
De quoi as-tu peur ?
Que je trouve le Major Charles,
ou ce qui l'a amené lŕ-bas ?
Ce n'est que moi.
Que faites-vous ?
Calmez-vous.
Je ne suis pas l'assassin
et vous non plus.
- On peut parler ?
- Non !
Attendez, ne partez pas.
Asseyez-vous.
Je perds la boule.
A votre avis,
que se passe-t-il ici ?
C'est dur ŕ expliquer.
C'est quelque chose d'insidieux,
qui nous détruit tous.
Comme quoi ?
Appelez ça de la folie
ou autrement, c'est pareil.
Ca se lit
dans les yeux des hommes.
C'est la capacité de faire le mal
qui dort en chacun de nous.
Quelque chose ici l'a réveillée.
Le visiteur.
Celui qu'a vu Manny.
C'était cet homme ?
Oui, c'est lui.
Lŕ, il est plus jeune,
mais c'est lui.
Je l'ai vu parler au capitaine.
Il serait encore ici ?
C'est lui qui aurait tué
Doc et Smitty ?
C'est possible.
J'ai entendu Doc dire au capitaine
qu'il était dangereux.
C'est pour ça
que j'ai pris le couteau.
Je me méfie de tous.
Sauf peut-ętre de vous.
Peut-ętre.
- Le générateur.
- Mon Dieu !
Mon Dieu, Joe !
Ne le touchez pas !
Il est mort.
Joe, réveille-toi, vieux !
Fais pas le con !
C'est vous !
D'abord, Smitty.
Puis vous avez brűlé Doc !
Arrętez immédiatement.
Puis, vous avez envoyé Joe
vérifier le générateur.
Ne m'obligez pas ŕ tirer.
Je serai pas le prochain !
Capitaine, arrętez !
Imbécile, vous m'y avez forcé.
Vous n'aviez pas ŕ tirer !
Manny, ça va ?
On vous emmčne ŕ l'infirmerie.
C'est superficiel.
Il a besoin de soins.
C'est vrai ?
Je ne suis pas l'assassin.
Jarod était avec moi.
Ce n'est pas nous.
- Ou peut-ętre vous deux.
- Ou personne.
En examinant Smitty,
je saurai peut-ętre qui l'a tué.
Vous n'examinerez
que l'intérieur du placard
oů je vous enfermerai
en attendant d'y voir clair.
Oui, enfermez-nous.
Ou ils vous tueront.
Ce sera pire
que le Qallupilluit !
Ils sont aprčs vous.
Ils sont aprčs vous !
Ils vous rateront pas !
Manny, taisez-vous !
Attendez.
On a un problčme.
J'étais ici avant la panne.
J'ai fermé la porte.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
La dynamite a disparu.
Soit vous mentez,
soit on n'est pas seuls.
- Ca tiendra un moment.
- Merci.
Les 2 générateurs ont sauté.
Il faut se couvrir.
On va sortir.
- Vous avez trouvé quoi ?
- Votre Qallupilluit.
Pour trouver l'assassin,
il faut trouver un mort.
Sidney, regardez ces nuages !
C'est un front arctique.
Je n'ai jamais vu ça.
Mlle Parker, regardez.
Je verrai ça
dans National Geographic.
Ce sera long ?
<i>Je vais devoir me poser</i>
<i>un moment.</i>
<i>Le temps est trop mauvais.</i>
Génial !
Si on ne peut pas entrer,
ils peuvent pas sortir.
Comment ça ? Quel mort ?
Aucun signe de fumée
dans ses poumons.
Il est mort avant l'incendie
d'un coup sur la tęte.
Doc aurait menti ?
Le scalpel qui aurait tué Doc
est couvert de sang O+.
Or, d'aprčs cette fiche,
le rhésus de Doc était B-.
On a vu son squelette brűler.
Le squelette de votre labo ?
Il a disparu.
- Doc a tué Smitty ?
- Et feint sa propre mort.
Mais on l'a aidé.
Joe Taylor.
Il a dű aider Doc
dčs le début.
Doc devait le tuer
pour brouiller les pistes.
Doc est toujours ici ?
Pourquoi ?
Interrogeons le capitaine.
Vous en savez plus
que vous ne le dites.
- Je le savais.
- Il n'y est pour rien.
Mais il savait
qui était le visiteur.
Et ce qu'il venait faire.
C'est ŕ vous que le Major Charles
s'est adressé.
Que savez-vous de lui ?
C'est mon pčre.
Désolée.
Il faut attendre encore 24 h
avant d'aller lŕ-bas.
Merci, capitaine.
- Ca va ?
- Impeccable.
Vous n'avez pas peur
de ce qu'on risque de trouver ?
Je n'en suis pas sűre.
C'est irréel.
C'est toute ma vie.
La mort de ma mčre,
le Centre, Jarod.
Tout mčne ŕ ce moment.
J'ai l'impression qu'une chose
sinistre nous attend.
Sens aigu
d'un malheur imminent.
Rien.
Pourvu qu'on arrive ŕ temps.
J'ai été pilote avec votre pčre.
L'unité du Cercle de Feu.
Ma femme et moi étions
trčs proches de vos parents.
On l'a aidé ŕ vous chercher.
Des années
aprčs votre disparition,
j'ai appris que le Major
avait été tué.
Il y a un peu plus d'un an,
il m'a contacté.
Pour me dire ce que le Centre
avait fait ŕ sa famille.
Il n'a jamais cessé
de vous chercher.
Il a su ce que le Centre
faisait ici,
sous couvert
de ce labo de recherche.
- Il a demandé votre aide.
- J'ai accepté.
Il voulait démasquer
le plan et retrouver sa famille.
Vous retrouver.
Je pense qu'il y a un autre labo
sur place.
Sűrement pas loin.
J'ai mis 8 mois
ŕ arriver ŕ cette conclusion.
Il est lŕ-dessous.
Ce doit ętre les restes
de la station de 1920.
Avec une modification.
Une source d'énergie indépendante.
J'ai fini par trouver les preuves
que cherchait votre pčre.
Les preuves de leurs recherches.
Ce matériel a servi
ŕ séquencer les acides aminés.
Pour quoi faire ?
Des recherches génétiques.
Les acides aminés
sont séquencés
selon des schémas
qui forment des blocs
ŕ la base de la vie :
l'ADN.
Ici, l'ADN humain.
Le Dr Moore travaillait
sur le génome humain.
C'était un généticien brillant.
Il maîtrisait le génome humain
depuis longtemps.
Lŕ oů les autres scientifiques
tâtonnent encore.
Qu'est-ce qu'un génome ?
Le schéma génétique
de la vie humaine.
Il avait trouvé la recette
de la Création ?
Exactement.
Pourquoi cacher
une telle découverte ?
Ca pouvait ętre
bénéfique pour l'humanité.
Ou déchaîner le Qallupilluit.
Quel était le projet du Centre ?
Votre pčre avait percé
leur secret.
Ces recherches leur servent ŕ...
Je savais
que vous n'étiez pas météorologue.
- Qu'avez-vous fait de mon pčre ?
- Hélas, rien !
Il est parti
avant que je l'attrape.
C'est lui qui m'a obligé
ŕ faire tout ça.
Vous les avez tous tués ?
Oui, Manuel.
Et la dynamite ?
Personne ne doit rien savoir.
Tout explosera dans 3 minutes.
Mais ne craignez rien.
Beth, attention !
Ca va ?
Il est mort.
Capitaine ?
Je vous tirerai de lŕ.
Pas le temps.
Evacuez Beth et Manny
avant que ça saute.
Prenez ça. Mes amis inuits
sont sur cette fréquence.
Ils vous aideront
comme votre pčre.
Mon pčre ?
Je l'ai envoyé
chez ma fille.
Donnez-lui ceci.
Dites ŕ ma fille
que je l'aime.
Je lui dirai.
C'est promis.
Qu'avait trouvé mon pčre ?
Ils ne travaillaient pas
sur n'importe quel génome.
C'était le vôtre.
Il faut y aller.
Elle a raison.
Faut y aller.

NICE FELLOW
L'enfer doit ressembler ŗ Áa.
On dirait un vieux labo
de recherche.
Que pouvait chercher
le pŤre de Jarod ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Le dťtonateur d'un systŤme
incendiaire.
Jarod ne voulait pas qu'on sache
ce qui se passait ici.
Pourquoi couvrir ses traces ?
Ce n'est peut-Ítre pas lui
qui a mis la bombe.
Alors qui, et pourquoi ?
La serrure du coffre d'Al Capone ?
Un vieux truc brŻlť.
Mlle Parker ?
Oui, Sam ?
On a un autre corps.
- Ce serait Jarod ?
- Non.
Il m'a fait le coup du phťnix
une fois de trop.
<i>Donnez-lui ma bague</i>
<i>et cette photo.</i>
<i>- Dites ŗ ma fille que je l'aime.</i>
<i>- Promis.</i>
<i>Qu'avait trouvť mon pŤre ?</i>
<i>Ils ne travaillaient pas</i>
<i>sur n'importe quel ADN.</i>
<i>C'ťtait le vŰtre.</i>
Des dťmons habitent vos rÍves.
En visite.
Ceux qui vous ont nui
ťtaient ŗ la base de recherche.
Qu'ont-ils trouvť ?
Ce qu'ils cherchent
n'y est plus.
Avant de partir, votre pŤre
m'a dit qu'il allait
vous trouver.
Il contemplait la Constellation,
en parlant du fils
qu'il trouverait un jour.
La Constellation ?
Les Gťmeaux.
Il m'a demandť
de vous donner Áa.
C'est lui ? C'est mon pŤre ?
Les Gťmeaux...
Ca signifie quoi ?
Il y a un message.
Vous le trouverez lŗ.
C'est lŗ que vous trouverez
votre pŤre.
<i>On m'a enlevť ŗ ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble dťjŗ</i>
<i>plus douť que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>ŗ cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon ťvasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passť.</i>
<i>C'est un Camťlťon.</i>
<i>Un gťnie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De prťfťrence.</i>
<i>Il dťfend les opprimťs.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous Ítes mťdecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
J'ai reÁu un appel du Triumvirat.
Le grand Matumbo en personne
sait que Jarod et son pŤre ťtaient
dans l'Arctique et que notre projet
a ťtť dťcouvert.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit ?
En dehors du fait que Jarod
y soit encore, il ťtait ravi.
Pour lui, la dťcouverte du projet
est un "signe de Dieu".
Etrange, venant d'un athťe.
Matumbo a ordonnť l'accťlťration
du Projet Gťmeaux. On doit livrer
d'urgence.
- C'est un problŤme ?
- Non.
Mais Mlle Parker
risque d'en Ítre un.
Telle mŤre, telle fille.
Catherine ťtait contre.
Le secret est la clť
de ce projet.
Je m'occupe de ma fille.
Tout ira bien.
<i>J'ai fini mon immeuble.</i>
<i>J'ai fini !</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h,</i>
<i>il semble dťjŗ plus douť</i>
<i>que les autres.</i>
<i>J'ai fini !</i>
<i>Jarod, je m'appelle Sidney.</i>
<i>Je vais m'occuper de toi.</i>
<i>Pourquoi ?</i>
<i>Oý sont mes parents ?</i>
Ca ne me regarde pas,
mais parfois, les souvenirs
ne mŤnent nulle part.
TrŤs juste.
Ca ne vous regarde pas.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Les corps de l'Arctique
n'ťtaient pas Jarod.
Comment s'est-il ťchappť
de cet enfer ?
Jarod a toujours dťfiť la logique.
C'est froid, l'Arctique.
- Presque autant que le Centre.
<i>- Dieu merci !</i>
- Tu t'en es sorti.
<i>- De justesse.</i>
Mais j'ai dťcouvert des choses.
- Raconte.
<i>- Vous Ítes exclu du cercle ADN ?</i>
- Ou plutŰt de la sťquence.
<i>- Je ne savais pas</i>
qu'on avait une base lŗ-bas.
- Personne ne savait.
<i>- Ils remuent</i>
la soupe gťnťtique, en travaillant
sur le gťnome humain.
Et pas n'importe lequel.
Le mien.
- Tu as trouvť ton pŤre ?
<i>- Non, mais je sais</i>
qu'il a risquť sa vie
pour dťcouvrir Áa.
Le mot "Gťmeaux"
vous dit quelque chose ?
Le signe du Zodiaque ?
- Pourquoi ?
<i>- J'interrogerai mon pŤre.</i>
Je vais le voir.
- Tu sais oý il est ?
<i>- Les ťtoiles me guideront.</i>
Je vous ai toujours connu.
Vous connaissiez ma mŤre.
Vous l'avez vue
juste avant sa mort.
J'y vais.
Assis.
Je vais vous poser une question
et je veux la vťritť.
Que voulez-vous savoir ?
Ma mŤre a-t-elle parlť
d'un projet,
d'un code de rťfťrence
en rapport avec le mot "Gťmeaux" ?
Navrť. Jamais entendu parler.
Mon pŤre, M. Raines et Lyle
me cachent
un gros truc,
un certain Projet Gťmeaux.
Comme les jumeaux ?
M. Ignorant ne pouvant nous aider,
je vais...
Non.
Nous allons ťclaircir Áa.
Pardon. Le numťro 7 ?
Lŗ-bas.
Oý est-il ?
Pitiť !
Oý est mon pŤre ?
Jarod ?
Ca va, Koop ?
Oui, Sarah.
Retourne travailler.
- Tu es sŻr ?
- Absolument. Vas-y.
Vous Ítes Jarod ?
- Le fils du Major ?
- Oui.
- Oý est-il ?
- Il est parti en h‚te.
- On le traquait.
- Des hommes en limousine ?
Le plus mťchant ťtait une femme.
Brune ?
Blonde.
Avec une sucette.
Elle vient de partir.
Mon pŤre est blessť ?
C'est mon sang.
Ils m'ont cognť contre le mur,
presque cassť le nez.
Je pensais que vous ťtiez
avec eux.
Dťsolť que vous soyez mÍlť ŗ Áa.
J'ai rien dit.
Jurť. Je ferais tout pour le Major.
Nos conversations
me manqueront.
Il est venu souvent ?
De temps en temps,
ces 20 derniŤres annťes.
Je ne savais jamais oý il allait,
mais c'ťtait toujours
sur vos traces.
Il vous a dit oý il allait ?
Non, par prudence.
Vous en avez un autre ?
Bien sŻr.
Tu as un autre annuaire ?
Oui, tiens.
Vous cherchez quoi ?
Ce qui n'y est pas.
Une dťcouverte ťtrange.
Un cheveu sur votre tÍte ?
Ce serait un fantasme,
or ceci est rťel.
Un mťmo interne ?
TrŤs ancien.
De votre mŤre au Triumvirat.
"Je suis en dťsaccord
"avec M. Raines
sur le Projet Gťmeaux.
"Malgrť les progrŤs humains
de Pakor,
"je ne peux encourager
la poursuite du projet.
"Il reprťsente un progrŤs
pour l'humanitť,
"mais je doute que celle-ci puisse
un jour assumer ses ramifications.
"Catherine Parker."
- On l'a tuťe quelques jours aprŤs.
- Les Gťmeaux.
C'est ce dont parlait
votre pŤre ?
- Maman s'y opposait.
- Je cherche
des choses sur les Gťmeaux,
mais je ne trouve rien.
Continuez.
Et renseignez-vous sur Pakor.
<i>Attention, le cours du groupe B-5</i>
<i>aura lieu aujourd'hui en salle 204.</i>
<i>Veuillez en prendre note.</i>
Excusez-moi.
Je cherche quelqu'un.
Avez-vous vu cet homme ?
Le nouvel instructeur ?
- Il est ici ?
- DerriŤre vous.
Pas derriŤre vous, ici.
DerriŤre, lŗ-haut !
Il a une radio ?
Il a presque fini.
Vous le connaissez ?
C'est mon pŤre.
Touchť !
Papa !
Mon Dieu, c'est Dan Wilson !
C'est tragique. Dan a pris
l'avion de votre pŤre.
Le Major Charles
a ses quartiers lŗ-bas.
Votre pŤre a dŻ partir
tŰt ce matin.
Un dťpart prťcipitť, on dirait.
Merci.
Donnez-moi une raison
de ne pas vous tuer.
Carey.
Votre pŤre m'envoie.
Mon pŤre ?
Il m'a donnť Áa pour vous.
Mon pŤre est mort ?
Je n'ai pas trouvť
ce que je cherchais,
rien sur les Gťmeaux ni sur Pakor,
mais quelque chose
sur les cachotteries de votre pŤre.
- Et ?
- Je suis sŻr
que Áa concerne le pŤre de Jarod.
Ils savent oý il est.
Vote pŤre et Raines s'intťressent
ŗ une victime de l'Arctique.
Le capitaine Russ Osborne.
Raines le soupÁonne
d'avoir ťtť pote
avec le Major Charles
et de l'avoir aidť ŗ fuir le labo.
- On a une adresse ?
- La seule famille d'Osborne,
c'est sa fille.
Elle tient une ťcole d'aviation
en Caroline du Nord.
On suppose...
Que le Major Charles y est.
- Sid est au courant ?
- Non.
Il a passť la journťe en rťunion.
Trouvez-le.
Il se libťrera pour Jarod.
On est partis.
Qu'est-ce que
vous attendez, Broots ?
C'est que...
A propos des cachotteries
de votre pŤre...
Le registre du Centre.
Mon pŤre a dťjŗ envoyť Brigitte.
<i>La cause de l'accident</i>
<i>reste ŗ dťterminer,</i>
<i>mais de nombreux tťmoins</i>
<i>de l'ťcole Osborne</i>
<i>disent avoir entendu</i>
<i>une dťtonation...</i>
Le pŤre de Jarod
n'est pas mort.
Moi aussi, je serais malade.
Excusez-moi.
Ca recommence.
Nausťes matinales. C'est le prix
ŗ payer pour avoir un hťritier.
Certains ont disparu
pour moins que Áa.
Ca suffit.
Non, Áa ne suffit pas.
Tu as envoyť
une incapable faire un travail
qui me tenait ŗ coeur.
Il s'agit de l'homme
qui a tuť maman
et tu t'es mťfiť de moi ?
Honte ŗ toi !
Aux pŤres !
Aux pŤres.
La derniŤre fois
que j'ai eu mon pŤre, il m'a dit
avoir revu un ami dans l'Arctique.
Mon pŤre.
Il l'admirait beaucoup.
Pour son courage
et sa tťnacitť.
Ils cherchaient ensemble
ŗ dťmasquer ce laboratoire.
Je regrette
qu'il n'ait pas pu
aller jusqu'au bout.
Votre pŤre
ne sera pas mort en vain,
je vous le promets.
Mais pour arrÍter ce qui se passe,
je dois retrouver mon pŤre.
Il ne vous a rien dit
qui puisse m'aider ?
Il passait son temps ŗ lire
et ŗ travailler sur son portable.
Et il adorait voler.
Il appelait Áa sa dťlivrance.
Il est parti en h‚te.
Il m'a dit
qu'on le recherchait en ville,
qu'il ťtait temps de filer
et m'a fait promettre
de planquer sa voiture.
Vous avez sa voiture ?
- Alors ?
- J'ai trouvť un tťlťphone.
<i>Les Surgelťs Pakor sont fermťs.</i>
<i>Nous sommes ouverts de 8 ŗ 17h...</i>
Qu'avez-vous trouvť ?
Avec un peu de chance,
mon pŤre.
Sidney, vous ne venez pas
en Caroline du Nord ?
De nouveaux devoirs m'appellent.
Depuis quand Jarod
n'est pas prioritaire ?
J'adore causer philosophie
mais lŗ, je suis occupť.
Et vous devez partir.
Je vous appelle. Bonne chance
pour vos nouveaux devoirs.
J'ai un bureau, vous savez.
Les Gťmeaux.
On ne parle pas des Gťmeaux
aux toilettes du niveau 10.
Les Gťmeaux ?
Les secrets sont rares, M. Parker.
Hťlas, c'est un fait.
Que voulez-vous, Sidney ?
Je veux les Gťmeaux.
Si c'est ce que je crois, je veux
Ítre coordinateur du projet.
Raines risque d'Ítre contre.
MÍme Raines ne peut nier
que je suis le plus qualifiť.
- Il y a des jeunes.
- Combien ont Jarod
sur leur C.V. ?
Bon argument.
Je vais y songer.
Une question : si Jarod
ťtait encore au Centre,
voudriez-vous diriger les Gťmeaux ?
Si Jarod ťtait encore au Centre,
les Gťmeaux seraient inutiles.
Du calme. Je suis plus mťchante
que j'en ai l'air.
Pour m'effrayer,
les talons ne suffisent pas...
Jarod a quittť la ville ?
Je l'ai trouvť ici
et je l'ai virť.
Il m'a seulement parlť
d'aller en Floride.
Merci du dťrangement.
On descend dans le sud ?
Elle ment.
Direction le nord.
ProblŤme de sťcuritť
dans l'aile est.
Dieu du ciel, c'est toi !
Papa !
Laisse-moi te regarder.
Ca fait si longtemps !
<i>C'est toi !</i>
Ils se sont trouvťs.
Mais qu'ont-ils trouvť d'autre ?
Le Major a touchť le gros lot.
Il est parti avec des copies
des fichiers sur les embryons.
Alors, ils ne tarderont plus
ŗ dťcouvrir Donoterase.
Je vais parler ŗ Matumbo.
A votre place,
je rattraperais
les erreurs du Centre
et prierais pour la clťmence
de Matumbo.
Dis-lui que tout baigne
et qu'on a h‚te
de le voir.
Dans le doute, mens.
Mon coeur ?
Trouve Jarod et son pŤre.
Appelez Donoterase
et transfťrez les Gťmeaux
dans 24 heures.
C'est un endroit modeste,
mais sŻr.
Ca ressemble ŗ mes cachettes
au fil des ans.
Tel pŤre, tel fils.
Que de nuits blanches passťes
ŗ me demander comment tu serais,
ŗ quoi tu ressemblerais.
Mais toutes ces nuits
ne m'empÍchent pas
d'Ítre terriblement nerveux.
Tu m'as tant manquť.
Les premiŤres semaines
aprŤs ton enlŤvement,
on survivait gr‚ce aux priŤres.
J'ai vite compris
que pour te trouver, il faudrait
le faire nous-mÍmes.
Toutes ces annťes ŗ fuir...
C'ťtait comme si,
partout oý nous allions,
les Nettoyeurs ťtaient aprŤs nous.
Je connais Áa.
Maintenant qu'on est ensemble,
la douleur s'est envolťe.
J'ai h‚te de voir maman et Emily.
Moi aussi.
Je les cherche
depuis presque
aussi longtemps que toi.
En voulant te libťrer,
je les ai perdues.
Qu'est-il arrivť ?
Une certaine Catherine Parker
a voulu m'aider,
mais Áa a mal tournť. Le Centre
m'a rattrapť. Une fois en sŻretť,
je suis rentrť.
Ta mŤre et Emily
avaient disparu.
J'ignore si elles vivent encore.
Bien sŻr.
Je les ai vues, il y a deux ans.
Dieu soit louť.
Nous les trouverons ensemble.
Ce n'est pas tout.
Kyle.
- Il est...
- Je sais. Je l'ai appris.
Je suis arrivť sur place
2 jours aprŤs le meurtre
de ton frŤre.
Mais je suis fier de toi.
C'est ťpatant, aprŤs ce que tu as
endurť, d'aider les autres.
J'aimerais pouvoir revendiquer
ton ťducation,
j'aurais voulu Ítre avec toi.
Il y a...
une chose qui me tracasse.
Une chose
que je refuse de croire.
As-tu tuť Catherine Parker ?
A ton avis ?
Donoterase.
- Vous connaissez ?
- Ca fait Commedia dell'arte.
Hier, en salle de communication,
j'ai interceptť un appel de Raines
vers Donoterase.
Votre pŤre a ordonnť
le transfert des Gťmeaux
dans 24 heures.
- On sait oý c'est ?
- J'y travaille.
La vidťo-surveillance
de Jarod et son pŤre.
En plus d'avoir trouvť son fils,
le Major a volť des donnťes.
Il semblait se moquer
d'Ítre vu.
Pour descendre ma mŤre ŗ midi
en plein Centre, il faut du cran.
Renseignez-vous sur ces donnťes.
J'ai lancť une recherche
sťquentielle anonyme.
- C'est un local du Centre ?
- Et cette vidťo
vient d'une base secrŤte
ŗ Baltimore
cachťe
sous le nom
de Surgelťs Pakor.
Pakor.
Ma mŤre
en parlait dans son mťmo
sur les Gťmeaux.
Pourquoi le pŤre de Jarod
s'y intťresserait ?
Et quel rapport
avec votre mŤre ?
J'aimerais le savoir.
Les donnťes qu'il a volťes.
Il n'y a pas que le maÔs
qui soit surgelť, lŗ-bas.
C'est quoi, ce cauchemar ?
Rťveille-toi.
Ca va aller.
Ce n'est qu'un mauvais rÍve.
Je n'ai jamais bien dormi.
Ce que j'ai trouvť ne t'aidera pas.
J'ai rťussi ŗ dťcoder un fichier.
Le Centre se surpasse.
Les Surgelťs Pakor
font du stockage biologique.
Organes, placenta,
vaches, moutons,
chevaux et j'en passe.
C'est l'arche infernale !
Et le vieux Noť...
Des embryons humains.
Quoi ?
Il y a un an,
la recherche de mon passť
m'a conduit
au centre de fťconditť
oý maman ťtait allťe.
J'ai dťcouvert
qu'il appartenait au Centre.
Ils ont pris les ovules
de ta mŤre.
Je crois que le Centre
les tient congelťs chez Pakor.
Les Gťmeaux.
J'ignore le sens de tout Áa,
mais c'est ŗ Donoterase
que Áa se passe.
Vous avez trouvť Donoterase ?
Oui, et le Centre
avait bien cachť cet endroit.
C'est ŗ 20 km. Les Gťmeaux
seront transfťrťs de lŗ.
Si on a trouvť,
Jarod et son pŤre aussi.
D'aprŤs mes donnťes, c'est ici.
- Il n'y a rien.
- C'est ce qu'on est censť croire.
C'est Áa, Donoterase ?
Je ne comprends pas.
C'est quoi ?
Des traces de pneus. Doubles.
Vťhicule utilitaire.
Reste ŗ savoir
ce qu'il transporte et oý.
Que faites-vous ici ?
Je ne suis pas si vieux.
Il mijote quoi, Noť ?
C'est l'heure de le dťplacer.
Que faites-vous ici ?
Vous pensiez
pouvoir me cacher les Gťmeaux ?
Je vais vous faire un aveu :
j'adore qu'on me sous-estime.
Vous allez me dire
ce qui se passe ici ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Du bťtail de synthŤse.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites lŗ ?
Je rÍve !
Attrapez-les !
Poussez-vous !
Qui ťtait-ce ?
Tu as l'air d'avoir vu un fantŰme.
Pas un fantŰme.
Ce garÁon, c'est moi !
Ils m'ont clonť !
Je te mets un pansement d'appoint.
Je nettoierai Áa plus tard.
- Oý allons-nous ?
- Loin du Centre.
Il faut y retourner.
- Non. Tu es blessť.
- Ca ira. Il faut y retourner.
Toute ma vie, j'ai cherchť
la famille que le Centre
m'avait volťe.
Maintenant que je t'ai retrouvť,
pas question de te perdre.
Il ne s'agit pas de moi,
mais de lui.
J'ignore qui il est
ou ce qu'il est.
C'est un enfant.
Il fait partie de nous.
Le Centre a fait
des choses innommables,
mais crťer un enfant...
Comment ont-ils pu ?
Il y a des annťes,
ils m'ont demandť
de simuler un clonage.
On implante une cellule contenant
l'empreinte ADN dans un ovule hŰte.
L'oeuf nouvellement fťcondť
se transforme en embryon
qu'on implante
sur une mŤre porteuse.
Voilŗ pourquoi
ils avaient les ovules de ta mŤre.
Ils ont implantť mon ADN
dans un de ses ovules.
Ca n'aurait pas dŻ arriver.
Mais c'est arrivť et ce garÁon
fait partie de notre famille.
On ne peut pas l'abandonner
au Centre.
Il nous faut un alliť.
Tu as un ami au Centre ?
Dites-moi
que vous n'y Ítes pour rien.
- Dans quoi ?
<i>- Ils ont volť mes gŤnes</i>
et ils m'ont clonť
comme un animal.
Il y a eu des rumeurs.
- Je refusais d'y croire.
<i>- Croyez-le.</i>
<i>Je l'ai vu.</i>
<i>Je me suis vu.</i>
J'ai vu mon reflet
avec 20 ans de moins.
Mon Dieu !
Ca dťpasse les mots.
<i>Vous Ítes</i>
<i>mon seul ami au Centre.</i>
Aidez-moi.
Je ferai mon possible.
Il est splendide.
Un peu nerveux.
Il n'a jamais quittť Donoterase.
Je comprends que le secret
soit la clť des Gťmeaux.
Et que maman ait ťtť contre.
- Mon ange...
- Pas de Áa !
Tout le monde savait, sauf moi.
C'ťtait un ordre du Triumvirat.
Moi-mÍme, je ne l'ai su que tard.
C'est un spťcimen ťtonnant, non ?
Jusqu'oý descendrons-nous ?
Tu as un souci ?
Tu as laissť Raines
se prendre pour Dieu.
Votre pŤre ne m'a rien
"laissť" faire.
Les Gťmeaux ont toujours ťtť ŗ moi.
Manipulation gťnťtique,
clonage...
C'est la pointe
de la technologie.
Bienvenue dans le 3e millťnaire.
Nous avons 20 ans
d'avance
sur les cloneurs de mouton.
Nous produisons d'excellents boeufs
en Argentine.
Tous exactement pareils.
C'est un progrŤs.
Raines n'a pas crťť
un meilleur Big Mac,
il a crťť un Ítre humain.
Mon Dieu !
C'est Jarod enfant.
Ne me dites pas
que vous saviez.
Seuls nous quatre savions,
ainsi que le Triumvirat.
Sidney, j'ai songť ŗ votre requÍte.
C'est acceptť.
Je suis comblť. Merci.
Quelle requÍte ?
Je nomme Sidney
coordinateur du projet.
A lui de le comparer
ŗ l'original.
Pas question qu'il teste
mon Camťlťon !
Il n'est pas ŗ vous,
mais au Triumvirat.
Avant livraison, il sera ťvaluť
par celui qui connaÓt
le mieux Jarod !
Vous allez vous mÍler
ŗ Áa ?
Je m'appelle Sidney.
Je vais m'occuper de toi.
Oý sommes-nous ?
Dans un repaire de chasse.
Toi, ta mŤre et moi
faisions du camping.
Un orage a ťclatť
et a tout inondť.
On est venus s'abriter ici.
C'est drŰle.
- Je ne m'en souviens pas.
- Elle est toujours lŗ.
- Quoi ?
- La cicatrice.
Tu amusais ta mŤre.
Tu as grimpť cette ťchelle
pour la faire rire et tu es tombť.
Tu t'es ouvert le dos.
Nous ťtions tous les trois.
Pendant 2 jours,
c'ťtait comme si on ťtait
seuls au monde.
C'ťtait une semaine
ŗ peine avant...
Que le Centre m'enlŤve.
Catherine Parker
m'a dit des choses.
Le Centre t'a fait
des choses affreuses.
Ca n'a plus d'importance.
Pour moi, si.
Que t'ont-ils fait ?
<i>Je n'y arrive pas, Sidney !</i>
<i>- Il le faut !</i>
<i>- Combien j'ai d'oxygŤne ?</i>
<i>- Moins de 48 h.</i>
<i>- La cause de l'explosion ?</i>
<i>On l'ignore.</i>
<i>- Carburant ?</i>
<i>- Les jauges sont ťteintes.</i>
<i>Il en reste peu.</i>
<i>- OxygŤne ?</i>
<i>- C'est fini !</i>
<i>- Concentre-toi !</i>
<i>- Rien ne peut nous sauver !</i>
<i>C'est ton devoir</i>
<i>de sauver ton ťquipage.</i>
<i>Je n'y arriverai pas.</i>
<i>Bien sŻr que si !</i>
<i>Si tu abandonnes,</i>
<i>on mourra tous.</i>
<i>Toi aussi !</i>
Attendez.
<i>La force gravitationnelle</i>
<i>de la Lune nous ramŤnera.</i>
Pas mal !
Tu pouvais nous sauver
si tu le voulais.
C'est trŤs bien.
85 secondes
de moins que Jarod.
Avec les donnťes scientifiques
disponibles aujourd'hui,
sa performance vaut celle de Jarod.
En tout cas, Áa prouve
ses capacitťs.
J'ai h‚te de le montrer ŗ Matumbo.
Tu parles comme
un entraÓneur de chevaux.
Un problŤme moral, Mlle Parker ?
Que savez-vous de la morale ?
Ne m'adressez plus
la parole.
Je n'arrive pas ŗ croire
que vous participiez ŗ Áa.
Vous voulez revivre
votre jeunesse tordue ?
Vous savez ce qu'ils ont fait
pour crťer ce garÁon.
Votre expťrience vous manque
au point d'accepter une rťplique ?
Vous ne comprenez pas.
En effet.
J'espŤre ne jamais comprendre.
C'est un excellent dťbut.
MÍme votre mŤre
aurait reconnu le succŤs total
du Projet Gťmeaux.
Total, mes fesses !
Je ne tiens pas ŗ aborder
- ce sujet.
- Le clonage ?
Non, vos f...
Oui, le clonage.
Je ne comprends pas
que Sidney y soit mÍlť.
Rien ne m'ťtonne plus,
dans cet asile de fous.
- C'est sŻr !
- Pourquoi cacher ce projet
s'il n'y a rien ŗ cacher ?
Je saurai la vťritť,
ce qui s'est vraiment passť.
Et je vais vous aider ?
Ramenez vos fesses.
J'ai dťviť les dťtecteurs.
On a 30 mn avant d'Ítre dťcouverts.
Alors, ouvrez l'oeil
et bouclez-la.
Pas de problŤme.
Je ne tenais pas ŗ venir.
Regardez.
Ils devaient le garder ici.
Pas terrible, pour passer
les 14 premiŤres annťes de sa vie.
Jolie vue.
Par ici !
"Dissection des anomalies
sur spťcimens."
C'est quoi ?
Un musťe des horreurs.
Ca sent quoi ?
Le formol.
C'est jamais bon signe.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Je crois que ce sont les "avant".
Avant quoi ?
Avant qu'ils sachent
ce qu'ils faisaient.
C'ťtait pareil
avec les 1ers clones de moutons.
Ils n'ont pas crťť Dolly
du 1er coup. C'ťtait la 375e.
Et les 37 4 autres ?
Elles ont fini comme Áa.
Des mutantes.
Seulement,
ce n'ťtaient pas des humains.
Regardez Áa.
Le corps d'un enfant
et le visage... du colonel Sanders.
Ca s'appelle le gťrontisme.
Un problŤme gťnťtique qui accťlŤre
le vieillissement chez l'enfant.
Il peut avoir 7 ans
et un corps de centenaire.
Regardez-moi Áa !
Raines s'est pris pour Dieu.
Et il a rťveillť le diable.

NICE FELLOW
<i>Dans l'épisode précédent...</i>
<i>Ils remuent</i>
la soupe génétique en travaillant
sur le génome humain.
Et pas n'importe lequel.
Le mien.
Dieu du ciel, c'est toi !
Papa !
Que de nuits blanches passées
à me demander
à quoi tu ressemblerais.
Tu m'as tant manqué !
Je veux la vérité.
- Ma mère a parlé des Gémeaux ?
- Jamais entendu parler.
Que voulez-vous ?
Je veux les Gémeaux.
Les Gémeaux
ont toujours été à moi.
C'est un excellent début.
Le Projet Gémeaux
est un succès total.
- Raines s'est pris pour Dieu.
- Et il a réveillé le diable.
<i>Ce garçon, c'est moi.</i>
<i>Ils m'ont cloné !</i>
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>à cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>Il défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Qu'est-ce qu'ils t'ont fait ?
<i>Je n'arrive pas</i>
<i>à ouvrir la vanne !</i>
<i>J'ai trop chaud pour penser !</i>
<i>Je brûle !</i>
<i>Je peux les sauver !</i>
<i>C'est ta dernière chance.</i>
<i>J'ai dit la vérité.</i>
<i>Je suis serein.</i>
<i>Je suis fatigué.</i>
<i>Mes jambes me font mal.</i>
<i>Je me suis immolé</i>
<i>pour faire passer un message.</i>
<i>Ca fait trois jours.</i>
<i>Il fait plus de 100l.</i>
<i>Il faut te rendre.</i>
<i>Pas moi.</i>
<i>Je ne céderai jamais.</i>
On est ensemble.
C'est ce qui compte.
Ca...
et sauver l'enfant.
Je suis dans l'unité centrale.
Ils me tiennent.
Mais je tiens les Gémeaux. Le petit
va être transféré au Triumvirat.
Quand ça ?
Aucune idée.
Ils m'ont coupé.
Il doit y avoir un autre moyen
de savoir.
Quelqu'un qui nous le dise.
Sidney, répondez !
Je réponds à votre place ?
C'est sans importance.
Voici le topo.
La date du transfert
du jeune Caméléon est avancée.
Il part à l'aube.
Je n'aurai pas terminé.
C'est inévitable. Jarod et son père
ont pénétré l'unité centrale.
Mon père dit
que vous pourrez continuer
votre travail là-bas.
Nous comptons sur vous.
Vous pouvez.
<i>Je suis en désaccord</i>
<i>avec M. Raines</i>
<i>sur le Projet Gémeaux.</i>
<i>Malgré les progrès humains</i>
<i>de Pakor, je ne peux encourager</i>
<i>la poursuite du projet.</i>
<i>Il représente un progrès</i>
<i>pour l'humanité,</i>
<i>mais je doute que celle-ci</i>
<i>puisse un jour</i>
<i>assumer ses ramifications.</i>
<i>Catherine Parker.</i>
Vous avez à boire ?
Quelque chose de fort.
Pour vous rincer le palais ?
Non, l'âme.
J'ai consulté les registres
de Donoterase.
Au fil des ans,
ils ont fécondé
289 ovules
avant de réussir le garçon.
Nous avons vu les résultats
au labo.
Une partie.
C'est dur à croire,
mais ce n'était pas
le plus bizarroïde. Les ovules
ne pouvaient pas être incubés.
Il fallait des matrices.
Des mères porteuses.
Raines trouvait lui-même
les femmes.
Le plus souvent,
des déshéritées solitaires
ou dans le coma.
Qu'on ne réclamerait pas
en cas de complications.
Et il y en a eu des tas.
La plupart des foetus
n'arrivaient pas à terme.
Ceux qui y arrivaient...
- mouraient avant...
- L'accouchement ?
Façon de parler.
Les mères porteuses
qui survivaient jusque-là...
Disparaissaient.
Sans laisser de trace.
C'est de ça que parlait ma mère,
dans son mémo.
Elle craignait ce qui arriverait
à Donoterase.
Que faire ?
Décidez-vous vite.
Ils transfèrent le petit à l'aube.
Où ?
Une base du Triumvirat
en Afrique.
Votre mère pensait
avant tout aux enfants.
Que ferait-elle ?
Ce qu'elle essayait de faire
quand on l'a tuée.
Sauver les enfants.
Je suis là.
Excusez-moi.
Je ne vous ai pas entendue.
Je peux faire
quelque chose pour vous ?
Je suis juste venue parler.
Vous ne voulez rien ?
Seulement te voir.
Tu vas bien ?
Oui, très bien.
Je suis prêt à travailler.
Tu pleurais.
Non, je ne pleurais pas...
Ne le dites pas à M. Raines.
Il se fâche si je montre
mes émotions. Je ne le ferai plus.
C'est normal de pleurer.
Non.
Pas pour moi.
Je suis là pour servir,
pour obéir.
Raines t'a dit ça ?
Mon intelligence
est destinée à aider les autres.
M. Raines dit que les émotions
sont gênantes.
Si vous ne voulez pas me faire
travailler, que voulez-vous ?
A ton âge, je connaissais
un garçon comme toi.
Exactement comme toi.
Je l'aimais bien,
mais je ne le montrais pas.
Je voyais
de la souffrance
dans ses yeux,
mais je détournais le regard.
Je vois la même souffrance
dans tes yeux.
Mais je ne peux plus
détourner le regard.
Je ne comprends pas.
Tu veux rester ici, ou faire
ce que font les autres enfants ?
Que font-ils ?
Ils jouent, ils s'amusent.
Ils découvrent la vie.
C'est une simulation ?
Non. C'est la réalité.
Je fais ce que je veux.
J'aide les autres.
Alors, pourquoi pleurais-tu ?
Je ne pleurais pas...
Ca va.
Si M. Raines l'apprend,
il se fâchera.
Et quand il se fâche, il...
Je ne le laisserai plus
te faire de mal.
On va te sortir de là.
Il n'ira nulle part.
Je n'arrive pas à le croire.
Vous partez avec eux ?
Pourquoi ?
Vous aussi, Broots ?
Vous m'avez bien eue,
à courir le globe tel un Dr Spock
bénévole quand vous n'êtes
qu'un docteur Mengele.
Vous dites n'importe quoi.
C'est votre cobaye original.
Qu'allez-vous lui dire ?
Ils vont transférer le petit.
Quand ?
Je ne peux plus t'aider.
Sidney, je vous en prie !
Inutile de consulter
l'unité centrale.
<i>Il n'y a plus de refuge</i>
<i>pour toi.</i>
Il a raccroché.
Il est avec eux.
Qu'a-t-il dit ?
Qu'il était inutile
de consulter l'unité centrale.
Pourquoi nous dire
où ne pas regarder ?
Il n'était pas seul. C'est sa façon
de nous dire où regarder.
Il a dit qu'il n'y avait plus...
de refuge.
J'avais raison
de compter sur vous, Sidney.
Vers la piste d'atterrissage.
Direct.
L'avion nous rejoint
aux premières lueurs.
Je rêve !
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Allons-y, Junior.
On est attendus.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Jarod.
C'est Parker.
Fais-le monter.
Où vas-tu ?
Emmène-le !
Monte.
Dehors !
Qui êtes-vous ?
Je suis toi.
La négligence
mène au chaos.
Le chaos à l'anarchie.
L'anarchie à la ruine.
Nous sommes au Centre.
La ruine
n'est pas envisageable.
Matumbo...
Les excuses ne sont
que les échecs d'hier.
Seules
les solutions importent
à présent.
Nous voulons tous la même chose :
récupérer le petit et Jarod.
J'écoute.
Le gosse nous a échappé.
Mais on a le père de Jarod.
C'est notre atout.
- Jouons-le.
- Et je vous garantis
qu'après 10 mn avec le Major,
je saurai
où sont Jarod et le petit.
Brigitte s'occupera
du Major Charles.
Si je peux me permettre...
Vous honorerez mes souhaits.
Bonne réponse.
En attendant, il faut traquer
Jarod et le petit. M. Lyle
conduira cet effort.
A part Sidney,
je connais Jarod
mieux que quiconque
et il ne lâchera pas le petit.
Ce que vous oubliez,
c'est le petit lui-même.
On ne lui a pas appris
à coopérer.
Surtout avec Jarod.
C'est une perte de temps
et d'argent de poursuivre Jarod.
La clé de tout ça se trouve
dans l'Unité de Reconstitution.
Le plan de Matumbo est bon.
Il faut le suivre.
Alors, c'est réglé.
Deux points d'attaque.
Deux généraux.
Une stratégie.
Je découvre les joies
du linge sale.
- Pas ici, mon ange.
- Si, ici.
Tu as laissé Matumbo
me mettre à l'écart sans broncher.
Bon sang !
Il s'agit du Triumvirat.
Chacun de mes actes ou de mes mots
peut me condamner à mort.
Tu sais que je devrais
être avec le Major.
Et tu sais
que je dois parfois jouer selon
mes règles, même si ça te déplaît.
Jouer ?
Il s'agit de l'homme qui a tué
maman, il s'agit de notre famille.
Il s'agit de survie.
Ce que je fais, mes choix,
tu ne comprendras jamais ça.
Dis-moi, papa.
C'est Matumbo qui te fait peur,
ou ce que le Major Charles
risque de m'apprendre ?
Je pensais être
persona non grata.
Vous l'étiez.
Jusqu'à ce que Broots, notre ami
fouineur, confirme mes soupçons.
Vous avez laissé un e-mail à Jarod
dans une boîte appelée "Refuge".
Vous lui avez dit
comment trouver le petit.
Je vous avais pris pour un méchant.
Pardon d'avoir douté de vous.
Désolé de n'avoir rien pu
vous dire. Pas plus qu'à Broots.
Le clonage humain...
Je ne vous aurais pas cru.
Quand je suis allée parler
au petit, c'était...
C'était si étrange de lui parler.
Comme si j'avais
de nouveau 11 ans.
Pourtant...
Pourtant ?
Pourtant,
le petit est Jarod
sur tous les points
sauf l'essentiel.
Il n'a pas l'âme de Jarod.
Il n'a pas grandi avec vous.
Quand j'ai appris
qu'ils avaient reproduit Jarod,
il fallait que je m'en occupe
ou quelque chose serait perdu.
Si affronter le Major Charles
est si important pour vous,
allez-y.
Faites-le et que tout le monde
aille au diable.
Il doit y avoir des allumettes.
Un peu de lumière.
Tu as froid ?
Le bois doit être humide.
Je vais casser une chaise.
Je ne comprends pas.
Pourquoi as-tu peur de moi ?
<i>Cet homme est méchant ?</i>
<i>Très méchant.</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce qu'il a fait ?</i>
<i>C'est l'homme</i>
<i>qui a tué tes parents.</i>
Comment peut-on faire avaler
un tel mensonge à un enfant ?
Raines ferait avaler
du sucre à un diabétique.
<i>Il n'a pas l'air d'un tueur.</i>
<i>Il a l'air triste, M. Raines.</i>
<i>Comme si un vide dans sa vie</i>
<i>l'empêchait d'être heureux.</i>
<i>Peut-être a-t-il perdu un proche,</i>
<i>ou sa famille.</i>
<i>Il se sent peut-être</i>
<i>comme moi,</i>
<i>ne sachant pas qui il est</i>
<i>ni d'où il vient.</i>
<i>Tu n'es pas concentré.</i>
<i>Il n'est pas différent</i>
<i>des autres.</i>
<i>Je ne sais pas...</i>
<i>Je me sens relié à lui.</i>
Ce petit est bon.
Presque aussi bon
que l'original.
Qu'est-ce que je raconte ?
Il est l'original !
<i>Si tu ne le trouves pas,</i>
<i>il tuera les parents</i>
<i>d'autres petits garçons.</i>
<i>Comme il a tué les tiens.</i>
<i>Tu comprends ?</i>
<i>C'est bien.</i>
Je te jure
que je n'ai pas tué...
tes parents.
- Que sont-ils devenus ?
- C'est compliqué.
Tu es un garçon doué.
Tu es capable de comprendre
des concepts difficiles.
Quand j'étais petit,
je me regardais dans la glace
en pensant à mon passé.
J'imaginais mon avenir.
Il t'arrive de le faire ?
Oui.
Mais je ne vois aucun passé.
Quand j'étais petit,
on m'a enlevé à mes parents.
Le Centre m'a tenu prisonnier.
Ils ont exploité mon esprit,
m'ont fait faire des choses.
Que je n'aurais jamais dû faire.
Comme celles qu'ils te font faire.
Un jour, j'ai appris
qu'elles servaient à faire du mal.
Et même à tuer.
Alors, je me suis enfui.
Vous vous êtes échappé ?
Pas entièrement.
Ils ont gardé une partie de moi.
Une partie...
Une partie de mon ADN.
Ils avaient un plan,
pour me garder
prisonnier à jamais.
Je ne comprends pas.
Je crois que si.
Si tu pouvais voir ton avenir
dans une glace,
il serait exactement comme...
moi.
Mais mes parents...
Ils n'existent pas.
Ils n'ont jamais existé.
Du moins,
pas comme on te l'a dit.
Vous mentez.
Vous êtes intelligent.
Vous mentez !
J'aimerais bien.
Mais je ne mens pas.
Je suis désolé.
J'ai une chose à te montrer.
C'est moi
à ton âge.
<i>- Je n'y arrive pas !</i>
<i>- Fais-le ou vous mourrez tous</i>
Je suis vous ?
Je viens de nulle part ?
Tu viens d'ici.
Et je viens de deux êtres
qui m'aimaient beaucoup.
C'est normal de pleurer.
Je ne peux pas.
M. Raines me l'interdit.
<i>- Ne la laissez pas approcher.</i>
<i>- Maman !</i>
Battez-moi tant que vous voulez.
Plutôt mourir
que trahir mon fils.
Vous allez mourir,
mais pas pour votre fils.
Pour ma mère.
Vous lui ressemblez.
Vous devez le savoir.
Vous l'avez tuée.
C'est mon revolver.
Celui avec lequel
vous l'avez tuée.
C'est celui qu'un certain Raines
m'a volé le jour de sa mort.
Elle savait qu'elle risquait
des ennuis.
Pourquoi le croirais-je ?
Parce que c'est vrai.
Je devais l'aider à libérer Jarod
et deux autres enfants.
Raines m'a tiré dessus,
m'a laissé pour mort
et a pris mon arme.
J'ai toujours la balle
dans le dos.
Vous avez gagné une seconde.
Parlez vite.
Votre mère m'a trouvé.
Elle savait que je cherchais Jarod.
Elle avait peur
du Triumvirat.
Elle disait
qu'il fallait agir vite.
Que le Triumvirat
menaçait son mari
car elle défendait les enfants
et s'opposait au Projet Gémeaux.
Ils menaçaient papa ?
Ils menaçaient
sa femme et sa fille.
Vous étiez l'autre enfant
que nous voulions libérer.
Elle devait vous emmener
en Europe le lendemain.
Vous avez oublié ?
Mon père était au courant
de ces sauvetages ? Du mien ?
C'est ce que j'avais compris.
Je n'en suis pas sûr.
Mais je suis sûr d'une chose :
votre mère craignait
pour votre père et pour vous.
Elle craignait le pouvoir
que le Triumvirat avait sur lui.
Raines en était alors
le chien de garde.
Il aboie toujours.
Maintenant, je comprends
pourquoi il m'a volé mon arme.
Vos parents et moi,
nous voulions la même chose :
aimer nos enfants
et les avoir près de nous.
Petit déjeuner.
Ce n'est pas du blé
et du jus de tomate.
C'est ce qu'eux te donnaient.
C'est de la glace. Jamais
tu n'oublieras la 1re bouchée.
Vas-y, goûte.
Vas-y.
C'est très bon.
Il y a tant de choses
à découvrir.
Aussi bonnes que ça ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire ?
Il faut faire sortir mon...
notre père du Centre.
Echangeons-le
contre un équivalent.
Comment ai-je pu douter de lui ?
Toutes ces années.
Je me demandais pourquoi papa
me cachait des choses.
C'était pour mon bien.
Nous voulons tous croire
à la bienveillance de nos parents.
Je trouve enfin la sérénité
et vous voulez la saboter ?
Si vous êtes si heureuse,
pourquoi chargez-vous cette arme ?
C'est simple :
Raines mort,
moi heureuse.
Il n'est pas facile à tuer.
Pour vous qui tirez comme un pied.
Moi, je ne le raterai pas.
Mlle Parker.
Venez tous les deux.
- Venez vite.
- Plus tard.
Non, croyez-moi.
Vous n'en reviendrez pas.
Il est ici.
Place !
Vous vous souvenez de moi ?
Où l'avez-vous trouvé ?
On l'a pas trouvé.
Il s'est livré.
Après 3 ans de cavale, c'est
le mal du pays qui te ramène ?
En fait, je viens négocier.
- Appelez mon père.
- Il n'est pas là.
A quoi tu joues ?
C'est très simple.
Tu reverras ton père
quand je reverrai le mien.
Vous offrez un échange équitable :
votre père contre mon mari ?
Je ne dirai pas équitable,
mais passons. Oui.
Et si c'est du bluff ?
Voir, c'est croire.
J'appelle dans 2 h
pour organiser l'échange.
L'un de vous amènera mon père.
Un seul.
Ce sera moi.
Ce sera Sidney.
Il s'agit de mon père.
De notre père.
Raison de plus
pour garder la tête froide.
Sidney est le seul
qui ne trichera pas.
- Où aura lieu l'échange ?
- Comme je l'ai dit,
j'appellerai.
Et ne vous avisez pas
d'être en avance
et de tout compliquer.
Je dois y aller.
Tu veux revoir ton père ?
Vivant ?
Vous avez laissé filer Jarod ?
Il tient mon père.
Et nous le tenions !
J'ai pris la décision
qui s'imposait, enfoiré !
La dernière, Mlle Parker.
La hiérarchie du Centre
est claire.
En l'absence de M. Parker,
M. Raines prend les commandes.
Et quel est votre plan ?
On envoie 2 équipes de nettoyeurs.
Une fois le lieu connu,
l'une couvre le terrain,
l'autre exécute.
Vous jouez avec la vie
de mon père.
On suit les instructions
de Jarod.
Raines ne connaît Jarod
qu'administrativement.
Je sais comment ce type...
Nous ne sommes pas
en démocratie !
Ma décision prévaut.
- Jarod.
<i>- Route nationale 40.</i>
Iversonville, Caroline du Nord.
A 15 heures.
<i>- Pas 14h59, ni 15h01.</i>
<i>- 15 heures.</i>
<i>- Sidney a à peine le temps de...</i>
- Qu'il se dépêche.
Jarod, je veux parler
à mon père.
<i>Papa, tu es là ?</i>
Sidney, allez-y.
Allez chercher le Major Charles.
On y va.
Comme je l'ai dit :
deux équipes.
Et je veux
votre meilleur tireur d'élite.
Je suis votre homme.
Jarod ne s'en tirera pas.
Je veux Jarod vivant.
Le petit aussi.
C'est M. Parker
qui a cessé d'être utile.
Cette ordure de Raines
va faire tuer mon père.
Je doute que Jarod
fasse du mal à votre père.
Il a cherché son père toute sa vie.
Il fera le nécessaire.
Je le lis dans ses yeux.
- Vous voulez faire quoi ?
- Pareil : le nécessaire.
Jarod n'est plus
le seul ennemi.
Soyez tranquille,
je ne vous oublie pas.
Je sais ce que
vous pensez de moi.
Mais croyez-moi :
nous sommes du même côté.
M. Raines
projette de tuer votre père.
Pourquoi vous croirais-je ?
Parce que sinon, quelqu'un
que nous aimons mourra.
Avec ou sans vous, j'y vais.
Unissons nos forces.
Je vous en prie.
Je vous remercie.
De quoi ?
D'avoir élevé mon fils.
Il est devenu
le reflet de vous.
Comment était-il enfant ?
Quelqu'un qu'un père
serait fier d'appeler son fils.
Je suis désolé
que vous n'ayez pas pu.
En fait, je crois
qu'il n'y a pas pire
que ce que vous avez souffert.
Si. J'aurais pu
ne jamais le retrouver.
<i>Sidney ?</i>
<i>A 400 m, il y a une route.</i>
<i>Tournez à droite.</i>
<i>Mon père vous indiquera</i>
<i>le chemin.</i>
<i>Je vais suivre ses instructions.</i>
Il a juste dit
que son père connaissait la route.
On est en pleine cambrousse,
sans Sidney
et sans savoir où il va.
Je sais exactement où il va.
Où donc ?
Au commencement
de cette petite odyssée.
Je vous le concède.
Capturer le roi était inspiré.
Entrer au Centre pour négocier...
- Très courageux.
- Je ne suis pas courageux.
Je suis prudent.
C'est une nécessité.
Afficher sa volonté.
Vous autres ne comprenez
qu'une chose : le pouvoir.
En tout cas, c'était brillant.
Pas étonnant
qu'on ait du mal à vous attraper.
C'est pour ça qu'on vous veut.
Vous êtes brillant.
Je ne reviendrai pas.
Lui non plus.
- Mais j'ai une question.
- Je vous en prie.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi vous faites ça ?
Pourquoi le Centre ?
On fait des concessions,
pour une cause qui nous dépasse.
Je ne vous demande pas
de comprendre.
Mais en définitive,
tout se tient.
Vous volez des enfants.
Vous en créez.
Comment ça se tient ?
Viol, inceste, meurtre, survie.
Bien motivé, l'homme
est capable de presque tout.
Il est l'heure.
Papa.
Veille sur ton père.
Et sur toi.
Merci, Sidney.
Viens, papa.
Jarod,
je suis heureux pour toi.
Sidney devait venir seul !
J'étais obligée.
Ils veulent tuer mon père.
Qui ?
Papa, rentre !
Je l'ai.
Tirez !
- Non !
- Elle saigne beaucoup.
Comprimez la plaie.
Oubliez Parker.
Arrêtez l'avion.
Allons-y !
Pars devant.
Il a besoin d'un père.
Je te rejoindrai.
Je t'aime !
Moi aussi, papa.
Elle doit aller à l'hôpital.
Vous n'irez nulle part.
La chance tourne.
On fait ça gentiment,
ou vous voulez finir comme elle ?
Arrêtez-le !
Bienvenue au Centre, Jarod.
Reste avec moi, mon ange !

NICE FELLOW
<i>Vu dans Le Caméléon :</i>
Vous ne comprenez qu'une chose :
le pouvoir.
Papa, attention !
Tirez !
Bon retour au Centre, Jarod.
Du calme
ou je recommence à cogner !
ll pue encore.
En allant à la douche,
il a paniqué.
J'ai eu du mal.
ll a fallu un coup
de ''motivateur'' pour le calmer.
Si tu ne veux pas
aller à la douche,
je ferai venir la douche à toi.
Assez !
On ne cherche pas à le tuer,
simplement
à le désodoriser.
Lave-toi.
Ensuite, nettoie les murs.
Fais-le toi-même.
Le monde change.
M. Parker n'est plus là,
M. Raines n'est plus là.
Mlle Parker est...
Dieu seul sait où.
Mais toi et moi, on est là.
Et c'est moi qui commande.
Je l'ai dit, le monde change.
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens</i>
<i>sont morts à cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon,</i>
<i>un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>ll défend les opprimés.</i>
La vie est un don.
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
Aujourd'hui, oui.
C'était il y a 3 semaines.
Depuis, on travaille
à le rendre plus... maniable.
Pourquoi
je ne peux pas le voir ?
Regardez-le.
ll était incontrôlable.
Etait ?
Le monde change.
Et le petit prodige aussi.
Ecoutez-moi, Lyle.
Vous êtes détraqué.
Je suis persuasif.
<i>Je voudrais que tu remplisses</i>
<i>une mission pour moi.</i>
<i>Tout ce que vous voudrez...</i>
<i>M. L</i>y<i>le.</i>
La lobotomie est impossible
avec Jarod.
On a tous un talon d'Achille.
Chez Jarod, c'est la famille.
Celle qu'il rêve de retrouver.
S<i>i tu veuX des nouvelles de papa</i>
<i>et maman, fais-moi confiance.</i>
- J'adore ce passage.
- Je vous en prie,
je veux le voir.
Si ça ne tenait qu'à moi, vous
pourriez pique-niquer ensemble.
Mais les ordres
viennent du Triumvirat,
du grand Matumbo.
J'ai fait le plus vite possible.
Excusez-moi, Sydney.
On n'a pas fini
de parler de Jarod.
Jarod n'est plus
le centre du monde.
Demain, il part pour toujours.
ll appartient à Matumbo.
Je refuse de contrarier ce Zoulou.
Vous avez vu son regard
quand il a emmené
Raines et mon père ?
Louez un film,
faites-vous masser,
allez voir
les nains amputés
au niveau souterrain 6.
Oubliez Jarod.
Vous avez volé un disque ?
Depuis que Matumbo a mis
ce malade aux commandes,
il y a plus de victimes
qu'au massacre de la St Valentin.
ll a dit où Mlle Parker
était hospitalisée ?
Non, là aussi,
il a joué l'innocent.
Qui est l'albinos ?
Quelqu'un de plus important
que Jarod.
Qui peut être
plus important que Jarod ?
Je ne sais pas.
Peut-être que le monde
change vraiment.
Je cherche ma fille.
Au bout du couloir.
Mon ange !
Merci, Seigneur.
Mon ange, pardonne-moi.
Ce n'est pas ta faute.
Tout est ma faute.
- ça va ?
- On me drogue
depuis trois semaines.
Tu es le premier
à me rendre visite.
Oui, je sais.
C'est une bonne chose, non ?
Ces salauds ignorent où je suis.
ça ne doit pas changer.
Où étais-tu ?
- En Afrique équatoriale.
- Le Triumvirat doit être
- content du retour de Jarod.
- On s'y attendrait.
Au lieu de cela,
ils ont organisé une sale soirée
pour ce tubard de Raines et moi.
Je commence à douter
de sa loyauté.
Tu commences ?
La balle
que j'ai reçue dans le dos
t'était destinée.
On ne peut pas tuer un Parker.
J'ai déjà fait sortir Brigitte.
ll faut garder ce bébé.
ll faut garder le bébé en vie.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe, papa ?
Comme d'habitude. Jarod.
C'est la clé de notre survie
à tous. Je ne peux pas parler.
Pas ici, pas maintenant.
Tu me fais peur.
ll ne faut pas,
c'est ce qu'ils veulent.
Elle n'a pas droit aux visites !
- Je partais.
- Moi aussi.
Je signe mon bon de sortie.
Seul un psychiatre
peut le faire.
Un psychiatre ?
On m'a tiré dessus !
Depuis quand
les psys
utilisent des scalpels ?
Elle va appeler quelqu'un.
Ne dis à personne
que je suis venu ici.
Ne me laisse pas, papa.
Je reviendrai
quand je pourrai parler.
Comment s'appelait cet auteur
à la barbe blanche ?
Ta mère lisait
sans cesse ses oeuvres,
avec plein de ponctuation.
Shaw ?
Peu importe.
N'oublie pas cette citation.
''Une famille est une tyrannie
''renversée
''par le plus faible
de ses membres.''
Le plus faible de ses membres.
Souviens-t'en.
Quel est le programme ?
Un autre rendez-vous
- avec les câbles de M. Lyle ?
- Un nouveau jeu.
Un voyage de plus ?
Cette fois, c'est moins sûr.
Des vaccins.
Hépatite A, malaria, typhoïde.
- L'Afrique.
- Vous êtes aussi malin
- qu'on le dit.
- Pour ce que ça me sert !
Angelo, dis-moi où est Jarod.
Trouve-le pour moi.
Que se passe-t-il ?
J'utilise les dons d'Angelo
pour essayer de localiser Jarod.
Pourquoi un salon de coiffure ?
Pour éviter tout soupçon,
le labo doit
rester comme d'habitude.
Comme d'habitude !
Sydney... peur.
Oui, Angelo. Sydney a peur
de ne plus jamais revoir Jarod.
Mets-toi dans sa peau.
- Dis-moi où il est.
- Du nouveau ?
Pas encore.
Et vous ?
Certaines miettes peuvent
nous mener à Mlle Parker.
Un appel toujours
à la même heure
en provenance d'un hôpital
à 80 km.
- Des nouvelles de la patiente ?
- Exact.
Avant que j'aie pu localiser
la destination des appels,
l'albinos de Lyle a débarqué
pour une communication urgente.
Un truc du nom de... Silence.
Angelo content.
Trouver Jarod.
S<i>i tu veuX des nouvelles de papa</i>
<i>et maman, fais-moi confiance.</i>
- Sydney !
- ça va ?
C'est vrai qu'ils ont capturé
mon père et le gamin ?
C'est Lyle qui te l'a dit ?
ll a dit
qu'un des deux avait survécu
et que je saurais lequel
en Afrique. Si je coopère.
Tu crois Lyle ?
Pas vous ?
Pas vous, Sydney ?
Vous avez retrouvé l'aiguille
dans notre botte de foin.
Je me demande comment !
Je ne t'ai jamais aimé.
Je ne sais même pas
ce que tu es.
C'est l'heure, Jarod.
Pas d'injections, cette fois-ci.
Des sédatifs.
Je préfère dormir jusqu'à ce que
ça soit fini, Sydney.
Non, Jarod !
Je ne laisserai pas faire ça.
ça va être douloureux, Sydney,
mais vous serez séparés.
Alors, serrez-lui la main.
Dites-lui adieu.
Au revoir, Sydney.
Langue ?
C'est bien !
Sydney ? Emmenez-le.
L'âme de Jarod est obscurcie.
Mais il garde l'esprit clair.
Bonne nuit, cher prince.
- On peut partir.
- La Tour a appelé.
On doit déposer un passager.
Un projet de niveau A, Silence.
Avant d'avoir traversé
l'Atlantique, pas question
- de s'arrêter pour quiconque.
- Ordre de M. Lyle.
Je vous dirai
où on va après le décollage.
Oui, M. Lyle. J'ai les plans
et tout ce qu'il faut.
Dites aux clients de Raylor
que dès que notre homme
aura l'heure d'arrivée,
le projet Silence
réussira cette fois-ci.
Le promoteur catalytique
fera tout brûler.
Même si quelqu'un fouillait
dans les débris,
nos clients peuvent être sûrs
qu'il n'y aura aucune trace,
ne serait-ce que du détonateur.
Je vous assure qu'il n'y aura
aucune trace de la famille Nash.
Ou des autres occupants
du bâtiment.
Toute retombée résiduelle
aidera à masquer
l'identité de notre cible.
Je vous contacterai
en arrivant.
Vous n'avez pas détruit
assez de vies ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
Une balle dans le fuselage
peut faire exploser le jet.
Pas si quelque chose
colmate le trou.
Bonjour, cher prince.
Heureusement,
j'ai réussi
à faire atterrir l'avion.
Quelle chance !
Où est M. White ?
ll a disparu.
Vous savez où il est ?
Même si je le savais,
je me tairais.
Oui, Matumbo, je comprends
parfaitement ce que vous dites.
L'ironie de l'évasion de Jarod
ne m'échappe pas non plus.
Si je plaisante ?
Bien sûr que non, monsieur.
Je comprends qu'il faut retrouver
Jarod au sujet de Silence.
Mais comme vous le savez,
on a quelqu'un sur place.
Nos amis de Raylor
peuvent donc être sûrs
que le projet aboutira.
Je vous en donne ma parole.
On dirait
que le monde n'a guère changé.
Vous aviez raison, j'avais tort.
Mais je préfère avoir tort
et être en vie.
Si on ne récupère pas Jarod,
je ne serai pas le seul
à être rééduqué par Matumbo.
Pardon de vous interrompre.
Quoi ?
Vous ne devinerez jamais
qui j'ai vu dans le couloir !
Le bruit courait
qu'il était mort, mais il est...
vivant.
Ravi de vous décevoir.
C'est bon d'être de retour
au Centre !
Dieu vous bénisse tous !
Partons à la poursuite de Jarod.
Diplômé en physique nucléaire
de l'institut de technologie,
doctorat sur la structure
radioisotopique. lmpressionnant !
On regarde ce que ça donne
sur lnternet et on imprime !
Jeanie,
voici Jarod Hickum, concepteur
de la sonde Cassini pour la NASA.
Enchanté.
Les réacteurs
n'étaient pas russes ?
Vous devez penser à Topaz 2.
Les réacteurs de Cassini
ont été conçus à Chandon.
J'espère que vous pourrez
nous aider pour Neptune.
On a trois mois de retard.
On a perdu
nos deux meilleurs chercheurs.
Je suis là
pour faire mon possible.
On vous a cherchée partout !
Dieu merci, vous êtes...
Vivante ?
A peine. Et ces abrutis
refusent de me laisser sortir.
Dès que j'aurai retrouvé
mes forces, ça va barder !
C'est ce qu'ils craignent.
Selon le dossier, vous êtes ici
pour tentative de suicide.
On m'a tiré dans le dos !
Seul un parent
peut autoriser votre sortie.
Un parent !
Des nouvelles de votre père ?
- Non.
- En tout cas,
quelqu'un veut vous laisser ici.
Ce squelette ambulant de Raines !
Je n'en suis pas sûr.
Raines était peut-être
dans le camp de Matumbo.
Mais il semble
avoir trouvé la foi.
Je n'y crois pas.
ll se passe quelque chose
au Centre.
Lyle dit sans cesse :
''Le monde change.''
Raines est ressuscité,
Jarod s'est évadé
et Lyle a convoqué un albinos
pour un projet
du nom de Silence.
ll faut que je sorte !
Vous avez besoin de repos.
Encore 24 h au moins.
24 h... et j'envoie balader
tout ça !
Renseignez-vous sur l'albinos
et sur Silence.
Je suis touchée,
mais pas encore coulée. Allez !
- Que faites-vous ici ?
- Jeanie !
Je voulais me mettre au courant,
je suis venu à la source.
Sur quelle partie du projet
les Nash travaillaient ?
Le système de propulsion
pour Raylor.
lls ont fait des découvertes
aux applications multiples.
Leur travail est sous scellés
depuis l'accident.
L'accident ?
Leur voilier a explosé
dans un port des Caraïbes.
Une fuite de gaz,
quelque chose comme ça.
J'ai du mal à les croire morts.
lls ne le sont peut-être pas.
Qui a mis les scellés ?
ll paraît que tout est
au ministère de l'Energie.
<i>On dit que le silence est d'or.</i>
- Surtout au Centre.
<i>- ll eXiste un projet</i>
du nom de Silence.
Dieu sait lequel !
C'est M. Broots que j'entends ?
Comment le savez-vous ?
Septum dévié.
<i>Narine droite.</i>
J'ai pris un coup de Télécran
quand j'avais 7 ans...
Que savez-vous de Silence ?
Lyle et un drôle d'albinos
en ont parlé.
<i>L'homme auX cheveuX blancs !</i>
<i>On a pris l'avion ensemble.</i>
Je ne peux pas vous en parler.
On est censés vous attraper.
Je sais où vous habitez,
M. Broots.
Même si on en savait plus
sur Silence,
<i>vous n'imaginez pas</i>
<i>la situation ici.</i>
lls ont transformé M. Raines
en évangéliste.
Le Centre veut tuer un homme,
sa femme et leur fille.
<i>L</i>y<i>le et l'albinos</i>
<i>ont quelqu'un sur place</i>
<i>pour les aider,</i>
<i>sûrement</i>
<i>au ministère de l'Energie.</i>
Je dois savoir qui c'est.
On fera de notre mieux.
Vous avez intérêt.
Parce que sinon,
une famille innocente va mourir.
Qui est ce nouveau crack
sur l'affaire Nash ?
ll s'appelle Jarod Watts,
mais n'a rien d'un crack.
Etudes ratées.
Q.l. très moyen.
Ce type passe
d'un poste médiocre à un autre.
Mais son C.V.
a quelque chose d'unique.
- Quoi ?
- Son nom de famille.
Le même que celui
du sous-secrétaire.
- Fils ?
- Neveu.
Excusez-moi, je suis en retard.
Désolé... Jarod Watts.
Je suis en retard
parce que je potassais
le truc Nash.
Ce ''truc''
est un transfert
de protection de témoin.
Ne l'oubliez pas.
L'agent Timson
s'occupera de la protection
de Clare Nash
jusqu'à ce qu'elle retrouve
son mari et sa fille.
Je maintiens le code 3
sur l'affaire.
Excusez-moi, mais le code 3,
ça n'est pas un peu faible ?
Justement, Watts.
Le code 3 assure la protection
du témoin
sans trop attirer l'attention
sur l'endroit où il se trouve.
C'est assez efficace.
Bien, monsieur. Code 3.
Agent Carlson,
mettez Watts au courant
du ''truc Nash''.
Je ne tolérerai aucune erreur.
Déjeuner !
<i>Mon ange, c'est papa.</i>
<i>Je t'ai cherchée à l'hôpital,</i>
<i>mais tu es partie.</i>
<i>On ne peut pas retenir un Par</i>k<i>er.</i>
<i>Je dois te parler</i>
<i>face à face.</i>
<i>Je serai chez toi ce soir,</i>
<i>à 21 h.</i> S<i>ois seule.</i>
<i>Efface ce message pour éviter</i>
<i>la venue des indésirables.</i>
Les indésirables ! Raines !
Les recherches des Nash
pour Raylor
devaient se limiter
à des applications de propulsion.
Mais ils pensaient que Raylor
les utilisait pour l'armement
et ont prévenu
le ministère de l'Energie.
C'est alors
qu'on a essayé de les tuer.
- ll y a des pistes ?
- Aucune. Du travail de pro.
ça a été presque aussi bien
que de les tuer.
L'explosion les a séparés
et ils se sont cachés.
Jusqu'à ce qu'on découvre Jason
et sa fille dans les Caraïbes.
lls sont sous protection.
Jason Nash ne témoignera
que s'il retrouve sa femme.
On vient de trouver Clare.
Demain à 1 5 h,
ils seront réunis
au labo de recherches.
Si la famille est réunie,
la famille parle.
Si la famille parle,
la famille meurt.
Mon travail ici
est toute ma vie.
J'oeuvre pour le Seigneur
depuis des années.
ll est temps que vous payiez
pour le meurtre de ma mère.
Dites vos prières, enfoiré !
Mlle Parker, je vous présente
le père Connelley.
C'était un ami de votre mère.
Poursuivez votre oeuvre
charitable, M. Raines.
Qu'est-ce que c'est,
votre oeuvre charitable ?
Des exorcismes gratuits
pour expériences ratées ?
Vous croyez aux miracles ?
Je crois à la vengeance.
Dites-moi pourquoi
vous avez essayé
de tuer mon père.
Un acte égoïste et malencontreux.
Mais qui venait d'en haut,
Dieu m'en est témoin.
Vos bondieuseries
marchent peut-être à la paroisse,
mais pas avec moi.
Alors, je tendrai l'autre joue.
Mlle Parker...
les miracles dont je parlais...
commencent par...
l'amour.
Quand je vous aurai percé à jour,
il faudra
bien plus qu'une prière
pour sauver
votre misérable peau !
Merci, mais je n'ai pas faim.
Mme Nash refuse de manger ?
Elle panique un peu.
Laissez-moi essayer.
Ce n'est pas un menu de gourmet,
mais vous devriez essayer.
ça vous donnera des forces.
- Merci quand même.
- Je comprends.
Quand j'étais petit,
là où j'ai grandi,
je ne voulais jamais manger.
Pourquoi, agent Watts ?
Parce ce n'était pas mon corps
qui avait faim.
C'était mon coeur.
Aucun repas
n'était assez satisfaisant
pour m'aider à oublier
la famille qui me manquait.
Où est votre famille maintenant ?
Je ne sais pas.
C'est de ne pas savoir
et d'attendre
qui est le plus dur. En attendant,
ça peut vous aider.
Courtney m'a offert ça
pour la Fête des Mères.
Je pensais l'avoir perdu.
Demain, vous les retrouverez.
Je vous le promets.
Je regrette l'époque où ceux
dont je devais me méfier...
étaient ceux
dont je devais me méfier.
Vous avez vu
le nouveau M. Raines.
Voici M. White.
ll est sous les ordres de Lyle.
Mon frère a un sous-fifre ?
Le Triumvirat
lui a donné une équipe
il y a quelques années.
Son dernier projet
s'appelle Silence.
ll s'agit d'un couple
de chercheurs scientifiques.
Jarod était dans l'avion
avec White.
ll sait que ces innocents
mouront s'il n'intervient pas.
Vous savez qu'il essaiera.
Pas question de lâcher Jarod.
Mlle Parker voudra se tuer
quand elle saura ça.
Quelqu'un a une corde ?
- Votre nez siffle ?
- Septum dévié.
M. Parker ne peut pas
être le parent
qui vous a fait hospitaliser
pour tentative de suicide.
Les dates ne concordent pas.
Matumbo avait déjà écarté
M. Parker.
Le parent en question
est donc...
Lyle.
Lyle m'a enfermée là-bas.
<i>Désolé de ne pas être là</i>
<i>pour te parler face à face,</i>
<i>mais les projets ont changé.</i>
<i>Après tout, on est</i>
<i>au Centre, pas vrai ?</i>
<i>Je n'ai pas beaucoup de temps,</i>
<i>alors écoute-moi bien.</i>
<i>Le monde change.</i>
<i>Le Centre change. Je change.</i>
<i>Et toi, tu dois affronter</i>
<i>toute cette folie.</i>
<i>Affronte-la.</i>
<i>N'essaie pas de nous trouver.</i>
<i>Et surtout, mon ange,</i>
<i>fais attention à toi.</i>
<i>N'oublie pas.</i>
<i>''Une famille est une t</i>y<i>rannie... ''</i>
''...Renversée par le plus faible
de ses membres.''
Je m'inquiétais pour toi !
Tu craignais
que ta soeur suicidaire
ne joue au rasoir russe ?
Cette histoire de suicide
devait te protéger.
Pas idéal, mais c'est tout
ce que j'ai trouvé.
Les autres
te croyaient hors circuit.
Ceux qui ont eu Raines
et ont fait peur à notre père.
Ce qui te permet
de prendre le relais.
Matumbo claque des doigts,
j'accours.
Avec ton équipe.
Je sais tout
de ta mission secrète.
M. White. Silence.
Tant mieux,
j'ai besoin de ton aide.
Ecoute, je te parle franchement.
Silence est un contrat
de niveau A.
Hélas, Jarod s'est évadé
et en a fait sa cause.
Attention, tu transpires.
Avec Jarod en liberté,
ça se comprend !
Echoue et tu auras besoin
de mes prières, pas de mon aide.
J'ai besoin de ma soeur.
J'ai toujours été un battant.
Mais depuis que j'ai trouvé
mon père et toi,
j'ai compris que je n'étais plus
seul contre le monde.
ll paraît que le monde change.
Les yeux de papa le confirment.
Malgré tout,
le Centre a toujours été
une affaire de Parker.
Que tu le veuilles ou non,
on en est.
Battons-nous pour ça.
Pour nous.
Pour lui.
<i>MatériauX dangereuX</i>
<i>Vous avez un message !</i>
Timson...
- Où est Clare ?
- Elle est partie.
Elle va retrouver
son mari et sa fille.
- Vous n'étiez pas au courant ?
- Non.
Le rendez-vous
a été avancé à midi.
- Timson !
- C'étaient ses ordres.
ll a refusé
de me donner des détails.
Content que tu aies décidé
de te battre.
Je ne viens pas pour t'aider,
mais pour capturer Jarod.
<i>Agent Blaine ?</i>
<i>On est en place.</i>
Bien reçu.
L'équipe B
- a M. Nash et sa fille.
- Parfait.
C'est un honneur.
Les assassins
n'ont pas d'honneur.
Non...
de vous rencontrer.
Bon sang, vous êtes Jarod !
On n'a pas pu se parler
dans l'avion.
D'ailleurs,
je vous dois un sacré vol.
J'ai cru que j'étais cuit.
Où est la bombe ?
Si vous l'ignoriez,
vous ne seriez pas ici.
Cela dit, je m'en vais.
Si je meurs, je ne suis pas payé.
Vous n'irez nulle part.
C'était bien
de revoir votre père ?
Vous m'avez devancé de peu.
ll est à nouveau
dans la nature.
ça me donne du travail.
Du travail ?
Je trouve les gens.
Les disparus, c'est mon créneau.
Et votre famille,
c'est un boulot à plein temps.
Où voulez-vous en venir ?
Disons qu'occasionnellement
M. Lyle
me paie
pour des missions spéciales.
Votre soeur, Emily,
par exemple.
Que savez-vous de ma soeur ?
Elle adore les tulipes jaunes,
déteste la cruauté
envers les animaux.
Elle est drôle.
Elle est rongée
par la tragédie de sa famille
et a un adorable petit tatouage
juste au-dessus du...
Sa dernière adresse connue
est ici.
ll y a peut-être même
des potins sur maman !
Quel dommage
de voir tout ça s'envoler !
Vous pouvez peut-être
sauver la famille Nash.
Et peut-être même
cette famille-là.
Mais je ne suis pas compris
dans le prix.
A une prochaine fois.
Mieux vaut nous séparer.
Prends l'intérieur,
je couvre l'extérieur.
D'accord.
Je peux voir
mon mari et ma fille ?
Bientôt.
Très bientôt.
Excusez-moi.
Timson à l'appareil.
Certainement, monsieur.
Si je ne reviens pas
dans 5 minutes,
faites venir Nash et la petite.
Ce ne sera pas long.
Vous voilà !
Que faites-vous ?
J'ai vu l'inspecteur Wocheck.
ll pense que la tête
de Mme Nash est mise à prix
et que le tueur
appartient au ministère.
Blaine,
Jarod et vous, restez là.
J'appelle l'inspecteur.
- C'est inutile.
- Je dois y aller.
L'inspecteur m'appellera
sur ce portable
à midi pile.
Dans quelques minutes à peine.
Je dois vérifier
la position des agents.
Prenez mon talkie-walkie.
Je vous ai rien demandé, Blaine !
Excusez-moi.
- Quelque chose ne va pas ?
- Non.
Vous semblez pressé de partir.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Rien, c'est seulement...
fermé à clé.
- Ouvrez !
- Rien ne presse !
Ouvrez la porte ! Tout de suite !
Je ne comprends pas.
Quel est le problème ?
Si vous n'ouvrez pas,
on saute tous, abruti !
Vous voulez dire...
que ce que j'ai trouvé
est une bombe ?
Faites quelque chose !
C'est intéressant.
Vous saviez qu'il y avait
une bombe et vous ne disiez rien.
Vous alliez laisser mourir
une famille
et vos hommes
dans une explosion.
Et tout ça, pour quoi ?
Agent Blaine ? Emmenez-le.
Avec grand plaisir, Jarod.
Je crois que vous voulez voir
des êtres chers.
ll y a une berline marron
au parking.
Voilà de quoi commencer
une nouvelle vie.
Vous serez en sécurité.
C'est promis.
- Mais qui êtes-vous ?
- ça va.
On peut lui faire confiance.
J'espère qu'un jour
votre famille et vous
connaîtrez ce moment.
Bonne chance.
On n'a plus rien à faire ici.
ll s'est enfui ? Comment ?
Ne sous-estime pas Jarod.
Et ne me sous-estime jamais.
Si tu m'envoies encore
dans un bâtiment prêt à exploser,
veille à ce qu'il saute.
Parce que sinon,
c'est ta matière grise
qu'on ramassera
à la petite cuillère.
Jarod t'a laissé quelque chose.
<i>A bientôt, J.</i>
<i>Mon ange,</i>
<i>désolé de t'avoir manquée.</i>
<i>J'avais besoin</i>
<i>d'entendre ta voiX.</i>
<i>Ne t'inquiète pas pour moi.</i>
<i>Brigitte et moi</i>
<i>sommes en sécurité.</i>
Enfin, je crois.
<i>C'est quand on croit l'être</i>
<i>qu'on est le plus vulnérable.</i>
<i>Ne fais pas</i>
<i>la même erreur que moi.</i>
<i>Ne montre pas ton point faible,</i>
<i>c'est ce qu'ils visent.</i>
<i>Non, attrape Jarod</i>
<i>et ne le laisse plus</i>
<i>jamais s'enfuir.</i>
<i>C'est la seule clé.</i>
<i>Depuis toujours.</i>
<i>Une dernière chose.</i>
<i>Je te sais solide,</i>
<i>je ne m'inquiète pas.</i>
S<i>ois prudente au Centre.</i>
<i>Personne</i>
<i>n'est ce qu'il paraît être.</i>
<i>ll n'</i>y <i>a pas un être</i>
<i>dans cet endroit</i>
<i>à qui tu puisses te fier.</i>
<i>A une eXception près peut-être :</i>
<i>ton frère.</i>
Vous êtes qui ?
Je m'appelle Jarod.
Vous avez vu cette femme ?
Je vous ai demandé
qui vous étiez.
Son frère.
Bon sang ! Elle sera navrée.
Elle est partie aujourd'hui.
Elle n'a pas dit où.
Elle croyait
qu'on la suivait.
Une fille charmante !
Elle était seule ?
Oui, mais elle cherchait
sa famille.
Elle était décidée à la trouver.
Je vous l'ai dit,
elle serait navrée de savoir
qu'elle vous a manqué.
Quoi ?
On a au moins réuni une famille.
Et la mienne
est à nouveau déchirée.
- Je sais ce que c'est.
<i>- L</i>y<i>le a peut-être raison.</i>
Peut-être que le monde change.
<i>Peu importe combien il change.</i>
Le monde reste le même pour nous.
On y est toujours seuls.

NlCE FELLOW
Jarod est parti
depuis deux jours.
Ce gars me manque.
ll est adorable.
Amen, mon pote !
Je l'avais pris sous mon aile.
Je veillais sur lui.
Toujours prêt
à aider les autres !
J'aime aider
les défavorisés.
Darwin Transport.
C'est ici !
Quoi ?
Jarod était là ?
ll s'enfermait
pour 3 ou 4 jours.
ll me payait
pour jeter un oeil,
lui apporter du pain, de l'eau.
L'enchaîner.
Chacun fait ce qu'il veut,
c'est ma devise, surtout
si ça rapporte du blé.
ll me demandait parfois
de le câbler
à une batterie de voiture.
A chacun son plaisir.
Jarod !
Je savais pas que t'étais là !
Je vous ai eus !
Offrez-vous
une bouteille de bonheur.
Même pas de quoi
me payer un verre.
Rien de tel qu'un chez-soi.
La limite est mince
entre génie et folie.
Jarod a gommé la limite
depuis longtemps.
Qu'est-ce qu'un foyer sans télé ?
L'écriture de Jarod.
On lui obéit ?
ll est logique dans sa folie.
S'il écrit ''ne pas toucher''...
ne touche pas.
C'est bloqué.
A bientôt, Mlle Parker.
M. Lyle !
Cet abruti n'était pas censé
savoir notre nom !
Un piège !
On est prisonniers de Jarod.
C'est la canicule
et il est enfermé depuis 3 jours.
ll va falloir une pelle.
Ce ne sera pas nécessaire.
Une douche suffira.
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>à cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>ll défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
Aujourd'hui, oui.
Bonjour, messieurs.
C'est un peu tordu
de passer 3 jours
là où Rion s'est pendu, non ?
ll faut se mettre
dans la peau des autres.
Appelez ça...
une simulation.
On vous apprend ça
à l'entraînement ?
ça vient de mon enfance,
lieutenant...
Molly Kimbrough.
Jarod Stevens.
Oui, je sais.
Le bruit court
que vous enquêtez
sur le suicide de Rion.
Le colonel Dance
m'envoie vous chercher.
ll est fumasse.
Furax.
En colère.
Je ne l'ai fait attendre
que 72 heures et 1 3 minutes.
Je suis flatté
d'avoir enfin votre visite.
Même si ça a pris
Le mot est faible.
Major de promotion.
Maîtrise de droit avec mention.
Et j'ai vu Rambo
27 fois.
Le capitaine Saunders
était là le soir
où Rion est mort.
ll faudra qu'on parle.
Certainement.
Votre dossier dit tout de vous,
sauf votre grade.
J'ignore
si je suis votre supérieur.
Non seulement l'armée
promeut les incompétents,
mais elle permet
à des gens comme moi
de superviser tout soldat,
quel que soit son grade.
Je vous appellerai ''colonel''
si vous y tenez.
Excusez-nous.
Volontiers.
Si je peux vous être utile...
Après vous.
Arrêtons ces conneries.
D'accord ?
Entendu.
L'entraînement de survie
brise systématiquement
l'identité d'un homme,
voire sa volonté de vivre.
A moi de voir qui peut réussir
cette épreuve ou pas.
Si un homme échoue ici,
il tombe tout seul.
Mais en temps de guerre,
il entraîne ses frères avec lui.
Tout ça est très noble.
Voici quel est mon devoir.
ll s'apparente à un serpent
dans l'herbe.
lci, on protège les nôtres.
Pas besoin d'un flic du Pentagone.
Rion en a peut-être besoin.
On a déjà enquêté sur sa mort.
ll était enfermé
et il a craqué.
ll s'est mutilé.
ll a craqué !
Vous risquez de perdre
votre temps
et surtout
de me faire perdre le mien.
Les parents de Rion ne croient pas
au suicide de leur fils.
lls n'acceptent pas cette idée.
C'est pas joli, mais c'est vrai.
La vérité est justement
ce que je veux découvrir.
J'étudie l'impact
des particularités physiques
sur le processus sensoriel.
Je m'en serais douté.
La facture d'expédition laissée
par Jarod est louche.
Comment ça ?
Trop évidente,
comme s'il voulait que
Mlle Parker et Lyle enquêtent.
Peut-être.
Quoi d'autre ?
Des livres
et du matériel militaires.
Une cassette de Rambo. Mais
je n'ai pas encore tout examiné.
ll faut prévenir
Mlle Parker et M. Lyle,
ça peut les aider
dans leur enquête.
Justement.
Personne ne sait où ils sont,
comme s'ils avaient disparu.
La communication ne passe pas.
Et merde !
Vise-moi à la tête !
C'est tentant.
Mais à quoi joue Jarod ?
Voyons...
ll nous enferme
pour Dieu sait combien de temps
avec un seau d'eau
et du papier toilette.
ll est clair
que ça n'est pas
qu'une question de survie.
C'est la loi du plus fort.
C'est pas un salaud,
on a des rations militaires.
<i>Bienvenue</i>
<i>dans votre nouveau fo</i>y<i>er.</i>
Oublie ce que j'ai dit.
C'est un salaud.
<i>Pendant toutes mes années</i>
<i>au Centre et mes 3 ans dehors,</i>
<i>la clé de mon eXistence</i>
<i>a été la survie, un jeu amusant.</i>
<i>Demandez-vous ce que vous feriez</i>
<i>pour survivre.</i>
<i>ll faut se connaître</i>
<i>et connaître sa famille.</i>
<i>Amusez-vous bien. Au fait,</i>
<i>je vous ai préparé</i>
<i>un bon repas.</i>
<i>J'espère que vous apprécierez.</i>
Sauterelles grillées.
C'est censé être riche
en protéines.
ça a un goût de réglisse.
Et toi ? Tu es prête
à faire quoi pour survivre ?
Une clé !
Futé !
Encore une pièce du puzzle
du petit génie.
Je me suis cassé une dent.
Et maintenant ?
Vous êtes là
depuis l'école d'officiers ?
Vous savez tout !
Je suis là pour fouiner.
Pourquoi n'êtes-vous pas encore
capitaine ?
Ce n'est pas ma compétence
qui est en cause,
mais la biologie.
C'est dur d'être une femme
dans l'armée !
Rion savait s'en souvenir.
- Vous le connaissiez bien ?
- On était amis.
ll me respectait,
contrairement à ces rustres.
ll était gentil, très gentil.
ll a appelé ses parents
la veille de l'entraînement ?
C'est à moi de fouiner.
Désolée. Mais le bruit court
qu'il aurait dit à son père
qu'il allait dénoncer quelqu'un
juste après
l'épreuve d'isolement.
ll n'a pas eu l'occasion
de le faire !
Je ne pense pas.
Le terrain d'entraînement est là,
mais Reed ne vous aidera guère.
ll fait chaud, Seeley, hein ?
Tu en veux ?
Tu veux une gorgée ?
Zut, j'arrête pas de faire ça.
- Tiens bon !
- Ne craque pas !
Abandonne, Seeley.
Abandonne.
Tu pourras boire.
On t'emmènera
dans une pièce climatisée,
tu prendras une bonne douche.
Et après, tu appelleras ta maman
pour qu'elle vienne te chercher !
Tu veux ?
Je continue.
- Accroche-toi !
- Ne craque pas !
Voilà le flic !
Passez dans mon bureau.
Vous étiez de garde
le soir où Rion est mort.
Oui et c'est moi qui l'ai découvert
pendu par sa ceinture.
Lisez le rapport.
Vous devez avoir une théorie
là-dessus.
ll était seul,
il a passé la nuit seul.
On était dehors
pendant tout ce temps.
ll a dû avoir peur du noir.
ll a perdu les pédales.
Au point de se mutiler ?
J'ai pas pu le lui demander.
Vous m'arrêtez ?
- Pas aujourd'hui.
- Tant mieux, j'ai du boulot.
Ces gars sont toujours en vie.
Je tiens à ce qu'ils le restent.
<i>L'officier Rion se suicide</i>
<i>Pas d'enterrement officiel</i>
<i>Les parents accusent l'armée</i>
<i>d'étouffer l'affaire</i>
<i>Chers papa et maman,</i>
<i>c'est presque fini.</i>
<i>ça signifie beaucoup pour moi.</i>
<i>J'ai toujours voulu entrer</i>
<i>dans cette unité, comme papa.</i>
<i>Nos discussions</i>
<i>sur son eXpérience au Viêt-Nam</i>
<i>m'ont préparé à l'entraînement.</i>
<i>Comme il dit, l'outil essentiel</i>
<i>de la survie, c'est l'esprit.</i>
<i>Vous me manquez beaucoup.</i>
<i>Je suis impatient de vous voir.</i>
<i>Votre fils,</i> S<i>cott.</i>
Je ne comprends pas.
Aucune nouvelle
de Mlle Parker ou M. Lyle.
Leurs portables ne répondent pas.
ça m'inquiète.
Moi aussi.
Leur disparition
est liée à Jarod ?
Les manuels militaires
qu'on a trouvés
parlent tous de survie ?
J'envoie une autre équipe
de nettoyeurs dans le Texas.
Etudiez de plus près
tout ce qu'on a retrouvé.
ça marche !
Que manigances-tu, Jarod ?
<i>Certains prisonniers de guerre</i>
<i>reviennent indemnes,</i>
<i>d'autres ne sont plus</i>
<i>que l'ombre d'euX-mêmes.</i>
<i>- lls semblent hantés.</i>
<i>- C'est vrai.</i>
<i>Observe ces hommes, Jarod.</i>
<i>Pourquoi certains survivent</i>
<i>et d'autres s'effondrent ?</i>
J'ai trouvé...
...Saunders
et le reste de l'unité de Rion.
Où ?
lls ont fini l'entraînement
de prisonnier de guerre
et vont faire une initiation.
lls peuvent être n'importe où
dans cette zone.
Je vais avoir besoin
de ma gourde.
Ne le prenez pas mal,
mais vous ne les trouverez pas.
Ce sont des experts.
lls partent
et disparaissent.
Le fer est prêt, capitaine.
Tu l'as mérité.
La bouteille.
Bois un coup.
- Prêt ?
- Oui, capitaine.
Tu as réussi !
Un barbecue ?
Vous nous avez retrouvés ?
J'ai suivi vos traces.
On n'en laisse pas.
ll y avait un renfoncement
dans le ruisseau,
une pierre renversée
et une empreinte de 43
avec le talon fendu.
Autant envoyer une balise !
A votre place,
je serais prudent.
A votre place,
je suivrais le règlement.
C'est traditionnel et volontaire.
- Pas vrai, Seeley ?
- Exact.
Des têtes brûlées.
On en trouve peu
en entraînement à la survie.
On vient d'horizons différents.
J'étais dans la médecine,
Rion dans la logistique.
Duvall le remplace.
Walker est expert en armement.
Mais on forme
un seul corps, une seule âme.
On est une équipe.
Vous connaissiez tous Rion.
Pour survivre,
il faut connaître ses amis
autant que ses ennemis.
Votre vie en dépend.
ça n'a guère profité à Rion !
ll avait ses problèmes.
- De quel ordre ?
- Personnel.
Je sentais qu'il déraillait.
J'ai même dû le couvrir
à l'entraînement.
Je voulais que Rion réussisse.
On voulait tous
que Rion réussisse.
J'aurais dû en parler au colonel
mais il l'aurait viré.
Si je l'avais fait,
il serait vivant.
Comme vous l'avez dit,
il faut connaître ses amis...
autant que ses ennemis.
On risque de se déshydrater.
Ma dent m'aura tuée avant.
En matière de survie,
Jarod ne sait rien de moi.
Dommage que tu ne fumes plus.
Laisse tomber, Daniel Boone.
<i>ll doit faire froid.</i>
<i>J'espère que ça va.</i>
<i>Vous savez ce qu'on dit</i>
<i>des pôles opposés.</i>
<i>ça peut vite chauffer.</i>
<i>Au fait,</i>
<i>il</i> y <i>a un tube d'Ambasol.</i>
<i>Le chercher vous réchauffera.</i>
Des allumettes pour faire du feu
me réchaufferaient.
Tais-toi et trouve l'Ambasol.
Les pôles opposés...
On va étouffer.
J'ai trouvé l'Ambasol.
Tu es contente ?
Tu me remercieras plus tard.
On risque d'étouffer.
ll me faut
du chatterton.
Parfait.
Je le donnerai à Jarod.
ll paraît que le chatterton
est indispensable
en situation de survie.
ll n'est pas aussi malin
qu'il le croit.
Peu de gens le sont.
Que faites-vous ?
Je regardais les dossiers
du colonel Dance.
A minuit passé ?
Le colonel lance
une politique de portes ouvertes.
Vous aimez déranger, hein ?
Montez, je vous dépose.
Descendez !
On se balade
sur le sentier du souvenir ?
- Vous m'avez fait peur.
- Vous n'êtes pas le seul.
Quelqu'un a essayé
de me faire sauter.
Quelqu'un qui s'y connaît
en explosifs.
Si ça avait été moi,
vous seriez en miettes.
Je vois.
Vous êtes insomniaque ?
Je faisais juste un tour.
A l'endroit où Rion est mort.
lntéressant.
Vous l'entendez toujours ?
Ses cris.
Sa souffrance.
J'étais là
quand c'est arrivé.
C'était sa dernière nuit
dans le trou.
ll a passé la nuit à hurler,
à crier le nom du capitaine
et plein de trucs bizarres.
C'était horrible à entendre.
Au lever du jour,
ça s'est arrêté.
J'ai cru qu'il était évanoui,
puis Reed a ouvert
et on l'a vu...
pendu au plafond.
ll s'était lacéré,
un vrai film d'horreur.
Je me demande
ce qui a pu
lui faire faire ça.
Pourquoi ne pas l'avoir sorti ?
On voulait tous.
On nous l'a interdit.
- Saunders.
- Et Reed.
lls disaient
qu'il serait viré de l'unité.
Alors, ils l'ont laissé mourir.
lls ignoraient qu'il se tuerait.
Comment le deviner ?
J'ai eu du mal
à effacer ces meurtres
de mon esprit.
Tu sembles y être arrivé.
J'ai rencontré Sue à la fac.
Elle participait
à un programme d'échange
avec sa soeur Cindy.
Un soir, je suis passé chez elles.
C'était ouvert,
je suis entré et...
je les ai trouvées.
Enfin, ce qu'il en restait.
Dans la chambre.
J'ai été soupçonné.
Puis la police
a trouvé du chatterton
dans la voiture
du copain de Cindy.
Celui qui avait été utilisé
sur les deux soeurs.
Quelqu'un a pu mettre
le chatterton chez un innocent.
Pour survivre.
Tu ne comprends pas ?
Dans ce piège
comme au Centre,
Jarod veut nous séparer.
Fais-moi confiance.
C'est impératif
pour notre survie.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Tu penses à tout, hein, Jarod ?
Que signifie la montre ?
La survie.
Les nettoyeurs du Texas ?
Bredouilles.
Mais un type a mis Mlle Parker
et Lyle dans le container
où a vécu Jarod.
Le container était toujours là ?
Non.
Tout ce qu'on sait,
c'est qu'il va vers l'est.
Avec Parker et Lyle.
Ce n'est pas tout.
Jarod avait fait du container
un camp d'entraînement
pour prisonnier de guerre.
- La survie...
- Exactement.
J'ai inspecté
le repaire de Jarod.
Rien que du matériel utilisé
par les unités de survie.
Jarod a dû aller
dans une de ces bases.
ll y est peut-être encore.
<i>J'ai évalué les données.</i>
<i>Tes conclusions ?</i>
<i>Le prisonnier qui a le plus</i>
<i>souffert ph</i>y<i>siquement</i>
<i>ou a été détenu le plus longtemps</i>
<i>n'est pas le plus traumatisé.</i>
<i>Quel est donc</i>
<i>le facteur décisif ?</i>
<i>L'esprit,</i> Sy<i>dne</i>y.
<i>La volonté de survivre.</i>
S<i>i on lui enlève l'espoir,</i>
<i>la capacité</i>
<i>à surmonter ses peurs,</i>
<i>le prisonnier lâche prise</i>
<i>et s'autodétruit.</i>
Je veux une explication !
J'ai vu ça dans un film.
- Vous vous trompez.
- J'espère.
ça vaudrait mieux.
Je voulais voir
le dossier de Rion.
Je ne peux pas
rester les bras croisés !
Je dois savoir
ce qui est arrivé à Scott.
Vous ne croyez pas au suicide ?
Je ne sais pas.
Mais la famille de Scott
a droit à la vérité.
Et je suis prête à tout
pour la découvrir.
Votre vie est en jeu.
On a fait sauter votre voiture.
Parlez-moi du capitaine Saunders.
Je vois comment il vous regarde.
Quand on était seuls,
il m'a touchée...
de façon déplacée.
ça dure depuis quand ?
Quelques mois.
ll a commencé par des allusions,
des suggestions.
Une femme soldat s'y habitude.
On apprend
à attendre que ça passe.
ça n'est pas passé.
Vous l'avez dit à Scott.
Je lui ai fait promettre
de garder le silence.
Et ensuite ?
Une semaine
avant la mort de Scott,
je suis allée dîner
avec des amis au mess.
Saunders, Rion et les autres
étaient là.
Saunders n'arrêtait pas
de me regarder,
au point
que c'en était effrayant.
Je me suis levée.
Je voulais rentrer chez moi.
Saunders m'en a empêchée.
Je me suis débattue.
Je lui criais de me lâcher.
Mais il continuait.
J'étais terrifiée.
ll m'entraînait dans sa voiture.
Soudain,
quelqu'un l'a écarté.
Scott Rion.
ll a dit à Saunders
qu'il le dénoncerait.
lls se sont disputés.
Saunders a dit
à Scott
qu'il oubliait une chose :
l'unité passe avant tout.
ll a dit
que ça n'était pas fini,
qu'il donnerait
une bonne leçon à Scott.
Quand Scott s'est suicidé,
j'ai culpabilisé.
Scott s'est bel et bien suicidé.
Mais pas par choix.
Quoi ?
ll ne présentait
aucun signe d'instabilité.
L'entraînement de prisonnier
est dur.
Mais Scott savait
qu'il ne restait qu'une nuit.
Pourquoi a-t-il craqué ?
J'ai trouvé quelque chose...
dans son cerveau.
On l'a drogué
pour le rendre fou ?
C'était ce qu'il voulait dire.
ll ne se mutilait pas,
il écrivait un mot.
Scott savait
qu'on l'avait drogué.
ll voulait nous dire
qui l'avait fait
et comment.
ça semble impossible.
Rion savait que Saunders
était mêlé à un projet
de drogue pour interroger
les prisonniers de guerre.
Le nom de ce projet était...
Abyss.
Scott savait
qu'on l'avait drogué.
Sentant qu'il devenait fou,
il a essayé de nous le dire.
Qu'allez-vous faire ?
Je vais prendre Saunders...
à son propre piège.
Tu peux boire maintenant.
Crois-moi.
Tic-tac...
Jarod voulait
que tu trouves la montre.
ll savait
qu'elle comptait pour toi.
Elle était à ma...
à notre mère.
Enfant, elle l'avait gagnée
dans une compétition de natation.
Papa me l'a donnée
pour mes 1 2 ans.
Je m'en servais
pour me chronométrer
quand je nageais sur place.
Tôt un matin,
j'ai pris la barque
et je suis partie seule.
Elle a commencé
à prendre l'eau,
puis elle a coulé.
J'ai essayé de nager,
mais j'étais trop loin.
J'ai fait du surplace
en espérant qu'on me retrouve.
J'avais des crampes
dans les jambes.
C'était terrifiant.
Dès que j'étais tentée
d'abandonner,
de céder à la douleur
et de me laisser couler...
j'entendais le tic-tac
de cette montre.
C'était comme si
maman me murmurait
de me battre pour vivre.
Pour survivre...
C'est ce que j'ai fait.
Bref...
papa a fini par venir
à ma rescousse,
mais c'est cette montre
qui m'a sauvé la vie.
Je l'avais perdue.
Quelqu'un l'a retrouvée.
Quoi encore ?
<i>Nouvelles instructions</i>
<i>L'entraînement à la survie</i>
<i>de 3 jours en solitaire</i>
<i>a été avancé et commencera</i>
<i>le 2 octobre 1 999.</i>
<i>Compote de pommes</i>
Syd, je l'ai trouvé.
J'ai trouvé le container.
Vous n'allez pas y croire.
Broots, adorable crétin !
C'est vous ?
Oui ! Je crois.
Ouvrez !
A vous de le faire.
Quoi ?
ll est écrit :
''Pour ouvrir,
tirez la manette Ne pas tirer
à l'intérieur.''
Je vous assure !
Jarod nous a renvoyés au Centre ?
lronique, non ?
Quelle bonne plaisanterie !
Quand je l'attraperai,
je le tuerai.
Vous avez une chance.
On l'a localisé.
Où ça ?
Dans le Texas. Tout près
du point de départ du container.
Bienvenue, mesdames !
Navré de vous bousculer,
mais la date de l'entraînement
a été avancée.
Vous serez dispersés.
Votre mission
consiste à vous évader.
Prenez le matériel nécessaire
sur la table.
Je veux être fier de vous !
Réveillez-vous, Saunders !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Scott Rion a dû se poser
la même question.
Qui est là ?
Rien que des démons
dans votre esprit.
Et des victimes
ressurgies du passé.
Qu'y a-t-il, Saunders ?
Vous êtes fou ?
Stevens ?
Vous semblez crever de peur !
ça vous coûtera
votre grade.
ça m'étonnerait
car je n'en ai pas.
En fait,
je ne m'appelle pas Stevens.
Je ne suis pas dans l'armée.
Qu'est-ce que vous m'avez fait ?
Ce que vous avez fait
à Scott Rion.
ll s'est pendu !
ll n'a pas tenu le coup !
A cause des hallucinogènes
dans sa ration.
Une drogue pour accroître
sa peur, sa terreur.
C'est de la folie !
Rion a dû penser la même chose
quand vous l'avez enfermé
ce soir-là.
La drogue a envahi son cerveau.
Soit il devenait fou,
soit il se tuait !
ll allait vous dénoncer
pour harcèlement sexuel.
Vous risquiez la cour martiale
et votre carrière.
Vous ne pouvez pas le prouver.
C'est pour ça que j'ai concocté
ma dose personnelle...
d'Abyss.
ça commence lentement,
puis ça devient
de plus en plus fort.
L'esprit
sombre dans la folie.
ça ne devrait pas tarder.
Vos yeux vous jouent des tours.
Votre peau aussi.
Votre cerveau lâche prise.
La clé de vos menottes.
Vous aurez les mains libres
au cas où vous voudriez
vous mutiler.
Je vous laisse.
Amusez-vous bien dans votre...
enfer.
Autre chose.
La ceinture de Rion.
Mais surtout,
ne faites pas pis que pendre.
Amusez-vous bien.
Attendez !
Ne me laissez pas ici !
Ne partez pas !
Laissez-moi sortir !
Vous avez raison !
D'accord, je le reconnais !
Je l'ai drogué !
Laissez-moi sortir !
On le laisse longtemps ?
L'effet se dissipera d'ici 2 h.
Ensuite,
il pleurera.
Laissez-moi sortir !
Le colonel dit que Saunders
aura ce qu'il mérite.
Entre 20 ans et la perpétuité.
Et la famille de Rion
recevra des excuses.
Du colonel en personne.
Merci.
Votre promotion
ne devrait pas tarder.
J'ignore votre grade, mais c'est
un honneur d'être sous vos ordres.
Merci.
Je vais mettre en application
mes talents d'évasion.
Bonne chance.
<i>A part ta molaire cassée,</i>
<i>tu as survécu.</i>
Pas grâce à toi.
Tu avais tout ce qu'il fallait.
ll suffisait d'ouvrir les yeux.
J'étais censée voir quoi,
au juste ?
Pour survivre,
il faut distinguer
ses amis de ses ennemis.
Tu insinues
que Lyle est mon ennemi
et que tu es mon ami ?
<i>Peut-être.</i>
Tu dois être prête à tout
pour survivre.
Parce que Lyle l'est sûrement.

Un cône vanille-müesli,
s'il vous plaît.
C'est fermé.
J'ai des sous.
ll est 7h30, bon sang !
Essayez le Waffle House.
Avec le fer et le calcium
de la glace,
les sucres lents du cône

Douce Surprise,
que dans un petit-déjeuner complet.
Z'ętes un peu toqué ?
Non, mais j'aime les glaces.
<i>Avez-vous vu ma fille ?</i>
La police a déjŕ vu sa chambre.
Votre nom, c'est quoi déjŕ ?
Waxman.
lnspecteur Jarod Waxman.
D'aprčs votre collčgue,
une adolescente disparue depuis
moins de 48h n'est pas prioritaire.
On a changé d'optique.
Rien de spécial
dans la vie de votre fille,
avant qu'elle disparaisse ?
Elle était soucieuse ?
Ma femme est morte il y a 3 ans.
Le cancer.
Je suis désolé.
J'en ai souffert, mais pas autant
que Jesse.
Elle venait d'avoir 1 5 ans.
A cet âge,
une fille a besoin de sa mčre.
Je n'avais pas les réponses
qu'elle cherchait.
Elle a pu partir avec une amie ?
Jesse est timide.
Elle n'a pas de vie sociale.
Je ne sais pas...
elle s'est volatilisée.
Elle semble s'intéresser
aux anges.
Depuis la mort de sa mčre,
elle les collectionne, elle lit...
C'est son préféré.
<i>Le Pouvoir des anges</i>
- Vous aviez vu ça ?
- Jamais.
Les Portes de l'enfer.
C'est l'écriture de Jesse.
Aidez-moi.
Sa vie est entre vos mains.
<i>On m'a enlevé ŕ ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjŕ</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>ŕ cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>ll défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous ętes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Un homme sans visage ?
ça me rappelle
un jeune homme
que j'ai embauché
pour retaper
un vieux musée de cire.
M. Kleinman,
je ne vous avais pas entendu.
Un cadeau
pour un ami ?
Plutôt une sorte de message.
Je vous apporte ŕ manger.
- Une glace, j'espčre.
- Mieux que ça.
Des huîtres d'Alcatraz.
On n'en trouve que dans la baie
de San Francisco.
Allez-y, mangez.
Régalez-vous.
C'est trčs bon !
ça devrait faire l'affaire.
Vous ętes un homme étrange, Jarod.
Moins que ceux ŕ qui j'envoie ça.
Vous ne voulez pas dormir lŕ-haut ?
Je suis souvent seul.
J'aime bien la compagnie.
Vous avez déjŕ vu ça ?
Mon Dieu !
Oů l'avez-vous trouvé ?
Un homme que je connais
cherche sa fille.
Vous l'avez vu ?
Oui, je l'ai vu.
Un rescapé de l'holocauste ?
Certains S.S.
portaient ces symboles
sur leur uniforme.
Des diables, des démons.
Cet homme s'inquičte
pour sa fille.
ll y a de quoi.
De quoi ętre mort d'inquiétude.
<i>Les Portes de l'enfer</i>
Ta mčre t'a pas appris
ŕ pas fixer les gens ?
Je l'ai ŕ peine connue.
Je te plais ?
Je suis perplexe.
Tout ça ne vous fait pas mal ?
C'est exprčs.
Vous aimez la douleur
auto-infligée ?
Tu me fais marcher ?
Je cherche quelqu'un.
Un jeune magicien.
Vas-y, accouche.
J'ai vu Hawk distribuer ces trucs.
ll officie dans l'arričre-salle.
Quand t'auras fini avec l'oiseau,
reviens.
Je t'en ferai voir, de la magie.
Avec joie.
La plupart des gens
ne comprennent rien au monde.
lls existent, sans vivre.
lls regardent, sans voir.
Ce sont des portes,
des fenętres sur l'esprit.
Avec un parfait échange
d'énergies, ces fenętres
peuvent s'ouvrir.
Franchissez-les.
Je vous regarde.
Je vois en vous.
Je vois une tristesse.
Un vide.
Pensez ŕ ce qu'on vous a pris.
lmaginez mentalement
la cause de votre douleur.
Ayez confiance.
Pensez ŕ l'objet de votre douleur.
Le voyez-vous ?
Je vous offre ceci.
De tout mon coeur.
Qui était Clare ?
Ma soeur jumelle.
Oů est-elle ?
Elle est morte dans un accident
de voiture ŕ 2 ans.
Comment le saviez-vous ?
C'est simple.
Votre coeur me l'a dit.
Parlez-nous du vol de l'ange.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Un ręve
que faisait le grand Houdini.
Ou un cauchemar, pour certains.
Houdini pensait
que le pouvoir des anges
lui permettrait
de s'envoler vers le ciel
comme un Dieu.
Mais hélas,
il n'en était pas un.
Et son ręve est mort avec lui.
Hawk dit que c'est possible.
C'est ŕ notre portée.
Retrouvons-nous ŕ minuit
pour une séance de lecture.
Les anges soient avec vous.
lls semblent trčs...
dévoués.
Je leur offre
ce qu'ils recherchent,
ce que le monde leur refuse.
La magie.
L'amour.
Je m'appelle Jarod.
On vous dit doué...
du pouvoir de toucher les gens.
Désirez-vous ce don ?
Je désire apprendre.
Avec le meilleur.
Pourquoi m'ouvrirais-je
ŕ un inconnu ?
Le parfait échange d'énergies.
Kessler vous dira oů.
Minuit.
Vous ne semblez pas
croire au pouvoir des anges.
A propos du vol de l'ange,
vous aviez l'air
mal ŕ l'aise.
Minuit.
Oů es-tu, ange déchu ?
Oů es-tu ?
Taisez-vous
si ce n'est pas une bonne nouvelle.
ça va vous déplaire.
C'est une mauvaise nouvelle.
Une trace de Jarod ?
ll a disparu dans le néant.
Comme votre vie privée ?
A qui le dites-vous ?
Etrange, non ?
- La fille ?
- Le cigare.
Lyle ne fume pas.
C'est un cadeau.
Jerry,
le borgne qui s'occupe
du transport,
m'a dit que Lyle attendait
un gros bonnet du Centre.
Jerry a donné un nom ?
Pas que je me souvienne.
Alors, ça n'a pas plus de valeur
que cette chemise.
Don Ho fait une braderie ?
- Don qui ?
- Le carton.
Que contient-il ?
Mlle Parker, c'est pour vous.
C'est original.
''Méfie-toi
des cadeaux d'inconnus.''
Sűrement Jarod.
Vous croyez ?
ll parle peut-ętre de Lyle.
Cigares et champagne ?
Peut-ętre.
Qu'est-ce que tu mijotes, Jarod ?
Bienvenue
ŕ la séance de minuit.
Commençons.
Levez-vous.
Trčs ordinaire.
Lisez la date.
1 994.
1 994.
ça a un sens, pour vous ?
Pourquoi ?
J'ai perdu ma mčre
cette année-lŕ.
Retournez la pičce.
<i>Je t'aime, ma puce.</i>
<i>Maman</i>
Elle m'appelait ''ma puce''.
Elle est avec vous.
Elle le sera toujours.
Merci.
Vous avez trouvé le chemin.
Je n'étais pas sűr.
Ce n'est pas par ici.
Sécurité intensive.
Pour protéger les secrets.
Hawk garde sa vie privée... privée.
Veuillez rejoindre les autres.
La lecture a commencé.
Une question ?
Si je dis non, vous partirez ?
Sűrement pas.
Vous connaissez ?
Oů avez-vous eu ça ?
Je garde ma vie privée... privée.
Ne ratez pas la séance.
Non, bien sűr.
Votre nom ?
Levez-vous, Scott.
Je ne mords pas.
Posez ça.
Vous ętes nouveau.
Vous ętes nerveux.
Un peu.
Et vous saignez.
En vous.
Vous avez été trahi,
blessé par quelqu'un
que vous aimiez.
De quoi vous parlez ?
Vous le savez.
Tout va bien.
Nous vous aimons.
Vous n'y croyiez pas, au début.
Vous vouliez hurler,
mais vous aviez peur.
Vous étiez perdu.
Ne faites pas ça.
Vous étiez si jeune,
si vulnérable...
C'était un cauchemar.
ll avait tant de rage.
Je ne peux pas.
En fermant les yeux, vous pensiez
qu'il arręterait, mais non.
ll était de plus en plus violent.
Vous aviez peur d'en parler.
Peur de dire son nom,
terrifié qu'on ne vous croie pas.
J'avais peur.
Vous étiez enfant.
ll était si fort, si terrifiant.
Je voulais qu'il arręte,
croyez-moi.
Je voulais dire son nom.
Je le sais.
Maintenant, vous pouvez le dire
au monde entier.
Je ne peux pas.
Dites-le.
Non.
Dites-le, Scott !
Faites cesser ce cauchemar.
Je ne peux pas !
ça ne fait rien.
Je le dirai pour vous.
C'était votre pčre
qui vous frappait.
Je ne voulais pas
que ça arrive.
Je sais, Scott.
Je sais.
N'ayez plus peur, ŕ présent.
Vous devriez essayer sur moi.
Pourquoi pas ?
Vous l'avez aidé ?
Chacun a des secrets,
des démons cachés en soi.
Parfois, si on ne les arręte pas,
ils vous mangent petit ŕ petit.
Et vous, Jarod ?
Quels démons cachez-vous ?
C'est tout.
M. Kessler ramassera vos offrandes.
Encore un pli de Jarod ?
Le troisičme.
Votre chouchou
m'énerve toutes les heures.
Jarod ne joue jamais
sans motivation substantielle.
Une tęte en latex.
C'est quoi, cette fois ?
On s'enfonce
dans la 4e dimension.
Vous parliez de motivation ?
De substance, Parker.
ll y a un autre mot.
''Je ne vois rien.''
Avec les oreilles, c'était :
''Je n'entends rien.''
Du nouveau
sur l'invité mystčre de Lyle ?
Aucun tuyau.
Au moins, on a M. Patate.
<i>Adeptes</i>
<i>Mine d'or</i>
<i>Clare : jumelle morte</i>
<i>Battu par son pčre</i>
Je te trouve enfin, Jessica.
<i>Mčre suicidée</i>
Tue cet enfoiré.
Votre appel m'a intrigué.
Du nouveau sur Jessica ?
J'y travaille encore.
Vous m'avez dit que votre femme
était morte d'une maladie.
C'est le cas.
Pas tout ŕ fait, si ?
Je veux retrouver votre fille,
mais le temps presse.
Vous devez me dire la vérité.
Sarah était...
vive, pleine de vie.
Elle est tombée malade.
Toute cette vie l'a peu ŕ peu
abandonnée.
Elle a essayé le traitement,
mais il était trop tard.
J'ignore pourquoi
elle est montée sur ce toit,
ŕ quoi elle pensait en sautant.
La police l'a retrouvée
le lendemain matin.
Elle serrait encore
son pendentif.
D'oů la passion de Jesse
pour les anges.
J'aurais dű vous dire la vérité.
Je ne pensais pas que...
Trouvez ma petite fille.
Je n'ai plus qu'elle.
''Je ne dis rien.''
Vous le reconnaissez ?
ll ressemble ŕ Gilligan.
Vous savez, Skipper,
le Professeur,
Mary Ann et Ginger.
Vous avez grandi
dans une caravane ?
Non, dans un préfabriqué.
Jarod veut nous occuper
ŕ chercher l'identité de M. X
pendant qu'il court.
Mais pourquoi tant d'effort ?
Et les mots ?
Des blagues idiotes.
Ou un avertissement.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
On dirait de l'eau.
ça sent la marée.
ça aussi.
Jarod sčme peut-ętre
des indices.
Faites-les analyser.
Qui es-tu, l'ami ?
''Histoire des anges déchus''.
Des anges...
déchus.
<i>Le vol de l'ange est possible.</i>
<i>A notre portée.</i>
<i>J'ignore pourquoi</i>
<i>elle est montée sur ce toit,</i>
<i>ŕ quoi elle pensait en sautant.</i>
Je vous croyais plus malin.
Vous pouviez pas partir
et nous laisser tranquilles ?
Pas plus que vous ne pouviez
écouter Hawk
parler du vol de l'ange.
C'est lui qui a fait ça ?
Qu'est-il arrivé ?
Jesse Bracken
n'était pas assez riche ?
Elle avait trouvé
les fichiers informatiques ?
Sur les riches paumés
que vous avez recrutés.
ça se passe comme ça ?
Vous les éblouissez avec la magie
et vous les dépouillez ?
J'ai dit ŕ Hawk
qu'on devait partir,
mais il ne s'agit pas d'argent,
pour lui.
Le vol de l'ange
était le dernier acte.
Je vous jure, parfois...
il croit vraiment qu'il va voler.
Et elle ?
Hawk s'est énervé,
il y a quelques jours.
Jesse nous a entendus parler
de la combine.
Je pensais qu'il lui parlerait,
pas qu'il la tuerait.
ll l'a pas tuée.
Elle vit encore.
Aidez-moi ŕ la sauver.
Si vous la laissez mourir,
aucune magie ne vous sauvera.
Donnez-moi cette arme.
Elle voulait seulement
qu'on l'aime,
qu'on veille sur elle.
Quelqu'un l'a fait.
Votre arme.
Non seulement Jarod
a joliment coiffé M. Patate,
mais j'ai découvert
que les cartes ont été tachées
par des huîtres.
Des huîtres ?
Jarod mange salement ?
ça venait d'une huître
particuličre
de la baie de San Francisco.
Jarod voulait
qu'on le trouve.
San Francisco, c'est grand.
J'ai repensé
ŕ la tęte qu'il nous a laissée.
J'ai analysé la cire.
Elle sert surtout
ŕ faire des répliques humaines.
- Un musée de cire.
- Dans le mille.
J'ai trouvé un musée de cire
désaffecté.
Et quand j'ai appelé,
j'ai entendu ça.
<i>Bonjour,</i> Sy<i>dne</i>y<i>, Broots</i>
<i>et comme toujours, Mlle Par</i>k<i>er.</i>
S<i>i vous écoutez ça,</i>
<i>vous avez dű trouver</i>
<i>mon adresse actuelle.</i>
<i>Navré</i>
<i>pour les odeurs de poisson,</i>
<i>mais le temps est précieuX,</i>
<i>en cavale.</i>
<i>Je ne vous retiens pas plus.</i>
<i>Vous avez un avion ŕ prendre.</i>
<i>Je vous demande 2 choses :</i>
<i>apportez la tęte de cire.</i>
<i>Elle vous éclairera.</i>
<i>Et n'oubliez pas</i>
<i>d'attacher vos ceintures.</i>
- Beau travail.
- Merci.
Ne nous congratulons pas
tout de suite.
Préparez le jet.
On part en Californie.
Cette chemise
me donne la nausée.
C'est vrai.
ll est parti, je vous dis.
Sam...
ll est armé ?
Qui vous emploie ?
Jarod vous a aidé
ŕ rénover le musée ?
Quel artiste !
Les anges l'envoient.
Je vois.
ll a refait les collections
hollywoodienne et présidentielle
et les grands criminels.
ll a męme ajouté
un nouvel élément.
Jarod l'appelle
le Centre de la honte.
Montrez-moi ça.
J'ignore ce que ça veut dire,
mais quelque chose me dit
que vous le saurez.
C'est nous !
lncroyablement ressemblant.
C'est de plus en plus bizarre.
C'est pas bon signe.
ça alors !
On vient d'assister
ŕ notre exécution.
Fichons le camp.
Bienvenue au vol de l'ange.
En vous regardant ce soir,
je suis plein d'énergie divine.
Croire en la possibilité
de l'impossible,
cette foi distingue
les maîtres des disciples,
les illuminés des aveugles,
les dieux...
des mortels.
Avec votre force d'esprit,
tout est possible.
Vous cherchez
votre corde de sűreté ?
Etonné de me voir ?
J'ai vu la chemise.
Kessler vous a tué.
Rčgle d'or du magicien :
ne jamais croire
ce que l'on voit.
Que se passe-t-il ?
ll semble que Hawk
n'est pas le magicien
qu'il prétend ętre.
Vous voulez leur dire ?
Ou je le fais ?
Allez au diable.
Vous d'abord.
C'est quoi ?
C'est vous
et vous...
Vous tous. Regardez.
Hawk avait un dossier
sur chacun de vous.
ll savait qui vous étiez,
qui vous ętes,
d'oů vous venez,
combien vous aviez
ŕ ''offrir''.
ll connaissait vos peurs.
ll vous connaissait
mieux que vous-męmes.
En échange de ses ''intuitions'',
vous lui donniez
tout et pourquoi pas ?
ll connaissait vos âmes.
Pourquoi ?
L'argent.
Mais vous n'étiez pas tous
si crédules.
Vous avez tué Jesse pour ça.
Elle a trouvé votre ordinateur,
découvert votre combine
et voilŕ.
Elle était gęnante.
Vous l'avez fait monter
et vous l'avez jetée du toit.
Prouvez-le.
Chiche !
Quand vous jetez
quelqu'un du toit,
faites le ménage derričre vous.
Vous vous croyez encore digne
de voler avec les anges ?
Ou est-ce la triste fin
d'un mauvais tour de magie ?
Qu'attendez-vous ?
La main de Dieu ?
Mon ultime don.
Enfoiré, vous l'avez tué !
Souvenez-vous.
Rčgle d'or du magicien :
ne jamais croire
ce que vous voyez.
ça m'ennuie de le dire,
mais Jarod me pose une colle.
ll y a quelque chose
qu'on ne voit pas.
y eux, nez, oreilles, bouche.
Tout est lŕ.
''Je ne vois rien, n'entends rien,
ne dis rien.''
ça ne me dit rien qui vaille.
Vous n'ętes pas partis.
Pour aller oů ?
Vous le savez peut-ętre,
le Triumvirat a décidé
d'ętre plus actif
dans la recherche de Jarod.
Afin de protéger l'intégrité
de ce projet, un nouvel élément
servira de sauvegarde,
ou de filet de sauvetage.
Dis-le : un nouveau concurrent.
Considérez-le comme l'homme
des Affaires intérieures.
M. Cox ?
Avec un 'X''.
J'espčre que nous ferons
plus ample connaissance.
Sans doute.
Je regrette,
mais nous avons un rendez-vous.
Voilŕ la réponse.
Qui nous pose une autre question :
qui est M. Cox ?
Jarod a répondu.
C'est le bourreau.
lnspecteur Waxman.
J'espérais vous revoir.
Avant de partir,
je suis passé
faire mes adieux.
Vous avez l'air en forme.
D'aprčs le médecin,
c'est un miracle.
Vous m'avez sauvé la vie.
Comment vous remercier ?
Vous voir sourire, ça me suffit.
ll paraît que le coupable
a avoué ses méfaits.
ll ne fera plus de mal.
C'est moins bien
que de sauver une vie,
mais je vous offre ceci.
Qu'il vous protčge, vous aussi.
Je le garderai toujours.
Au revoir.

NlCE FELLOW
J'ai proposé à Jarod de loger
avec l'équipe, mais il préférait
être près des animaux.
Attention où vous marchez.
ll en libérait certains.
Voyons s'il a laissé autre chose
que cette puanteur.
Regardez : Le Monde sauvage,
National Geographic.
Le type aux crocodiles.
''Cette bête est une beauté.
Je vais la chevaucher.''
Jarod se prétendait éthologiste ?
D'un zoo dans le nord...
Blue Cove, Delaware ?
Là où j'attendais
d'être informé de cette excursion.
- Lyle...
- Un oubli.
Vous alliez m'appeler.
J'allais dire...
Regarde où tu marches.
Jarod regardait la télé et jouait
avec ses amies les bêtes ?
Le plus souvent,
il observait les chimpanzés.
ll était fasciné.
Jarod connaît la captivité.
Les yeux qui épient.
ll étudiait les chimpanzés
car il s'en sentait proche.
ll aimait les voir faire ça.
ça ?
Oui, s'accoupler.
Bizarre.
Huile de massage mentholée,
plumes à chatouiller.
Slip mangeable.
Je pense que tout ça,
c'est pour...
Le sexe. Le mot est ''sexe''.
Notre singe est en chaleur.
Bonjour.
Vous êtes le Dr Kinsey ?
Bienvenue à la Clinique Arnett.
Merci.
lnfirmière...
- Plante ?
- Plantay.
Je vous ai installé.
Voici votre emploi du temps
du jour et de la semaine.
La liste des téléphones.
Ne connaissant pas vos goûts,
j'ai fait du thé et du café.
Merci, c'est super.
Au Centre Arnett de sexologie,
la satisfaction est notre devise.
Besoin d'autre chose ?
ll y a une chose
dont j'ai un besoin urgent.
Je suis désolée, docteur.
Monique m'a devancée.
Elle n'est pas infirmière ?
C'est votre patiente de 9h.
Souffre d'un besoin
compulsif
de déguisement sexuel.
On fait tous semblant, parfois.
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>à cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>ll défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
On l'a fait à la laverie.
Et en haut du Dodger Stadium.
On aime les endroits risqués.
On en a besoin.
On ne pensait pas
avoir un problème.
Jusque-là.
Les secours disent
qu'on a eu de la chance.
Sans le marchand de cacahuètes,
on se serait tués.
On est ensemble depuis 5 ans
et on est encore...
immaculés.
Après cinq ans.
Beaucoup de gens
préfèrent attendre.
A l'échelle
de l'univers,
Nous avons des vidéos
qui pourraient vous aider.
Merci beaucoup.
N'essayez pas tout en une nuit.
Dr Kinsey ?
C'est écrit sur ma porte.
Dr Covney.
Mes patients m'appellent Allen.
Enchanté, Allen.
Combien de sexologues,
pour changer une ampoule ?
ll y a une ampoule à changer ?
C'est une blague.
Comme les drôles,
mais différente.
Vous vous y ferez.
Le sexe est source de blagues.
Notre tâche est importante.
A propos, Dr Arnett,
mon groupe de 1 1 h attend.
Bienvenue à bord.
Vous avez une minute ?
Pourquoi ces poupées
ont toujours l'air étonné ?
Dites-le.
Faut avoir un permis.
Apparemment,
Jarod a besoin
d'une douche froide.
ll a un esprit curieux.
C'est normal qu'il s'en serve
pour explorer
sa sensualité.
Autrement dit :
il est en rut.
En rut !
Vous avez trouvé
des choses intéressantes ?
Tout ce qui vous branche, poupée.
Pour trouver Jarod ?
On cherche toujours.
Qui sait ?
- Je vous tiens au courant.
- Merci.
Encore oublié de m'appeler ?
Tu pourras faire joujou.
Les règles ont changé.
Suite à une mauvaise
communication,
j'ai décidé de superviser
la poursuite de Jarod.
Dorénavant,
vous m'informerez de chaque étape
de vos recherches.
Chaque étape !
Sinon, tu iras à la Tour
et on aura de gros ennuis.
''Rapporteur'',
ça fera bien sur ton C V.
Comme tu dis,
regarde où tu marches.
Rendre compte à M. Lyle...
ça veut dire quoi ?
Pour moi, rien.
Je ne réponds à personne,
alors mon petit frère...
lntéressant.
Un bon de commande,
sans adresse.
Juste un site web.
Coquin.com.
C'est là que Jarod c'est fourni.
Trouvez l'adresse.
Pas un mot.
M. Lyle a dit...
lmaginez votre pire cauchemar.
Lynx de Marietta University.
Vous devez les aimer, ces Lynx.
Vous pouvez parler d'obsession.
Vous n'êtes pas attaché
à votre université ?
L'endroit m'a marqué.
Merci d'avoir répondu si vite
pour remplacer le Dr Blass.
Je suis inquiet pour ses patients,
pour la transition.
lls lui faisaient confiance.
Je tâcherai
de maintenir cette confiance.
La tragédie de Melissa
touche tant de monde...
On a arrêté l'agresseur ?
La police recherche
un patient criminel, Luke Carlo.
Melissa le suivait
en liberté surveillée.
Et ?
Melissa avait tendance
à trop s'investir.
Carlo était un prédateur.
ll en a profité.
ll l'a appelée,
en prétextant une crise.
Elle a atterri dans un bouge
appelé ''Eros lnn''.
On la dit en piteux état.
Elle est l'ombre d'elle-même.
Si vous aviez pu rencontrer
la Melissa qu'on a connue...
Elle était merveilleuse.
<i>Une seXologue terrifiée</i>
<i>Patient criminel soupçonné</i>
<i>M. Trul</i>y <i>?</i>
<i>Pourquoi êtes-vous là ?</i>
<i>D'après le juge,</i>
<i>je suis un pervers.</i>
Tony ?
Dr Kinsey, le nouveau.
Vous savez tout
ce qui se passe ici ?
Je suis un vulgaire interne.
- Je fais ma maîtrise.
- Agression psycho-sexuelle,
comportement sexuel anormal.
Sympathique.
Je travaille
sur les prédateurs sexuels
et je regarde leurs séances.
Autant en faire bon usage.
C'est le Dr Arnett ?
Avec un exhibitionniste type.
<i>Chacun a ses peurs.</i>
<i>Aucune honte à cela.</i>
<i>Le tout, c'est de les reconnaître.</i>
<i>Je n'ai peur de rien.</i>
C'est très instructif.
<i>Quand j'étais petit, mon père</i>
<i>m'a emmené chasser le canard.</i>
<i>Je posais des leurres</i>
<i>quand la barque a chaviré.</i>
<i>Je suis resté bloqué dessous.</i>
<i>L'eau montait</i>
<i>jusqu'à mon cou...</i>
<i>J'étais terrifié.</i>
<i>J'ai failli me no</i>y<i>er.</i>
<i>Depuis, je suis h</i>y<i>drophobe.</i>
<i>Une douche, passe.</i>
<i>Mais un bain, une piscine...</i>
<i>la peur me submerge.</i>
<i>La peur est naturelle, saine.</i>
<i>Mais il faut la contrôler,</i>
<i>pas la laisser nous contrôler.</i>
Vous avez observé les séances
du Dr Blass avec Luke Carlo ?
Le type qui l'a agressée ?
ll y a des vidéos dans son bureau.
Redoutable.
Le genre de type remonté.
Malheureusement,
il s'est défoulé sur elle.
Croquis intéressant.
Je gribouille, c'est rien.
Rien de tel qu'un gribouillis
pour exprimer l'inconscient.
J'ai noté
une certaine ressemblance
avec Mlle Parker.
Elle est impressionnante,
à toujours assurer.
Elle ne montre jamais sa peur.
Mon Dieu !
Fantasmer sur une collègue
est parfaitement naturel.
Je serais étonné
que des sentiments sexuels
ne fassent pas surface.
Je fais quoi ?
Ne gardez pas ces émotions
en vous.
Sinon, elles vous contrôleront.
Je ne vais pas lui dire.
Lui dire quoi ?
Un béguin, Broots ?
Qui est-ce, cette fois ?
La fille au double menton ?
Oui, mais c'est deux...
plis et un menton.
Regardez.
L'adresse de Jarod.
Coquin.com.
Restez ici
et faites semblant de chercher.
Moins Lyle en sait,
mieux c'est.
On est censés tout lui dire.
Vous êtes censé en avoir.
Mlle Parker, je vais rester.
J'ai mille choses à faire, ici.
A nous deux, cow-boy.
Bonne chance.
<i>Je suis un peu perdue, docteur.</i>
<i>Je n'avais jamais vécu ça.</i>
<i>Gloria, ça va aller.</i>
<i>Promis, on va vous aider.</i>
Désolée. J'avais besoin
de revoir ces vidéos.
J'ai entendu votre voix.
Vous étiez une patiente
du Dr Blass ?
Elle m'a aidée
à résoudre un problème
avec mon fiancé.
Je voulais réécouter
ses conseils.
Elle est unique.
Excusez-moi.
<i>ça va aller.</i>
<i>Promis.</i>
On va vous aider.
<i>Qu'est-ce que je ferais</i>
<i>sans vous ?</i>
<i>Une seXologue terrifiée</i>
Posez-le dans la boîte.
Je ne suis pas livreur.
Je travaille à la clinique.
Je n'ai pas besoin d'aide.
J'espérais que vous m'aideriez.
Je reprends vos patients
à la clinique.
ll y en a une
qui me pose problème.
Une jeune femme désespérée,
au bord du gouffre.
Désolée, je ne pratique plus.
Mais vous n'êtes pas indifférente.
Pourquoi je vous croirais ?
Je m'appelle Jarod Kinsey.
Le Dr Arnett m'a embauché.
Je travaille avec le Dr Covney
et l'interne Tony.
C'est facile à savoir.
Vous avez raison, mais Gloria
a toujours des soucis
avec son fiancé Eddie.
Gloria.
Je serai bref.
Des coquillages.
Vous aimez la mer ?
Ma grand-mère y avait une maison.
Mon refuge.
La mer me la rappelle.
J'allais faire du thé.
Vous avez parlé
d'une nouvelle patiente.
Elle souffre d'angoisse aiguë
due à un traumatisme affectif.
Symptômes ?
lnsomnie, panique
et peur envahissante.
Au fond d'elle-même,
elle veut guérir,
mais la peur l'en empêche.
Certains jours,
elle n'ose même pas se lever.
Son coeur palpite.
Elle respire mal.
Elle perd le contrôle.
Le pire, c'est qu'elle
commence à croire
qu'en finir
serait la seule issue.
ll n'y a pas de patiente.
Je vous l'ai dit :
je ne veux pas d'aide.
Si vous parliez du soir
de l'agression ?
Je ne peux pas.
Essayez.
J'ai l'esprit embrouillé.
Essayez.
Je suis allée dans cet hôtel
où logeait un de mes patients.
Luke Carlo.
C'était ouvert.
Je suis entrée.
ll y a eu...
une main plaquée
sur ma bouche.
Un bandeau.
Des menottes.
Avec les empreintes
de Luke Carlo ?
Je pensais qu'il allait mieux.
Je croyais l'aider.
Vous devez partir.
Vous ne devriez pas
mélanger ça.
Je sais. Allez-vous-en.
Partez !
<i>Je fais de mal à personne.</i>
<i>J'aime regarder, d'accord ?</i>
<i>Non, pas d'accord.</i>
<i>Vous mart</i>y<i>risez ces femmes.</i>
<i>Vous devez apprendre</i>
<i>à maîtriser vos pulsions seXuelles.</i>
<i>Les maîtriser ?</i>
<i>Vous savez pas comment c'est,</i>
<i>dans mon quartier.</i>
<i>lci, le seXe n'est que secrets</i>
<i>et chuchotements.</i>
<i>Là-bas, il se vend dans la rue,</i>
<i>24 heures sur 24.</i>
<i>Pas étonnant qu'on l'appelle</i>
<i>le quartier chaud.</i>
Je cherche cet homme.
Je vois personne.
Personne vous voit.
Les meilleurs yeux
voient sans être vus.
Vous connaissez la rue.
On peut le dire.
C'est un gars du coin.
ll est passé y a une minute.
Je le vois sans arrêt.
Souvent au magasin
de spiritueux.
Le voilà, là !
Vous me voulez quoi ?
Vous parler du Dr Blass.
J'ai rien à voir là-dedans.
D'où votre flingue ?
C'était pas moi.
Je vous le dis !
C'était pas moi !
ça n'a rien de sordide.
C'est la maison
des Castors juniors.
Bizarre, pour ''Coquin.com''.
Derrière le chrome,
la banlieue est un bouge.
Je peux vous demander...
Sydney dit qu'il faut
exprimer ses sentiments,
pas contenir ses émotions.
ça concerne encore les mentons ?
Un peu...
Aucune femme qui se respecte
n'aime qu'un type se déballe.
Si elle vous plaît,
lancez-vous ou oubliez.
On vient faire des emplettes.
Je ne comprends pas.
Quelque chose d'exotique
pour doudou ?
Je ne vois pas.
Jarod nous a menti, chéri.
Vous êtes des amis de Jarod ?
Entrez !
Navré pour l'accueil.
On doit être discrets,
pour les voisins.
Ma femme, Linda.
Moi, c'est Roy.
Dieu bénisse lnternet.
ll y a quelques mois,
les gadgets sexuels
n'étaient qu'un passe-temps.
Je n'ai pas besoin
de vous le dire.
J'apprécierais.
Comment connaissez-vous Jarod ?
Par des forums
et sa commande maousse.
Ma femme l'a remarqué.
On lui envoie encore des trucs.
ll a déménagé.
Vous auriez son adresse ?
Oui, je crois.
1 248, Wren Park,
Wyattville.
1 248, Wren Park.
C'est ça.
Venez dans notre tanière.
On ouvre une bouteille
et on laisse parler la nature.
Je préfère ma nature
dans un parc naturel.
J'ai un nouveau pieu.
Un trois-places super rembourré.
Très confortable.
Nous quatre ?
Vous êtes échangistes ?
Très tentant, Roy.
Mais je ne partage pas
mon bel étalon.
C'est moi.
lls viennent de partir.
Vous avez vu Melissa ?
ça m'étonne
qu'elle vous ait ouvert.
- Comment va-t-elle ?
- Pas bien.
Elle est paranoïaque
et manifeste
des troubles obsessionnels.
Je sais qu'elle est traumatisée,
mais il y a autre chose.
ll y aurait d'autres problèmes ?
Peut-être.
J'allais vous poser la question.
Avant tout ça, Melissa était
la personne la plus stable.
Je n'ai pas envie de parler.
J'ai un paquet.
Une promenade sur la plage ?
Jarod, c'est de la folie.
On est des psys.
La folie,
c'est notre métier.
Je veux que vous fermiez les yeux.
Fermez les yeux.
lmaginez-vous
chez votre grand-mère.
Vous vous y sentiez
en sécurité.
Ecoutez le bruit des vagues.
Sentez le soleil
réchauffer votre visage.
ll ne peut rien vous arriver, ici.
<i>Alors, je suis entrée.</i>
<i>Une main plaquée</i>
<i>sur ma bouche.</i>
<i>Un bandeau... des menottes.</i>
Je sais ce que vous faites.
Je fais ces exercices
avec mes patients.
Vous savez que ça marche.
Nous devons parler
de la nuit de votre agression.
Je vous ai tout dit.
Je dois savoir
si vous avez vu Luke Carlo.
L'avez-vous vu ?
ll m'a attirée là-bas.
Mais l'avez-vous vu ?
Je ne sais plus...
Non, il faut croire que non.
Qui d'autre aurait fait ça ?
Pronil ?
Un léger sédatif.
Prescrit par le Dr Covney ?
ll s'occupe des ordonnances.
- Dr Covney.
- Un problème ?
ll y a souvent
des erreurs de prescription ?
Jamais. Pourquoi ?
On a prescrit ça
dans un flacon de Pronil.
Du Daronex ? C'est grave.
Très grave.
Le Pronil est un sédatif.
Le Daronex augmente l'anxiété.
A doses régulières,
ça pousse à bout.
Pourquoi l'avoir prescrit
à Melissa Blass ?
Je n'ai pas rédigé
cette ordonnance.
Votre nom est inscrit.
Sur toutes les étiquettes.
Le Dr Arnett a fait ça.
C'est lui qui traite Melissa.
Je ne peux pas croire
qu'il ait fait cette erreur.
Moi non plus.
On a suivi vos conseils.
Faire l'amour chez vous,
derrière des portes closes,
dans la chambre.
C'était bien.
Hélas, je n'ai pas pu résister...
J'ai ouvert les rideaux.
Là, c'était bon.
On a découvert
des tas de voisins charmants.
Dommage qu'on doive déménager.
Donnez-moi un ''S'' !
Donnez-moi un ''E'' !
Donnez-moi un 'X''...
Merci, Monique.
Rhabillez-vous, maintenant.
C'est l'adresse
que le couple nous a donnée.
Jarod a fait mieux.
C'est mieux qu'un lupanar.
Aidez-moi à monter.
J'en ai marre
d'être en retard.
On est peut-être à l'heure.
Regardez tout ça.
Le journal du jour.
A manger, des habits,
un lecteur de DSA.
ll est encore chaud.
Jarod vit encore ici.
On doit prévenir M. Lyle.
C'est trop important...
Désolé.
La peur me donne faim.
Une pistache ?
Quand a-t-on reçu cette adresse
de Jarod ?
Lyle venait de partir.
On met les bouts.
Attendez-moi !
<i>Pas de suspect pour le viol</i>
<i>Une étudiante violée</i>
<i>DeuX autres viols sur le campus</i>
<i>Le violeur frappe encore</i>
Quel changement !
Je me sens déjà
bien plus claire.
J'aurais dû me méfier
de ces cachets.
Comment ? lls sont identiques.
Et le Daronex
vous troublait l'esprit.
ll est temps de parler
sérieusement
de ce qui vous est arrivé.
Vous pouvez verrouiller
vos portes et vos fenêtres,
mais la peur restera en vous.
Je vous ai déjà tout dit.
Le reste n'est pas là.
Remontons plus loin,
à votre premier viol.
Vous savez ça ?
Appelez ça
une intuition de médecin.
J'étais à l'université.
Vous étiez à Marietta University
avec le Dr Arnett.
Je rentrais tard, un soir,
après les cours.
Je passais devant
les anciens dortoirs.
Un homme masqué
a surgi de la pénombre,
m'a attrapée et attirée dedans.
On ne l'a jamais arrêté.
Mais vous avez rebondi.
Oui, vraiment.
Je me suis fait aider,
j'ai travaillé dur
pour redevenir moi-même.
Mais dans un coin de ma tête,
une partie de moi est...
brisée.
Je ne sais pas si je rebondirai,
cette fois.
Plus de remontant.
ll faut comprendre
ce qui s'est vraiment passé.
Comment, Jarod ?
En interrogeant
quelqu'un qui sait.
<i>lmaginez un endroit tranquille.</i>
<i>Vous êtes en sûreté.</i>
<i>Que vo</i>y<i>ez-vous ?</i>
<i>Des arbres.</i>
<i>Plein d'herbe verte.</i>
<i>C'est un parc où je vais parfois,</i>
<i>pas loin d'ici.</i>
<i>ll</i> y <i>a un banc</i>
<i>où j'aime m'asseoir.</i>
<i>Je regarde les nuages.</i>
<i>Qu'entendez-vous ?</i>
<i>De la musique.</i>
<i>ll</i> y <i>a un t</i>y<i>pe</i>
<i>qui est toujours là.</i>
<i>Avec son violoncelle.</i>
<i>C'est très</i>
<i>reposant</i>
<i>d'être assis sur ce banc,</i>
<i>à écouter le violoncelle.</i>
C'est vrai, Luke.
C'est reposant.
Vous pouvez courir,
votre mauvaise conscience
vous poursuivra toujours.
Je vous l'ai dit,
je suis coupable de rien.
J'ai pas agressé le Dr Blass.
Je sais.
Mais on vous a obligé
à l'attirer à l'hôtel.
Pourquoi ?
Le Dr Arnett l'a agressée ?
Je voulais pas l'appeler.
J'aime bien le Dr Blass.
C'était la 1 re personne
à s'intéresser à moi.
Mais un soir,
après une séance,
Arnett m'a coincé.
ll m'offrait un marché.
Si je l'attirais à l'hôtel,
il me dénonçait pas.
Me dénoncer pour quoi ?
Une séance manquée,
violation de conditionnelle,
peu importe.
ll a dit que ce serait facile
de me renvoyer en taule.
ll fallait que je l'appelle.
Le lendemain...
quand j'ai su...
j'ai eu envie de vomir.
Le Dr Blass disait toujours :
''La guérison est une longue route,
''mais pas après pas,
''vous y arriverez.''
Je les faisais, ces pas.
J'allais mieux, grâce à elle.
Pourquoi n'avoir rien dit ?
Ma parole contre
celle du Dr Arnett ?
Un voyou comme moi
contre un médecin respecté ?
ll est intouchable.
Pas sûr.
On travaille tard ?
J'ai un cas qui m'inquiète.
Je peux vous aider ?
Peut-être.
Vous connaissez si bien
l'esprit des prédateurs sexuels.
J'ai du mal à comprendre
ses motivations.
Vous savez,
c'est le contrôle.
lls choisissent la voie du sexe,
mais leur motivation profonde,
c'est toujours le contrôle.
Pour l'avoir,
il anéantit sa victime,
il souille son humanité.
C'est son seul moyen
de prouver sa valeur.
Et s'il refuse le traitement ?
S'il n'admet pas sa responsabilité,
pas de progrès possible.
Je vais devoir trouver
une thérapie plus radicale.
Merci pour vos... lumières.
<i>Chacun a ses peurs.</i>
<i>Je suis h</i>y<i>drophobe.</i>
Vous voulez vous déguiser ?
Vraiment ?
Melissa ?
C'est toi ?
J'ignorais que tu sortais.
Une piqûre de B1 2.
C'est un sédatif.
C'est énervant,
quand on inverse
les ordonnances !
Du calme, docteur.
Vous êtes attaché.
Bienvenue à Eros lnn.
C'est vrai.
Vous êtes déjà venu.
Que faites-vous ?
Je vous aide à vous détendre.
Rien de tel
qu'un bon bain chaud.
Arrêtez !
C'est vrai : hydrophobie.
Vous devriez voir un spécialiste.
Vous êtes fou.
Je vous ai rien fait !
Mais à Melissa Blass, si.
Tout le monde sait
que c'était Luke Carlo.
Pas tout le monde.
Voyons si ma théorie
prend l'eau...
Vous avez pas le droit !
Question de ''contrôle''.
Comme à l'époque des Lynx
à l'université.
Vous avez ''contrôlé''
quatre innocentes.
Vous ne savez rien.
Pour les détails,
je nage un peu.
A propos de nager,
vous nagez sur le ventre,
sur le dos ?
Décidez-vous.
L'eau monte.
Je jure...
Vous êtes comme Melissa.
Sans défense.
Noyée dans sa peur.
- Pourquoi ?
- Pour ce que vous lui avez fait !
Jarod, arrêtez !
C'était sa faute !
Je l'avais anéantie,
il y a 1 2 ans.
Mais elle a refusé
d'être marquée à vie !
Elle me narguait !
Vous avez voulu
l'anéantir pour de bon.
En l'embauchant,
vous prépariez déjà
sa 2e agression.
Je devais lui donner
une leçon !
A vous d'apprendre la vôtre.
<i>Je devais lui donner</i>
<i>une leçon !</i>
Comme vous disiez,
chacun a ses peurs.
Je commençais à m'inquiéter.
Je ne savais rien
de la poursuite de Jarod.
Parce qu'il n'y avait pas
de poursuite de Jarod.
C'était un piège.
Le faux reçu,
le repaire bidon...
Mais le couple échangiste
était mignon.
En général,
tu es moins créatif
pour m'entuber.
Je ne vois pas du tout
de quoi tu parles.
La prochaine fois, révise.
Jarod est allergique
aux pistaches.
Elle est incroyable.
Allez lui dire.
Non. Les femmes ne veulent pas
qu'on leur dise,
mais qu'on leur montre.
C'est le moment de me lancer.
Je suis flattée.
C'est même très gentil.
Mais ça ne se fera pas.
Bonne chance
avec Double-menton.
Le soleil est si bon...
C'est un début.
Aujourd'hui, la terrasse.
Demain, le monde.
Melissa, beaucoup de gens
vous regrettent,
ont besoin de vous.
Les aider
sera ma meilleure thérapie.
Un pas après l'autre.
Merci.
Bonne chance.

Attendez ! Arrętez-vous !
Juste ici.
C'est lā.
Bravo, Broots.
Vous savez dire ''carte''.
On n'est pas perdus.
D'aprčs les indications de Jarod,
c'est par ici,
ā une vingtaine de mčtres...
par lā !
įa doit ętre įa... par ici.
C'est įa !
ll y a longtemps
que j'en ai assez
du petit jeu de Jarod, mais įa,
c'est du temps perdu.
ll nous a fait venir ici
pour une raison.
Pour nous faire tourner
en bourriques dans le Kansas.
Je crois qu'on n'est plus
dans le Kansas.
Pardon ?
On a dû passer la frontičre ici.
Qu'avez-vous dit, exactement ?
Je crois qu'on n'est plus
dans le Kansas.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Une brique.
Une brique jaune.
Avec une adresse.
Comme dans Le Magicien d'Oz.
Bravo, Broots.
J'adore cette histoire.
Mettez-vous au pas,
les Munchkins,
ou je vous assomme.
Allons voir ce que notre singe
mijote.
Vous appréciez le crottin,
finalement ?
Désolé pour le malentendu,
mais le nom
m'a fait croire
que c'était autre chose.
J'ai bien fait de pas suggérer
la sauce tartare.
- Vous avez des w.-c. ?
- Pour les clients.
Je prends un beignet.
Tout va bien ?
Oui, impec !
Je peux vous aider ?
Merci.
C'était juste un baiser.
- Je peux vous aider.
- En dégageant.
ll a l'air méchant.
Vous embrassez bien,
mais fermez la portičre.
Fermez-la !
Voilā, elle est fermée.
C'est pas
ce que j'avais en tęte.
La police vous recherche ?
Non, elle nous recherche.
įa fait quel effet ?
<i>On m'a enlevé ā ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjā</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>ā cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>ll défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous ętes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
ll fallait me dire
que vous étiez en cavale.
Je vous ai rien demandé.
Vous aviez besoin d'aide.
J'apprécie,
mais vous ętes pas mon genre.
Assureur, banquier ?
Agent de change.
Du moins, je l'étais.
Pčre de famille ?
Deux enfants, une femme.
Vous les emmenez au foot ?
Vous devriez vous rendre.
Du calme.
Je ne fuis pas les flics.
Je fuis un flic.
Singulier. Ce charmant monsieur
était Vince, mon ex.
ll prend mal la rupture.
Ce flic était amoureux de vous ?
Et alors ?
Je suis une affaire !
Oų allez-vous ?
Nulle part. N'importe oų.
Je vous déposerai quelque part.
Pas devant chez vous,
įa défriserait votre femme.
Je n'ai pas de femme.
Ni de ''chez moi''.
Vous allez oų ?
Nulle part.
N'importe oų.
Je suis déjā allé quelque part.
Je vais vers l'est,
alors, c'est parti.
Vous pouvez conduire.
Ce serait bien
de connaître votre nom.
Enchantée, Jarod.
Moi, c'est Zoey.
Vous ętes sûr que c'est ici ?
L'adresse correspond ā la brique.
C'est moi, ou Oz
a sérieusement changé ?
Nous cherchons... qui sait ?
Jarod nous envoie.
Vous devez ętre Dorothy.
Une minute.
Si c'est Dorothy,
on est qui, Zeke et Hickory ?
Vous ętes Toto, au mieux, Broots.
En bas.
Ne me dites pas.
Vous représentez...
Oui... Entrez avant
que je climatise le monde entier.
Le Magicien a pas payé
l'électricité.
Tenez.
Vous savez quoi faire.
Suivez, suivez...
De mieux en mieux.
Ouvrez la porte !
Pas sans les mots magiques.
On sortira quand Jarod
le décidera.
Si j'avais une cervelle...
Regardez įa.
Combien de fois
on a fait įa, enfants ?
Elles sont jeunes
pour travailler.
C'est un stand de citronnade.
Vous n'avez jamais fait įa
avec vos amis ?
Tous les gamins font įa.
Pas tous.
Citronnade.
Les affaires vont bien ?
Pas terrible.
La chance tourne.
Mon ami et moi
avons trčs soif.
Pas vrai, Jarod ?
On meurt de soif.
Combien ?
50 cents le verre.
On a plus soif que įa.
ll nous faut la carafe.
įa ira ?
Maman !
200 dollars ?
On faisait įa
avec ma soeur Katie.
Je ręvais de gagner
une fortune
et įa n'arrivait jamais.
Je voulais voir un ręve
se réaliser.
Vous avez eu
une enfance heureuse.
Oui, il y a un million d'années.
Santé.
Nous, on mettait du sucre dedans.
Elle est parfaite.
Vous me faites peur.
Vous venez ?
Chantez !
Je ne la connais pas.
ll y a des cassettes
dans la mallette.
Vous la connaissez pas ?
lntéressant.
Vous voulez m'en parler ?
Que dire ?
Je déteste payer par chčque.
Tout cet argent, le flic...
Je vous en ai parlé.
Vous avez braqué une banque ?
Allez vous faire voir.
Mon seul crime est d'ętre
restée avec ce nase.
- Le flic ?
- Exact.
Vince était du genre
autoritaire. Pendant 2 ans,
il m'a battue.
J'ai mis le temps,
mais je m'en suis sortie.
C'est mes économies.
Voilā ma belle petite histoire.
A 30 ans, ma vie tient
dans 2 valises,
27 000 $ en liquide
et une Ford 1 962.
Tout est bien qui finit bien.
Excusez-moi.
Vous savez ?
Peu importe.
C'était sympa,
mais je vous dépose
au prochain arręt de car.
Vous désirez ?
Quand passe le prochain car ?
Une seconde.
Je vais chercher les horaires.
21 ā Central.
<i>femme suspecte de Warrington.</i>
<i>Plaque de Penns</i>y<i>lvanie :</i>
<i>E-B-D-6-2-3-3.</i>
<i>Elle est recherchée</i>
<i>pour vol ā main armée.</i>
S<i>o</i>y<i>ez prudent.</i>
Vous avez de la chance,
ou la poisse.
Le prochain car vers l'ouest
ne passe qu'ā 1 9h45,
mais si vous allez vers l'est,
le car de 1 3h30 arrive juste.
Mignonne.
Je me demande bien
ce qu'elle a fait.
Moi aussi.
Je vous vends un billet ?
J'ai changé d'avis.
On vous fait marcher.
Je n'ai rien volé.
On a un avis de recherche
contre vous.
Si c'est une erreur,
vous la corrigerez
ā Warrington.
Je n'irai pas ā Warrington.
Vous ętes sourd ?
On va venir vous chercher.
Me voilā.
Jarod Malloy,
police de Warrington.
Vous avez ma suspecte.
L'agent Hudono
était censé passer la prendre.
Oui, Vince.
ll a bugné la voiture du chef
sur le parking.
ll va lui passer un savon.
Je le remplace.
Je veux rentrer.
Vous avez le procčs-verbal ?
ll est dans la voiture de Vince.
On en a besoin
pour la relâcher.
Soyez chic.
Ma fille fęte ses 1 0 ans.
Je ne veux pas rater įa.
Relâchez-la.
Je vous faxerai le PV.
Pour votre fille.
Je vous revaudrai įa.
Oų allez-vous ?
Je suis garé derričre.
C'est la chose
la plus incroyable...
Vince arrive. Montez.
Vous pouviez partir
avec ma voiture et mon fric.
Comment saviez-vous
que j'avais pas menti ?
Comment ?
Vous me l'avez dit.
Montez.
Vous ętes un fugitif.
Roulez, cow-boy !
ll est temps de me dire la vérité.
Sur quoi ?
Vous n'ętes pas agent de change.
Vous étiez crédible en flic,
mais ce n'est pas įa.
Qui ętes-vous ?
Quelqu'un qui ręve
d'un happy end.
Je cherche ma famille.
J'en ai été séparé
quand j'étais petit.
J'en suis séparée aussi.
Par choix.
J'ai fugué ā 1 6 ans.
Comment est-ce possible ?
lls ne vous manquent pas ?
Ma grand-mčre, beaucoup.
C'est la seule qui me comprenne.
Les autres ? Je n'y pense pas.
Sauf ma soeur Katie.
On dit que les jumeaux
sont identiques. C'est faux.
Katie était intelligente,
douée, pleine d'humour.
Personne ne nous confondait.
įa devrait
nous débarrasser de Vince.
La frontičre est ā une heure
vers l'est. Ensuite,
vous serez libre.
On ne va plus vers l'est.
Changement : on va vers le nord.
- Oų ?
- Je vais vous apprendre
une joie de l'enfance que vous
avez ratée : la virée en voiture.
A la base, il s'agit
de faire le plein de bouffe,
de mettre la radio ā fond et...
de rouler.
Assez rigolé.
On est censés trouver quoi ?
Jarod veut qu'on soit
comme des rats dans un labyrinthe.
Ou une fęte foraine.
On ne fait pas la fęte.
C'est quoi, cette lumičre ?
Super. On a suivi le calvaire
de briques jaunes pour trouver
cette horreur ?
C'est Action Joe.
Un de vos amis ?
J'avais le męme, petit.
Avec le męme treillis,
la męme cicatrice.
Quoi ?
ll a un ''B'' sur la semelle.
Comme le mien.
Je l'avais gravé au canif.
C'est votre poupée ?
C'est impossible.
On est dans la Jarod Zone.
Action Joe
était mon meilleur ami.
<i>A 1 2 ans, j'ai eu la rougeole.</i>
<i>J'ai passé l'été ā l'hôpital.</i>
J'ai failli mourir. Aucun ami
ne pouvait venir me voir.
Un jour, mon frčre
m'a refilé Action Joe.
įa m'a rappelé la maison,
ma chambre...
oų tout était si bien.
Je sais que c'est fou,
mais ce bonhomme m'a sauvé la vie.
Vous n'en avez jamais parlé.
Je n'y pensais plus.
- Avant que...
- Jarod vous le rappelle.
Alors ? Pas trop ''beurk'' ?
Pas ''beurk'' du tout.
Vous ętes superbe.
Pourquoi ?
įa vous dit
de jouer un rôle pour moi ?
Vous voulez bien me dire
ce qui se passe ?
Zoey ! Je n'en crois pas mes yeux !
Je suis si contente de te revoir.
J'étais si inquičte
qu'il te soit arrivé quelque chose.
C'est le cas.
J'ai quelqu'un ā te présenter.
Jarod.
Mon mari.
Tu vas l'adorer.
ll est gentil et me gâte
presque autant que toi.
Tu tombes ā merveille.
Ta soeur Linda
et son mari sont lā. Entre
leur annoncer.
Allons leur annoncer, chérie.
Linda, devine qui est lā.
Ta petite soeur.
Elle vient de se marier.
C'est... fabuleux.
Félicitations.
Linda est ma soeur
et voici...
Mon mari, Greg.
Zoey devrait le savoir,
mais n'étant pas venue au mariage,
elle ne l'a pas rencontré.
Qui veut du café ?
Si įa t'intéresse, maman préside
toujours le club des femmes.
Mark et sa femme
ont un 2e fils.
Mark est notre frčre.
ll est débordé.
ll a repris
le cabinet de papa
qui marche du tonnerre.
lls sont 20 associés.
Que faites-vous, Jarod ?
Je touche un peu ā tout.
Ne sois pas si modeste, chéri.
ll est ingénieur aérospatial.
ll dessine des avions.
Le monde est petit.
J'étudie la propulsion
pour la FAA ā Red Valley.
Que pensez-vous
du Northum 6250 ?
ll sera mieux quand ils auront
réglé les problčmes d'allumage.
La plate-forme gyroscopique
a du shimmy
ā haute vitesse,
ce qui dérčgle la télémétrie.
Vraiment ?
Je ne savais pas.
ll est incroyable.
Et comment !
C'est un enfoiré
et en voici la preuve.
Je vous jure
que si įa joue
<i>Over the Rainbow,</i>
je l'explose en mille morceaux.
C'est une chanson franįaise
des années 40.
La langue de l'amour.
C'était le vôtre ?
Quand les Alliés
ont libéré notre camp,
<i>mon frčre Jacob et moi</i>
<i>avons dû rentrer</i>
<i>ā L</i>y<i>on.</i>
<i>La maison que notre pčre</i>
<i>avait bâtie</i>
<i>n'était plus qu'un tas de gravats.</i>
Mais dans les décombres,
nous avons trouvé ce disque.
La chanson préférée de ma mčre.
Elle le mettait et invitait
mon pčre ā danser dessus.
Mon frčre Jacob et moi
devions les regarder.
Je croyais l'avoir perdu
depuis longtemps.
Qu'est-ce que Jarod
essaie de nous dire
avec tout įa ?
Je ne sais pas,
mais j'en suis heureux.
4 enfants,
1 2 petits-enfants
et 1 0 arričre-petits-enfants.
Je suis comblée.
C'est Zoey avec Katie ?
C'est l'une de mes préférées.
C'était quelques semaines
avant que Katie meure.
On aurait dit qu'elles étaient
mortes toutes les deux.
įa a été un choc
pour tout le monde,
mais Zoey était effondrée.
J'imagine... sa soeur jumelle.
La famille a fini
par s'en remettre,
mais elle leur en voulait
d'oublier Katie.
Alors, Zoey s'est éloignée
peu ā peu de la famille.
Et elle a fugué.
Je suis rassurée, maintenant.
De quoi vous causez ?
įa ne te regarde pas.
- Dormez bien.
- Bonne nuit.
A demain matin.
įa a marché !
Le numéro d'ingénieur ?
Parfait. Merci beaucoup.
Pourquoi leur faire croire
des choses ?
Tu ne comprends pas.
Je suis la ratée de la famille.
Pas de projet, pas de carričre,
des relations nulles.
Et mes frčres et soeurs
ont tous réussi.
Ce qu'ils pensent compte ?
Non, mais ma grand-mčre,
je veux qu'elle pense
que j'ai réussi ma vie,
que je suis heureuse.
Męme si c'est un mensonge.
C'est mieux pour elle.
Pourquoi ?
Pour rien.
Je sais comment les convaincre
qu'on est jeunes mariés.
Ne bouge pas.
Quoi ?
Depuis quand sais-tu
que tu es malade ?
Comment tu le sais ?
C'est un traitement
pré-chimiothérapie.
Depuis quand ?
Je ne sais pas.
3 semaines.
Et tu n'as pas acheté
tes médicaments.
J'ai pas eu le temps.
C'est grave. Ton insouciance
ne te guérira pas.
Tu veux quoi,
un mélo ? Désolée,
c'est pas mon genre.
J'irai ā la pharmacie demain.
Pas la peine.
- J'y tiens.
- Pas moi.
J'ai vu des gens
se battre contre ce cancer.
Toute cette souffrance.
Le remčde est pire
que la maladie.
Et la plupart meurent.
Avec les nouveaux traitements,
tu as une bonne chance.
Tu es médecin, aussi ?
Ce n'est plus une maladie mortelle.
La vie en est une.
Tu descends du bus, tu profites
des années qui te restent
et bonsoir, tout le monde.
C'est comme įa.
įa l'a toujours été.
Je ne vais pas pleurnicher
sous prétexte que c'est la fin.
C'est bizarre,
mais c'est une bonne chose.
įa m'a donné la force
de quitter Vince,
de venir voir ma grand-mčre
et l'occasion de te rencontrer.
Tu ne peux pas renoncer
sans lutter.
Si, je peux.
N'en parle ā personne,
surtout pas ā ma grand-mčre.
Promis ?
Je ne l'accepte pas.
ll le faut. C'est ma vie.
Ce sont mes choix.
Et puis je le mérite peut-ętre.
On retourne voir le Munchkin
et on se tire.
Avant de partir, il faut trouver
ce que Jarod vous a laissé.
Je crois qu'on l'a trouvé.
Dorothy portait Toto
dans ce panier.
Si Jarod a abîmé mon toutou,
M. Sheckle, įa va barder.
Un dé ?
Ma famille
n'était pas souvent réunie
quand j'étais petite.
Mon pčre
était toujours au Centre.
S'il était lā, ma mčre
s'occupait d'orphelins.
Mais un jour...
<i>A cause de la tempęte,</i>
<i>les routes étaient bloquées.</i>
<i>Tout était fermé.</i>
<i>Papa, bien sûr, était énervé,</i>
<i>mais j'étais auX anges</i>
<i>car on était tous les trois</i>
<i>pris au pičge</i>
<i>dans la maison.</i>
Alors vous avez cousu ?
On a joué au Monopoly.
On a joué toute la journée
jusqu'au soir.
Papa était la Chaussure,
maman la Voiture
et moi, j'étais...
le Dé.
Pourquoi Jarod
fait įa ?
ll essaie de dire quoi ?
ll n'y a rien de mieux
que chez soi.
Rien de mieux que chez soi.
C'est comme įa
qu'on sort d'ici.
Je veux l'entendre
encore une fois.
On l'a déjā dit trois fois !
Je veux entendre
claquer vos talons.
Vous allez entendre claquer
mon 9 mm
si vous ouvrez pas
cette foutue porte !
Belle arrogance !
Revenez me voir
ā la Ville d'Emeraude.
Je regrette que tu partes déjā.
Moi aussi,
mais Jarod a une conférence
dans le nord.
ll va ętre en retard.
Ne gardez pas ma petite
trop longtemps.
Je veux la revoir bientôt.
Elle reviendra vite.
Avant de partir,
j'ai une surprise pour toi.
Pour ton anniversaire.
C'est dans 2 mois.
D'oų la surprise.
Attends qu'on soit partis.
- Je t'adore.
- Moi aussi.
Merci, Jarod,
d'avoir tenu ta promesse.
Tu devrais lui dire.
Mieux vaut qu'elle ait
ce souvenir de moi.
En train de fuir ?
Heureuse.
Et j'apprécierais
que tu sois heureux aussi.
y en a marre de la morosité.
Je compte profiter
du temps qui me reste.
S<i>i vous passez prčs de freeburg,</i>
<i>venez participer</i>
<i>ā la fęte foraine...</i>
Je veux m'amuser.
Presque chez soi...
Jarod a déjā laissé un indice.
La Méchante Sorcičre.
Elle ne ressemble pas un peu ā...
Je prends įa pour un compliment.
ll doit y avoir
une autre interprétation.
Peut-ętre un sens plus profond ?
Appelez l'aérodrome.
Qu'ils préparent mon balai.
On retourne au Kansas.
Notre chambre est par ici.
Tu es incroyable. J'ai jamais vu
quelqu'un gagner autant.
C'est une simple question
de géométrie et de physique.
J'ai été forain.
Je connais les ficelles.
Pourquoi įa ne m'étonne pas ?
ll nous a donné la chambre nl7.
Oų vas-tu ?
C'est magique. T'as pas envie
de piquer une tęte ?
Regarde, elle nous appelle.
Je n'ai pas de maillot.
Moi non plus.
Je ne sais pas.
Je paie la chambre.
Nage avec moi.
Tu t'es jamais baigné ā poil ?
C'est comme įa qu'on dit ?
Saute, tu verras pourquoi.
Tu es folle, tu sais ?
Et toi, tu traînes.
Que doit faire une femme nue
pour t'attirer ?
C'est pas si terrible.
Pas si terrible...
C'est plutôt agréable.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
C'était une nuit merveilleuse.
Ces derničres 48 h aussi.
L'amour n'était pas au programme.
Quel programme ?
Je dois m'en aller,
seule.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
C'est pas drôle.
Détache-moi.
- La clé !
- Je ne peux pas.
Tu vas guérir !
Non !
Je dois en finir
ā ma faįon.
- Partir en beauté.
- Zoey, non !
Fais semblant
de pas m'avoir connue.
On va quelque part ?
Tu rentres ā la maison.
Ce n'est pas ma maison.
C'est fini, Vince.
Pourquoi t'as payé la chambre
avec la carte de crédit ?
T'as claqué tout le liquide ?
- C'était le mien.
- Le nôtre.
Je te le laisse.
Mais tu m'auras pas.
Tu veux te battre ?
S'il le faut.
Qui c'est, ce mec ?
Elle ne veut pas de vous.
Elle décide pas.
Ni vous. On y va.
Vous avez dû
vous amuser, hier soir.
Pas autant que nous,
ce soir.
Vous ętes gonflé !
Je vous l'accorde.
- Comment tu as su ?
- J'ai eu ta grand-mčre.
C'est ici
que ta soeur est morte.
Je veux te parler.
C'est pas vrai.
Tu veux m'empęcher
de finir mon voyage.
Ce qui est arrivé
est terrible et trčs triste,
mais c'était un accident.
Arręte de t'en vouloir.
C'est moi
qui lui ai dit de grimper.
C'était pour rire,
mais Katie se dégonflait jamais.
Elle était ici
quand elle a glissé.
C'est elle qui aurait dû vivre.
Elle était plus intelligente...
Et tu crois que tu mérites
de mourir ?
On peut pas dire que j'aie réussi
ma vie. J'ai tout raté.
Tu t'es punie de l'accident
de ta soeur.
C'est pour įa
que tu ne te soignes pas.
ll ne s'agit pas de profiter
de la vie ou de partir en beauté.
Tu renonces car pour toi,
tu ne mérites pas de guérir.
J'ai tellement peur.
Je sais. Je vais t'aider.
Mais il n'y a qu'un endroit,
c'est avec ceux que tu aimes.
Pourquoi nous ramener ici
si rien n'a changé ?
Sauf įa. Pas vraiment
des chaussons en rubis.
Jarod s'est endormi
trop longtemps dans le pavot.
Un mot de Jarod ?
Que dit-il ?
''Rien de mieux
que chez soi.''
Histoire d'enfoncer le clou ?
''On mérite tous
un chez-soi.
''Laissez-moi tranquille
et laissez-moi trouver
''le mien.''
Tu es sûre de įa ?
Oui, je suis sûre.
C'est un long combat.
Ne le mčne pas seule.
Je ne suis pas seule.
lls sont lā.
Et tu es lā.
lci.
Je veux rester avec toi.
Je sais.
Mais tu ne peux pas.
Je le vois dans tes yeux.
Merci
de m'avoir montré
le chemin de chez moi.
Au revoir.
Si tu répčtes įa,
je te frappe.
Va-t'en.

Jarod a dŻ pťter un plomb
pour vous envoyer ŗ ses trousses.
Vous Ítes sŻrs
de travailler pour Amway ?
Pourrait-on duper quelqu'un
d'aussi malin que vous ?
C'est ŗ cause
de cette histoire d'Amway.
Je n'aurais jamais imaginť
Jarod vendre du savon.
C'est bien ce que vous vendez ?
Tout, du shampoing pour bťbť
au dťtergent pour piscine.

Regardez ! Match Game,

Jarod se prend
pour le roi de la cascade ?
Un vrai casse-cou, toujours
ŗ faire des trucs dangereux
comme surfer de nuit,
faire de la street luge.
ll a mÍme mis
ce gilet pare-balles,
j'ai dŻ tirer,
les yeux bandťs !
Divers signes d'une obsession
de la prise de risques.
Quelle genre de formation
vous imposez ŗ vos vendeurs ?
Je vous enverrai une brochure.
Une fois de plus,
votre diagnostic arrive trop tard
pour trouver Jarod.
Pas tant que Áa.
ll vient juste de partir.
Les yeux bandťs ?
lnutile, pour sauter d'un pont !
Vous voulez sauter

Vous avez sautť 295 fois avec.
J'ai seulement besoin

L'lRM de M. Goltz
rťvŤle une fracture de l'os
pariťtal droit et un hťmatome.
On a insťrť une sonde
pour en savoir plus sur l'oedŤme.
J'ai notť la prťsence de verre
dans ses cheveux.
J'ai pensť ŗ des lunettes,
mais Tony n'en portait pas.
Pour le sport ?
Non, c'est du verre industriel.
Je l'ai analysť au labo.
Vous et pas la police ?
lls traitent cette affaire
comme un simple accident de saut.
Ni plus ni moins.
Tony ? Mon chťri,
reviens avec nous.
Tu manques ŗ ta soeur et ta mŤre.
Ma famille me manque aussi.
Pardon.
Vous devez Ítre le Dr Nichols.
Jarod.
Asseyez-vous.
A son rťveil, je veux
que Tony se souvienne.
Je ne pensais pas
revoir ces photos.
Tony avait perdu son portefeuille,
mais on l'a trouvť ce matin
dans cette enveloppe,
dans du papier sulfurisť.
Au moins,
les photos y ťtaient encore.
Sa soeur Carrie les a prises.
Puis il est parti
en quÍte de son pŤre.
ll cherchait son pŤre ?
Son pŤre est parti ŗ moto
en 91 .
Chercher sa famille
relŤve de l'instinct.
Sa soeur Carrie
a pris la relŤve.
Peu aprŤs notre arrivťe ici,
elle a disparu.
J'espŤre qu'un jour,
on sourira tous
comme sur ces photos.
La meilleure thťrapie pour lui
est d'entendre
sa famille et ses amis.
ll ne reste que moi.
Ses amis venaient le voir,
mais ils ont arrÍtť.
- Oý sont-ils ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Avec un ami,
Zed, il faisait de la moto
ŗ Willow Ridge. Je suppose
que Zed continue tout seul.
Áa va ?
J'ai toujours rÍvť
de dťcorer un capot.
Je prends Áa pour un oui.
- J'ai cru que vous ťtiez flic.
- Pas aujourd'hui.
Áa va ?
La nana peut se dťbrouiller.
Nana ?
Moi, c'est Jarod.
Les amis m'appellent Shay.
Les amis comme Zed ?
Vous le connaissez ?
Ses amis et lui
font la course sur cette route.
Vous Ítes peut-Ítre vraiment flic.
J'essaie de combattre l'ennui.
Au fait,
bravo pour la course.
C'est pas une escorte de police,
mais j'ai une place libre.
Le motard a embrassť l'asphalte
une fois de trop sans casque.
C'est peut-Ítre
un appel au secours.
Jarod a quittť sa taniŤre ?
Du nouveau
sur sa derniŤre occupation ?
ll s'est transformť
en boulet de canon humain.
Jarod prťsente
tous les signes d'une obsession
de la prise de risques.
ll rajeunit.
Certains optent pour la religion.
Moi, je ressource mon ‚me
par le retour ŗ la nature.
Etonnťe que j'aime camper ?
Non, ťtonnťe que tu aies une ‚me.
Sur cette note de tendresse,
je pars pour trois jours.
Mon bureau sait oý me joindre.
Je peux mourir maintenant,
j'ai tout vu.
On parie ?
Áa vient d'arriver.
DerriŤre

Et quel est le jackpot de Jarod ?
Cette clť ouvre la porte 1 .
Et les autres ?
Elles s'ouvriront
ŗ des intervalles prťdťterminťs.
Qu'est-ce qui se trouve derriŤre
la porte 1 ?
On dirait un biscuit gťant.
C'est un biscuit chinois gťant.
Notre avenir ?
ll ne s'agit pas de l'avenir,
mais du passť.
C'est une vieille note
de restaurant.
''La Vťritť Cachťe''.
La serveuse s'appelait May Lin.
Je passe souvent devant,
j'y suis jamais allť.
Et vous ?
Je dťteste le riz.
Qu'est-ce que Áa signifie ?
Qu'on doit rťserver.
Perdu !
Salut ! Zed, Jojo, Mackey.
Oý t'ťtais passťe ? A la plage ?
En bťcane.
Tu fais de la luge ?
Non, du surf.
Jojo !
ll paraÓt qu'ils vont barrer
la route.
Elle disparaÓtra.
C'est pas trop tŰt.
Zed.
ll est pas tťmoin de Jťhovah ?
J'ai ťtť tťmoin de tas de trucs,
mais pas de Jťhovah.
Tant mieux. Je suis fauchť
et j'ai pas vu Dieu.
Pas depuis la descente du canyon.
Pas vrai ?
- T'aimes la bťcane ?
- Tout et n'importe quoi.
Tu bosses ?
J'ai du mal ŗ garder un boulot.
Je m'ennuie vite.
L'ennui, ce boyau sans fin !
Et toi ?
Un peu de tout.
Tant que Áa rapporte des Cheerios.
Amen !
ll est douť.
Je sais
que tu veux remplacer Tony.
T'es partant ?
S'il s'agit pas que de faire
de la luge dans un canyon,
pourquoi pas ?
Si t'en as, amŤne-les !
A toi de voir.
200 mŤtres.
Garde tes roues
sur la bande jaune.
C'est l'occasion
de faire sourire les dieux.
Alors, allons-y.
C'est parti.
Je suis douťe,
mais Zed est gťnial.
Reste sur tes gardes.
Bravo, J Man. MÍme mon pote Tony
est pas allť aussi loin.
y a une place dans ma tribu.
J'ai rien de mieux ŗ faire.
J'ai jamais vu Zed adopter
quelqu'un aussi vite.
Áa va, Áa vient, je suppose.
Tu parles de Tony ?
C'est qui ?
ll ťtait dans la bande
avant mon arrivťe.
ll a eu un accident
en sautant ŗ l'ťlastique.
L'ťlastique s'est cassť ?
Effilochť pendant son saut.
Les mťdecins
sont pas trŤs optimistes.
Comme dit Zed, le 1 er
qui arrive ŗ 40 ans a perdu.
Content que tu sois venu.
Le vendredi soir,
on fait pas vraiment bal musette.
On aime essayer
de nouveaux trucs.
Faisons sourire les dieux.
Non, faisons-les ťclater de rire.
Si le cerveau est libre,
le corps est libre.
Si le corps est libre,
l'‚me est libre.
Tu croyais faire du deltaplane ?
A l'Óle Maurice,
ceux qui marchent sur le feu
apprennent ŗ canaliser la peur.
A crťer un pouvoir...
indťniable.
Ce pouvoir est gratuit.
Sers-toi.
Rien n'est gratuit.
Tu es esclave
des mÍmes dťmons que moi.
Sans dťmons,
il ne peut pas y avoir d'anges.
Pour ta gouverne.
Du basalte. Áa conduit
bien mieux la chaleur.
Si tu veux libťrer ton ‚me,
libŤre-la.
Notre repas chinois
ťtait un bide.
Du nouveau
sur la note de restaurant ?
Mon pote Bodie a fait
une recherche pour moi.
Celui qui a la cataracte ?
ll a plus de lait dans les yeux
qu'une vache.
ll dit que pour Halloween,
il joue au zombie.
Les rťsultats !
Les empreintes
sont celles de la serveuse.
May Lin.
Elle est partie
sans laisser d'adresse.
Un bide !
La porte numťro 2 s'est ouverte.
Venez voir.
<i>Merci ! C'est l'heure</i>
<i>d'un jeu palpitant :</i>
Trouvez l'indice.
<i>lci Jarod Win</i>k<i>erdale.</i>
Voyons

Tchernobyl

<i>Notre candidate d'aujourd'hui</i>

<i>Elle doit trouver l'indice</i>
<i>pour gagner un sťjour</i>

<i>Mlle Par</i>k<i>er... voici votre indice.</i>
<i>La vťritť cachťe</i>

<i>mais vous ne la trouverez</i>

La Vťritť Cachťe.
Le restaurant.
Et May qui a disparu.
La serveuse May Lin a disparu.
Pour la trouver,
il faut rťclamer votre prix.
Un sťjour dans les superbes
Chalets de l'Amour.
Superbes, tu parles !
<i>Ton</i>y <i>avait perdu son portefeuille,</i>
<i>mais on l'a trouvť ce matin</i>
<i>dans cette enveloppe,</i>
<i>dans du papier sulfurisť.</i>
4 $.
- Dťlicieux.
- Forcťment !
Harry fait les meilleurs hot-dogs
de la ville.
4 dollars.
Mon portefeuille !
Je l'ai pas vu !
Vous avez du flair
pour les portefeuilles,
je pensais que vous saviez
oý ťtait le mien.
J'ai regardť les infos.
Le type ťtait dans le coma,
j'ai culpabilisť.
Un voleur plein d'honneur !
Je l'ai pas volť.
Je l'ai trouvť,
en balayant du verre.
Du verre industriel.
ll ťtait sur le trottoir.
Le lendemain du cambriolage
chez le numismate.
Des types sont passťs
d'un b‚timent ŗ l'autre
par les fenÍtres.
Faut Ítre fou pour faire Áa.
Ou bien chercher son ‚me.
Tu fais quoi ?
Je cherche une clť
pour rťparer ma moto.
Et toi ?
Je t'ai pris pour Zed.
Tu as pris cette photo ?
Non.
C'ťtait avant que j'arrive ici.
C'est Tony ?
Je crois.
Zed en parlait beaucoup
aprŤs l'accident.
Plus que maintenant.
Tony et Zed ťtaient trŤs amis ?
Tony ťtait un intime de Zed.
Avec Zed, il s'agit toujours
de frisson suprÍme,
de dťfier les autres
pour qu'ils se trouvent.
Quand on est prÍt, on tente
le frisson suprÍme.
Le frisson suprÍme
ou l'ťpreuve suprÍme ?
- Les deux.
- Tu y as ťtť invitťe ?
ll me croit pas encore prÍte.
Et Tony ?
C'ťtait le frisson suprÍme
ou l'ťpreuve suprÍme ?
Je sais pas.
Je fais pas partie des initiťs.
Je voulais pas dťranger.
On va s'ťclater quand ?
Je suis pas lŗ pour glander.
Tes joyeux lurons et toi,
vous vous ťclatez.
Ces joyeux lurons sont des gens
qui ont fait leurs preuves,
repoussť leurs limites.
Et la loi ?
Tes jouets, c'est pas
le PŤre NoŽl qui les a apportťs.
Tant que Áa rapporte
des Cheerios !
T'as ce qu'il faut ?
Je sais pas.
A toi d'en juger !
C'est simple.
Je te jette ŗ l'eau,
puis je lance une clť.
Objectif : te libťrer
avant de mourir.
C'est trop.
Un esprit fermť est atrophiť.
Conquiers la peur.
ll faut goŻter ŗ la mort
pour vivre.
Pas vrai ?
J'allais oublier.
- Tu peux conquťrir la peur ?
- Tu seras ťtonnť.
Une minute.
Lance la clť.
ll commence ŗ peine.
Tu fais quoi ?
Je l'aide ŗ dťcouvrir
tout son potentiel.
Et toi, Shay,
tu irais jusqu'oý ?
90 secondes.
2 mn.
ll a pas besoin d'aide.
2'1 5.
L'esprit conquiert le corps.
Bienvenue...
parmi les joyeux lurons.
May Lin a sťjournť
dans ce chalet.
Parfait.
J'essayť de discuter un peu
avec elle,
mais elle ťtait distante.
Je ne vois pas
ce qui pouvait la gÍner ici !
Moi non plus. Mais ces gens
prťfŤrent rester entre eux.
PlutŰt raciste, non ?
Non. Je suis pas un rustre.
Je parlais de son genre.
Les cťlibataires.
Vous Ítes libre ?
Tout comme vos membres
seront libres dans la nature
si vous continuez
ŗ me mater, M. Datsun.
May Lin a dťcampť
en pleine nuit
sans payer sa note.
Elle a laissť ses affaires.
3 robes,
corsages,
chaussures, chaussettes,
du maquillage et 6...
slips noirs.
J'ai dŻ faire l'inventaire.
- Je n'en doute pas.
- Áa fait flipper.
Une belle fille qui disparaÓt...
Oui, Áa fait flipper.
Une bonne clť,
c'est dur ŗ trouver...
Carrie !
Comment tu sais ?
La douleur dans tes yeux
en voyant ton frŤre sur la photo.
Tony est ton frŤre.
Ta mŤre s'inquiŤte.
Je saurai
ce qui est arrivť ŗ Tony.
Zed est responsable,
mais je manque de preuves.
Mťfie-toi de Zed.
ll parle de vie et de mort,
mais c'est toi
qui risques la mort.
Je veux t'aider,
fais-moi confiance.
Tony m'a dit
qu'il avait rencontrť...
ce Zed qui lui avait promis
de l'aider ŗ trouver notre pŤre.
ll disait avoir connu papa
en 96.
Tony lui a fait confiance,
il l'a cru.
Et aprŤs ?
Le soir de son accident,
Tony a appelť.
Notre grand-mŤre avait tťlťphonť
pour la 1 re fois
depuis des annťes.
Elle a dit que mon pŤre
ťtait mort en 92.
Bien avant
que Zed ait pu le connaÓtre.
Zed faisait marcher ton frŤre.
Tony s'est f‚chť et a dit
qu'il rťglerait Áa avec Zed.
Mais il a pas eu le temps.
Peut-Ítre que si.
Tout Áa te dťpasse.
Rentre chez toi.
Je dťcouvrirai la vťritť.
Pas question !
Quand on cherche ma famille,
on me trouve !
Ecoute...
Je te connais mÍme pas !
Je sais pas
comment tu es mÍlť ŗ Áa,
mais... je t'aime bien.
Ne me mets pas de b‚tons
dans les roues.
Le Chalet vous a appris
quelque chose ?
A ruiner une paire de Gucci
avec de la terre rouge.
TrŤs drŰle. Ce sťjour
ťtait une partie de rigolade,
gr‚ce ŗ Jarod qui se prend
pour Alex Trebek.
C'est Monty Hall.
On va savoir
jusqu'oý Áa va.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
De quoi nettoyer vos thťories.
ll y a un mot.
''Gare ŗ ce que vous dťterrez.''
Une adresse !
Celle de Lyle.
Áa dťpend de toi.
Tu en dis quoi ?
L'invitation
est valable pour toi.
J'ai prťvu une excursion
de l'autre cŰtť ce soir.
Si Áa te tente.
Ce que Jarod peut affronter,
moi aussi.
MÍme la mort ?
Quand les dieux ont crťť l'homme,
ils ont vu la mort
et ont gardť la vie pour eux.
Si on peut pas
vivre ťternellement,
vivons au moins !
Affrontons les dieux.
AprŤs ce soir,
il n'y aura plus de limites.
Ne fais pas Áa, Carrie.
C'est Shay. Ne l'oublie pas.
Bonne nouvelle.
La maison est vide,
c'est plus facile.
ll y a des plans
dans le bureau.
Rapporte-les,
tu seras rťcompensťe.
Je dois cambrioler la maison ?
C'est pas voler,
c'est repousser les limites.
- Elle est pas prÍte.
- Si !
Je sais que tu peux.
Mais tu le sens ?
Tu sens le danger ?
Tu vas passer de l'autre cŰtť.
ll y a un cambriolage.
1 600 Seaward.
Tu la piŤges ?
J'ajoute une pincťe
de Tabasco ŗ la soupe.
Elle est pas prÍte
pour un tel danger.
ll y a qu'un moyen de le savoir.
Pardon.
ll y a erreur.
Ma fille avait oubliť sa clť.
De quoi tu te mÍles ?
J'essaie de placer la barre
plus haut.
Rien ne vaut la police
pour relever la soupe.
Vas-y.
Dťmarre !
C'est moi !
J'ai rťussi, j'ai les plans !
Tu saignes.
Je me suis coupťe en entrant.
Faites le tour.
Fonce !
Les Cheerios
sont dans le placard, J Man.
Je cherchais de quoi
arrÍter le saignement.
Mourir d'hťmorragie,
quel intťrÍt ?
Que ce soit un acte suicidaire
ou un saut,
il s'agit de confiance.
- En soi et en son entourage.
- La confiance est la clť.
La trousse de secours
est dans l'entrťe.
C'est moi, Jarod. On s'en va.
Zed t'a cherchť toute la nuit.
Pour le dernier dťfi ?
Viens avec moi.
Je dois prouver que cet enfoirť
a mis mon frŤre dans le coma.
Ce sera dur, si tu es en prison.
J'ai dťcouvert une couverture
pour blanchir de l'argent.
ll se servira de toi
pour voler du fric.
Comme il s'est servi de ton frŤre
le soir de son ''accident''.
Maintenant, on s'en va.
Áa m'ťtonnerait, J !
Ton frŤre Tony ťtait trŤs dťtendu
ŗ 30 ťtages.
Mais toi, t'es un peu p‚le.
Áa fait rien,
tu seras l'agneau du sacrifice.
Pas vrai, toubib ?
Jojo t'a suivi ŗ l'hŰpital.
Je sais pas qui tu es
sous ta fausse identitť.
On y va.
Tony a dŻ ťprouver Áa
quand tu l'as poussť du pont.
Tu nous manqueras.
Je l'ai lestť.
Salue les dieux pour moi.
ll va mourir !
EmmŤne-la.
J'espŤre que Lyle
fait du camping.
On manque d'air ici.
Áa me fout la trouille
d'Ítre ici.
Un vrai dťcor de kung-fu !
Du resto chinois
aux Chalets de l'Amour,
en passant par ce temple
de la constipation,
Jarod nous a baladťs
dans son enfer. Pourquoi ?
Pour dťcrocher le gros lot
chez Lyle.
Quelque chose d'incongru.
Quelque chose de dťplacť.
Un grain de poussiŤre serait
dťplacť dans cette piaule.
J'ai trouvť ses notes de frais.
C'est trŤs rťvťlateur,
la faÁon de dťpenser son argent.
Mon frangin sans pouce
fait tout payer au Centre,
des bas de soie aux laxatifs.
Et le resto.
ll y a plus d'une douzaine
d'additions de La Vťritť Cachťe.
Oý travaillait May Lin.
ll a aussi des notes
des Chalets de l'Amour.
ll est parti
le mÍme jour que May Lin.
Deux pelles !
Avec de la terre rouge dessus.
Comme sur vos chaussures.
ll y a une porte.
Áa ne me dit rien de bon.
Souriez.
On a dťcrochť le jackpot.
Une remise,
comme celles envoyťes par Jarod.
Áa n'a pas de sens.
Au contraire.
M. Lyle s'enferme ici.
Áa a un sens ?
Enfant,
son pŤre adoptif
l'enfermait pendant des semaines.
On essaie tous
de prťserver son enfance.
Par un rituel ou un autre.
Pour Lyle,
cette remise
est le seul endroit
au monde
oý il se sent en sťcuritť.
Quel rapport avec May Lin ?
Justement.
Le mot est ''torture''.
Le mot est ''meurtre''.
Et il dort dans une remise
semblable ŗ celle
oý il a ťtť torturť.
ll kidnappe des femmes asiatiques
qu'il ramŤne dans une chambre...
de torture.
Qui est Lyle ?
Ou bien quoi ?
Le fric est tout prŤs.
Áa y est !
Jour de paie ! Allez-y.
Souris.
C'est censť Ítre le plus drŰle.
Allons-y.
Un frisson gťnial !
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
C'est fou, ce qu'on peut faire
avec une pince et une clť.
EnlŤve ces menottes !
Mais alors,
oý serait le frisson ?
A propos,
j'ai une surprise pour toi.
Ne t'en va pas.
Va voir ta mŤre,
elle s'inquiŤte.
Áa va pas ?
Je suis plus sympa que toi
avec Tony.
Je te laisse une chance.
Mais faible.
Tu fais quoi ?
Le frisson suprÍme,
l'ťpreuve suprÍme.
Ou bien le ''plaf'' suprÍme ?
Cet ťlastique est vieux,
je me demande s'il tiendra.
Comme tu dis,
l'heure est venue
d'affronter les dieux.
Remonte-moi !
Tu sens ?
Tu sens la peur ? Aller simple
pour le frisson suprÍme.
ArrÍte !
Tu as laissť sa chance ŗ Tony ?
ll t'a cru.
ll a cru que tu l'aiderais
ŗ trouver son pŤre.
ll a dťcouvert
que tu te servais de lui.
Tony avait du cran,
mais il ťtait bÍte !
ll allait te dťnoncer,
alors tu l'as fait sauter
avec un ťlastique usť.
Mais il n'est pas mort !
ll est dans un lit d'hŰpital,
prisonnier de son corps.
ll n'ťprouvera peut-Ítre
plus jamais de frisson.
Mais lŗ encore,
toi non plus.
PrÍt ?
J'avoue !
Je savais
que Tony allait me dťnoncer !
ArrÍte !
Dťtends-toi, Zed.
Tu sens ?
Tu sens le danger ?
C'est ton passage
de l'autre cŰtť !
Bon voyage !
Comme tu dis,
il faut goŻter ŗ la mort
pour savourer la vie.
Finalement, l'ťlastique a tenu.
Sors-moi de lŗ !
Belle journťe dans le coin !
Jarod se prend pour Monty Hall ?
M. Lyle, vous semblez si...
Dťtendu ?
J'arrive des montagnes.
Votre piste sur Jarod ?
Tout Áa n'ťtait...
qu'une impasse.
Une ''remise'' ŗ niveau
sur la personnalitť de Jarod ?
Non, pas sur la sienne.
Ne le prenez pas mal,
mais vous avez une sale mine.
Vous devriez vous reposer
au grand air,
ťliminer le stress.
Áa me donne l'impression
d'Ítre... vivant.
Je vais vomir.
L'un de nous doit l'arrÍter.
<i>C'ťtait trop tard pour Ma</i>y <i>Lin.</i>
J'ouvrirai l'oeil. Comptes-y.
<i>On a pris un sacrť risque</i>
en allant chez Lyle.
Parfois Áa vaut la peine
de prendre
des risques.
Rendez-vous au prochain...
jeu tťlťvisť.

NlCE FELLOW
Jarod a envoyé ça.
Elles ont été prises récemment.
Portland, Houston, Lexington.
Quelqu'un nous traque.
Pas ''nous''.
Vous. Regardez.
Le chasseur devient la proie.
QUl ?
On t'espionne.
La question est qui !
<i>Parfois,</i>
<i>la réponse est la question.</i>
Pas de casse-tęte chinois !
C'est noble, de parcourir
le monde et d'aider les gens.
Comme j'essaie de vous aider,
toi et ton pčre.
Mon pčre ?
Que voulait-il dire ?
Bon sang !
Qu'y a-t-il, Parker ?
Mon pčre se cache toujours
et m'a envoyé un e-mail étrange.
ll m'a dit
de ne me fier ŕ personne.
Le Centre a mis sa tęte ŕ prix.
Pourquoi on vous a suivie ?
Dans l'espoir
que je les mčne ŕ la vraie cible.
Que personne ne touche
mes cartes !
Sinon gare ŕ vous !
Sales ratons laveurs !
J'ai quelque chose pour vous,
charognes !
ll nage tranquillement
dans son milieu naturel,
vous lancez l'hameçon,
vous l'attrapez,
puis vous le relâchez ?
C'est compréhensible.
Dites ça au poisson !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Des chasseurs
ont fait une drôle de prise.
Poussez-vous.
Ne complique pas les choses.
Allez, dans la voiture !
Donnez-moi ça.
Vous avez déjŕ vu ça ?
<i>On m'a enlevé ŕ ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjŕ</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>ŕ cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>ll défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous ętes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Trouvez-moi le Dr Bennett.
ll faut un linguiste
et un pédiatre.
Un vétérinaire !
L'Etat envoie quelqu'un.
- Assistante sociale ?
- Psychiatre.
Le temps presse.
Arrętez-la !
Elle n'a jamais vu de fenętre.
ça va aller. Tout se passera bien.
On a tort de la traiter ainsi.
Elle a peur d'ętre touchée.
A nous de donner
les instructions, Dr...
Bell, Jarod Bell.
Le psy de l'Etat.
On nous a prévenus
de votre arrivée.
Voici le Dr Bennett.
Dr Wolverton.
J'ai lu votre livre.
<i>Effets de l'isolement</i>
<i>sur le ps</i>y<i>chisme humain.</i>
Votre théorie
a soulevé bien des débats.
Je suis controversé en matičre
de médecine psychosociale.
C'est toujours dur
de se démarquer.
Vu son apparence
et son incapacité verbale,
elle a dű ętre isolée trčs jeune.
Mais pourquoi a-t-elle décidé
d'établir le contact ?
Tout va s'arranger.
Si on la met en confiance,
elle commencera ŕ communiquer.
On n'a pas le temps.
Sans tuteur légal, les services
sociaux vont la récupérer.
Aucune famille ?
La police diffuse sa photo.
En attendant, profitons
du temps que nous avons
avec notre spécimen.
Amenez-la.
On vous cherchait.
Bonne nouvelle ?
Les numéros des photos
sont des codes
utilisés pour les communiqués
du Triumvirat.
Matumbo !
L'assassin les a envoyées
en Afrique.
J'ai pu isoler sa désignation.
ll se fait appeler ''Le Hibou''.
Selon les fichiers du personnel,
cette désignation
est utilisée par M. Cox.
La Faucheuse.
Jarod nous aura prévenus !
Je veux tout savoir
sur notre photographe tordu.
La base de données sur M. Cox
est vide.
La seule preuve que l'on ait
de son existence,
c'est parce qu'on l'a vu.
- Fouillez son bureau.
- ll n'en a pas.
Mais écoutez ça.
J'ai parlé ŕ Rory
du service des achats.
L'unijambiste ?
Non, ça, c'est Rudy,
des renseignements.
Rory a une tache sur le front
en forme de...
Rory m'a dit que M. Cox
avait commandé
du matériel chirurgical
qu'il a fait livrer ici.
- Vérifiez.
- Je m'y mets.
Et si M. Cox était vraiment
la Faucheuse ?
Raison de plus
pour qu'il ne trouve pas mon pčre.
Qu'elle reste au chaud.
Je n'aime pas la voir enfermée.
Je suis le Dr Solvang. Ann.
Dr Jarod Bell, psychiatre.
Elle a besoin
de son milieu familier. Plantes,
soleil...
Désolé, mais c'est impossible.
Elle doit rester
dans un environnement stérile.
On ne connaît pas
son systčme immunitaire.
Ses signes vitaux
sont hors normes.
Le pouls est ŕ 1 50.
ll faut un sédatif léger.
Pas de traitement.
lnteraction minimale.
On est lŕ pour observer.
ll faut essayer
de communiquer avec elle !
Elle est incapable
de communiquer.
Hélas, elle ne pourra pas
apprendre avant longtemps.
Je suis d'accord.
On a une occasion unique
d'étudier l'animal humain.
Spécimen, animal...
Et l'ętre humain ?
Excusez-nous,
la presse nous attend.
ça va ?
Je ne peux pas me faire
ŕ son regard. Si triste...
si perdu.
ll suffit d'une personne
pour tout changer.
Rčgle cardinale
des patients traumatisés :
pas d'investissement affectif.
Vous ne le pensez pas vraiment.
D'oů viens-tu, petite fille ?
Elle parle ?
Elle vous comprend ?
Nous n'avons pas encore
de réponses.
Mais ce centre de recherches
est le meilleur de l'Etat.
Nous avons réuni
les plus grands spécialistes.
Elle a subi des sévices ?
Comment se sent-elle ?
Comme l'a dit le Dr Bennett,
notre équipe travaille lŕ-dessus.
Nous vous tiendrons au courant.
Pas d'autres questions.
Pas d'autres questions.
Elle est jolie.
Vous assistez le Dr Bennett ?
Pas vraiment. Dr Jarod Bell.
Leslie Twain,
du Salt Lake Chronicle.
Si je pouvais la photographier
et faire un article,
ça permettrait de l'identifier.
Mon article paraîtrait
dans tout le pays...
Le Dr Bell n'est pas habilité
pour ça.
Rassurez-vous,
on contrôle la situation.
Rejoignez les autres.
Bon sang, oů est-elle passée ?
Fouillez le bâtiment.
C'est fait, de fond en comble.
- Et la presse ?
- lls sont partis.
- Qu'allez-vous faire ?
- C'est pour son bien.
Cette arme n'est pas faite
pour les humains.
Le sujet est...
Le ''sujet''
est une fillette terrifiée !
Laissez-nous faire notre travail.
Que faire ?
ll faut la retrouver avant eux.
Tenez-moi ça.
Je ne vais pas te faire mal.
Vas-y, prends-la.
ça t'amuse ?
Je crois que tu as raison.
Elle réagit
au changement d'environnement.
Elle respire plus facilement.
Que lui avez-vous dit
dans l'arbre ?
Rien. On a simplement ri.
Pourquoi ces plantes ?
- La pičce doit ętre stérile.
- Elle ne risque rien.
Le sujet est trop important.
Le sujet ?
Si on lui donnait un nom ?
Lui conférer une personnalité
nuirait aux résultats de l'étude.
Violet.
Violet... ça me plaît !
Elle a parlé !
Que dit-elle ?
C'est du mimétisme phonétique.
Elle veut communiquer.
- Qu'a-t-elle ?
- Elle fait une crise.
Aidez-moi !
Elle est brűlante !
Dr Bennett, ma trousse !
Allez la chercher !
Rentrez dormir chez vous.
Plus tard.
On a les résultats.
La grippe est passée au travers
de son systčme immunitaire.
Elle a réagi au traitement.
C'était effrayant
de la voir comme ça.
Vous vous investissez
affectivement ?
Je ne comprends pas.
Sa chambre était stérile.
Et aucun d'entre nous
ne semble malade.
D'oů vient ce virus ?
Elle veut sa poupée.
ça la calme.
Que faites-vous ?
C'est un mélange
de rhume et de grippe.
ll y a au moins...
dix virus différents.
Ou douze.
La poupée a été
volontairement contaminée ?
Une douzaine de virus
ne peuvent pas contaminer
une si petite surface !
Je ne comprends pas. Pourquoi ?
Quelqu'un qui connaît la situation
a peur que Violet
ne commence ŕ communiquer.
C'est de la folie !
Ces hommes sont des experts.
Wolverton a sauvé des vies
et Bennett est un pionnier.
Je connais le palmarčs,
mais pas les hommes.
ll faut la sortir d'ici.
Je ne peux pas vous aider.
Je vous ai vue.
Pour vous,
c'est plus qu'une patiente.
De quoi avez-vous peur ?
J'avais un fils. Matthew.
ll avait l'âge de Violet
quand il est tombé malade.
Je l'ai emmené dans
les meilleures cliniques du pays.
Chez les meilleurs médecins.
Je ne l'ai pas sauvé.
Désolé.
Le perdre... a failli me tuer.
Je ne veux pas revivre ça.
Je ne veux plus.
Vous savez
d'oů vient la maladie ?
Oui, j'allais vous en parler
demain matin.
ll semble que l'infection...
provenait de sa poupée.
C'est trčs étrange.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Elle a quitté sa chambre.
Elle a disparu.
Bon sang !
Violet, oů es-tu ?
Tout va bien, c'est ma voiture.
ça va ?
Attendez, arrętez !
Laissez-moi encore une chance
de l'aider.
C'est la 4e fois que Cox s'arręte.
ll cherche quoi ?
J'aurais jamais imaginé Cox
dans un pick-up.
C'est une énigme.
J'ai parlé ŕ Rory,
du service des achats.
ll ignore oů a été livré
le matériel chirurgical.
On tourne en rond.
Une minute !
Une pelle !
Sapristi !
C'est un truc mort
qu'il prend en photo.
Comme quand il vous a suivie.
Merci de la comparaison.
Ne me dites pas
qu'il va emporter ça !
Et maintenant ?
On le suit.
S'il trouve mon pčre,
on est morts.
Vous ętes sűr
qu'elle vient de lŕ ?
L'hiver est trop rude pour
survivre sans source de chaleur.
Selon la carte,
il y a une source chaude ici.
L'eau est chaude.
Elle doit vivre prčs d'ici.
lntéressant.
D'oů vient le verre ?
Et ça ?
C'est quoi ?
Ce sont peut-ętre
les parents de Violet.
C'est possible ?
Oů va-t-elle ?
Mon Dieu ! Une carcasse d'avion.
Ce sont ses parents.
C'est quoi ?
On dirait un câble vidéo.
<i>Disparition d'une famille</i>
<i>en avion</i>
- Comment elle va ?
- Elle se repose.
Comment quelqu'un aurait pu
savoir et ne rien faire ?
D'aprčs ces photos,
ça dure depuis 1 0 ans.
ça vous tient ŕ coeur ?
Oui, ça me tient ŕ coeur.
Racontez-moi.
Vous ne me croiriez pas.
Essayez.
Une autre fois.
Oů allez-vous ?
Chercher le coupable.
Quelqu'un est mort ?
Oů étiez-vous ?
A un enterrement.
A Dover.
M. Cox y a passé la nuit.
ll connaît le proprio.
Le vieux ?
Je ne pense pas
qu'il soit lié au Centre.
Bizarrement, M. Cox a utilisé
la porte de service.
ll avait de gros sacs.
J'ignore leur contenu.
Qu'est-ce qui sort par la porte
de service d'une morgue ?
Des morceaux de corps.
Le contenu
a été envoyé
au niveau souterrain 6.
C'était l'infirmerie
quand j'étais enfant.
On m'y a enlevé les amygdales.
ll ne donne pas de sucettes
aux fillettes.
Du moins, pas aux vivantes.
Allons rendre visite
ŕ la Faucheuse.
Donnez-moi les photos.
Que fait-on ici ?
ll faut que Cox
se sente surveillé lui aussi.
Vous avez perdu quelque chose ?
Vous avez le sens
de la décoration.
C'est lŕ qu'on vous a opérée
des amygdales, non ?
J'ai vidé les placards
pleins de dossiers.
Pour y mettre
des morceaux de corps ?
Vous allez ŕ la morgue
avec des sacs mystérieux.
Vous ramassez des bętes mortes.
Vous m'avez suivi.
Vous me surveillez,
attendez-vous
ŕ une revanche.
Qui est cet homme ?
ll s'appelle Carl.
C'est mon pčre.
ll est entrepreneur
de pompes funčbres ?
Avant,
on avait de longues discussions
sur la vie pendant
qu'il embaumait des corps.
Maintenant, on échange
des astuces sur mon passe-temps.
Une fois,
mon pčre m'a offert un mécano.
Votre passe-temps ?
La taxidermie.
Ma collection offre
une seconde chance ŕ la vie.
On remplace les yeux
par des billes de verre.
Selon certaines cultures,
je vole la capacité
ŕ trouver son chemin
dans l'au-delŕ.
En tout cas,
c'est la théorie de papa.
Les papas, c'est chouette.
A propos...
comment va votre pčre ?
Vous aimeriez le savoir !
Ce n'est pas moi
qui ai pris ces photos de vous.
Mais... je vous ai ŕ l'oeil.
C'est une des premičres vidéos.
Tournée prčs du lieu du crash.
Celle-ci a été prise
Comment a-t-elle survécu
si longtemps ?
Par pur instinct.
Elle s'est blessée ŕ la cheville.
Un pičge pour animaux !
Elle est restée
longtemps comme ça ?
Apparemment, 3 jours.
Qui aurait pu faire ça ?
Regardez.
Mon Dieu !
C'est le Dr Wolverton !
J'en reviens pas !
ll n'en reviendra pas non plus.
Comment ça, Cox a dit la vérité ?
J'ai trouvé ça.
Les notes de frais de Lyle.
Lyle a acheté
un appareil photo trčs cher.
A votre avis, quel appareil
a pris ces photos ?
- Et il y a ça.
- Un mémo du Centre.
Lyle a fait entrer M. Cox
au Centre et il a créé son poste.
Mon frčre est derričre tout ça.
ll essaie de tuer mon pčre ?
Tu perds la tęte !
Tu as pris ces photos.
Cet assassin de Cox est ŕ ta solde.
Je voudrais faire tuer
mon pčre... notre pčre ?
Ne te considčre pas
comme de la famille.
Si tu faisais attention,
tu verrais
que j'essaie de l'aider.
Comme toi.
Moi aussi,
j'ai reçu un e-mail de papa.
ll m'a fichu la trouille.
ll risque de lui arriver
une chose terrifiante.
ll m'a dit de prendre ces photos
et de les transmettre
au Triumvirat
pour ton alibi.
Pourquoi ?
Je ne sais pas.
ll m'a dit
d'en faire autant pour moi.
Quelque chose d'important
se prépare et Matumbo va venir.
lci ?
Selon papa, pour voir Cox.
Je ne devrais pas te le dire.
ll m'a dit de me méfier de tous.
A moi aussi.
Et maintenant ?
On attend. Et on prie.
N'aie pas peur.
Voilŕ ta poupée.
Je te surveille
depuis longtemps.
Je ne suis jamais intervenu.
Je ne t'ai jamais fait mal.
Tu le sais.
Ton destin résulte
des lois de la nature.
Pas de l'Homme, pas de moi.
Tiens.
Je regrette d'avoir ŕ faire ça,
mais nul ne doit savoir.
Qui est l'animal, maintenant ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
C'est déroutant, hein ?
lmaginez ce que c'est
pour une enfant de 4 ans.
Donnez-moi mes vętements !
Mes chaussures !
ça pourrait nuire
ŕ l'intégrité de mon étude.
Violet n'avait rien
quand vous l'avez trouvée.
ça n'a rien changé
que je la trouve.
Je n'ai été qu'un observateur.
C'était une étude scientifique.
Qui vous a rapporté gros, hein ?
Livres, bourses de recherches,
notoriété.
Vos données ne reposaient pas
sur des recherches,
mais sur la terreur
d'une orpheline !
Combien de temps
a-t-elle souffert de la faim ?
- Aidez-moi.
- lmpossible.
Avec le froid,
le manque de sommeil,
la faim, vous serez
un spécimen
quand on vous trouvera.
C'est de la folie !
Je peux mourir ici !
C'est possible.
Laissons les lois de la nature
en décider.
Sauf si vous avouez.
Non ? Tant pis.
Amusez-vous bien.
D'accord, je l'ai laissée ici !
Que Dieu me pardonne.
Qu'ai-je fait ?
Voilŕ de la compagnie
si vous vous sentez seul.
<i>Un médecin arręté</i>
<i>pour maltraitance d'enfant</i>
Comment vous remercier ?
C'est ŕ moi de vous remercier.
ll faut du courage pour demander
la garde légale de Violet.
Disons que j'ai reçu un message.
Vous ne me croiriez pas.
Essayez.
J'ai fait un ręve cette nuit.
Mon fils est venu vers moi
et m'a dit que tout irait bien,
qu'il ne voulait plus
que je sois seule.
C'est de la folie ?
C'est parfait.
Pour moi ?
Merci.
J'ai quelque chose pour toi.
Ton... coeur.
Sois heureuse.
Tu as une nouvelle poupée !

Fletcher Ridge, lllinois.
ll y a un chauffeur
du nom de Jarod Harper.
Très bien.
Physiquement ?
La même corpulence que Jarod.
ll a pris ce poste
quasiment au moment
où je l'ai localisé.
Appelez Lyle.
ll arrive.
Allons-y.
<i>ll faut que je te voie.</i>
<i>La casse</i>

de Quentin Street.
Papa ?
Des ennuis ?
Vous n'avez pas une vente
de charité à organiser ?
Je sais
que vous avez des soucis.
C'est pourquoi je vous donne ceci.
Pour prier.
J'ai dormi avec cette carte.
D'où les taches de gras.
J'ai prié pour que vous trouviez
des réponses.
Dieu vous bénisse.
Vous aussi.
Parker ? On vous attend.
Je reviens.
- Et Jarod ?
- Et Lyle ?
Laissez-moi quelques heures.
Désolé, elle m'a échappé.
Pas mal !
Cadeau de la petite souris.
On perd une dent, la petite souris

Quand vous étiez enfant,
vous le faisiez pas ?
Je n'ai jamais vraiment
été enfant.
Merci.
Tais-toi !
Je veux plus parler de ça.
On n'a pas le choix, Sarah.
On n'a pas à se mêler de ça.
Tu parles !
A l'hôpital, ils se fichent
qu'un Larsen meure.
Billy !
J'ai entendu les médecins !
Je sais ce qu'il faut faire !
Tu es armé ?
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
C'est pas moi qui ai commencé.
Rentre chez toi !
Bon sang !
Tenez.
Prenez le mien.
<i>Police secours, j'écoute.</i>
Je m'appelle Sarah Larsen.
Mes frères

lls sont armés.

Que tout le monde

Si on peut tirer, prévenez-moi.
lntéressant. On tire d'abord,
on discute ensuite.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Agent Jarod Jackson,
FBl de Chicago.
Je viens négocier pour les otages.
A moi de jouer.
Bon sang !
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>

<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>

<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>

<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>ll défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
Aujourd'hui, oui.
ll y a une demi-douzaine d'otages,
dont trois patients
qui risquent la mort
sans traitement.
Arrêtez l'alarme.
Les preneurs d'otages ?
Billy Larsen, 21 ans,
pas de casier
et son grand frère Cam, 28 ans,
tête brûlée au passé chargé.
- Des armes ?
- Des fusils,
selon leur soeur.
Je veux la voir rapidement.
- Que demandent-ils ?
- Rien pour l'instant.
Quelle est votre théorie ?
C'est vous, le chef.
lls se sont limités
à l'aile où leur père
est hospitalisé.
lls en veulent à l'hôpital.
D'où vous sortez tout ça ?
Vous l'avez dit.
C'est moi, le chef.
Au boulot.
Je suis Jarod Jackson, du FBl.
Je veux parler de vos requêtes.
Si vous pensez à quelque chose,
c'est le moment d'en discuter.
C'est entre l'hôpital et nous.
Votre père est là.
Ainsi que des innocents
qui ont besoin de soins.
Personne ne veut de victimes.
Dites ce que vous voulez
et on pourra en terminer.
Notez.
41 342 dollars
et 1 7 cents. Pas un sou de plus,
pas un sou de moins.
Point final.
D'accord. Je vais voir
ce que je peux faire.
lnstallez
une ligne téléphonique directe.
Et s'ils répondent pas ?
lls ont pu tuer quelqu'un
sans qu'on le sache.
Je peux avoir
les plans du bâtiment ?
Dans 1 0 minutes.
ll me faut une caméra
à fibres optiques et un émetteur.
Doucement, Einstein.
Cette ville a deux feux rouges
et trois quincailleries.
Je peux vous trouver un marteau,
mais pour le réacteur nucléaire,
c'est raté.
Un magasin d'électronique ?
ça, on a.
Je vais faire une liste.
Trouvez-moi ça sans tarder.
On ne t'a pas suivie ?
Papa, tu as l'air...
Désolé de te faire peur.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Assieds-toi.
- Où étais-tu ?
- Planqué.
On ne me cherchera jamais ici.
Ecoute...
ll y a un coffre
au niveau souterrain 22,
derrière la manche à incendie.
Plein d'argent. Apporte-le-moi.
Ne dis rien. Question de vie
ou de mort. Tu comprends ?
Non.
Brigitte et moi,
on doit quitter notre cachette.
Mais pourquoi tu te caches ?
<i>Mauvaise nouvelle.</i>
Jarod ne s'est pas présenté
à son travail.
<i>On l'a raté.</i>
- Lyle ?
<i>- ll vous cherche.</i>
<i>Et il est en rogne.</i>
Sans blague !
Continuez à chercher Jarod.
<i>Je reviens dès que possible.</i>
ça va tourner au cauchemar.
Personne ne veut d'un western.
Vous êtes ?
Rebecca Simons, administratrice.
Dr Franklin, cardiologue.
lls ont parlé aux fils Larsen.
J'écoute.
Le père a été hospitalisé.
La famille a cru
à une crise cardiaque.
ll est allé aux urgences ?
J'ai diagnostiqué une arythmie.
C'est douloureux, mais pas mortel.
Ses fils ne semblent pas
de cet avis.
J'aurais dû garder M. Larsen
une nuit de plus.
Ce chiffre
vous dit quelque chose ?
41 342 dollars et 1 7 cents ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Bonne question.
Des patients risquent la mort
s'ils ne reçoivent
aucun traitement.
Sarah ? Je m'appelle Jarod.
L'homme au téléphone.
Je suis du FBl.
Pour vous comme pour moi,
c'est une surprise d'être ici.
Je sais que vous vivez
des moments durs.
Expliquez-moi.
Pourquoi vos frères font ça ?
Je veux régler ça
sans effusion de sang.
Mais je peux pas
retenir ces hommes indéfiniment.
ça a toujours été
la pagaille dans la famille.
Mais ça s'est gâté
après la mort de maman.
Surtout pour Cam.
Votre mère était ici ?
Dans la même chambre que papa.
Elle était au plus mal
à sa sortie
et elle est morte peu après.
Et là, votre père...
Mes frères ont peut-être tort.
Mais ils agissent
pour une bonne cause.
Je ne vous aiderai pas
à les tuer.
J'ai le matériel.
Voyons ça.
Tu vas faire quoi, Cam ?
Je réfléchis.
J'espère
que tu sais ce que tu fais.
Je comprends pas.
Parfois, ça aide
d'être une mouche sur un mur.
Ou dans ce cas,
dans le système d'aération.
Prenez les plans.
ça nous donne une idée de l'espace
où sont retenus les otages,
des fenêtres, des issues.
Nom d'un chien !
ça peut m'aider à faire feu.
J'ai des hommes
sur le toit d'à côté.
Vous devez penser
à la sécurité de tous.
Je dois sauver la vie des otages !
Si j'hésite
et qu'un innocent meurt,
c'est ma faute.
Je ne commettrai pas
cette erreur.
Le shérif a l'air un peu à cran.
ll a ses raisons.
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu fous, Cam ?</i>
<i>T'inquiète.</i>
<i>Tu ne ferais pas ça</i>
si ta mère était vivante.
Elle ne l'est pas, mais moi, si.
Arrête de parler. Repose-toi.
L'endroit est bourré
d'armes et d'insignes.
A quoi tu t'attendais ?
Une amende sur le pare-brise ?
<i>Continue à surveiller.</i>
<i>Le shérif ordonne de couper</i>
<i>la clim et la lumière.</i>
A terre !
Et maintenant ?
lci Jackson.
<i>Remettez la lumière et la clim !</i>
C'est d'accord,
en échange de quelques otages.
- Pourquoi je vous croirais ?
- Vous avez ma parole.
ll ne vous sera fait aucun mal
tant qu'on parlera.
<i>ll va faire très chaud.</i>
On est d'accord ?
Faites-moi confiance.
Parlez-moi.
Tout le monde à terre !
Cam me faisait confiance
et vous avez tout gâché !
Cam Larsen
n'est pas un type fiable.
ll a déclenché une émeute
en prison. Vous le saviez ?
Les gardiens
battaient les détenus.
Vous le saviez ?
J'ai Cam en ligne.
<i>ça va pas ?</i>
Je ne suis pour rien
dans la fusillade.
<i>ll faut qu'on se voie.</i>
Je suis là
pour sauver la vie de mon père.
Compris ?
<i>ll fait trop chaud.</i>
<i>La clim !</i>
Je vais la remettre en marche.
<i>Je peuX venir ?</i>
<i>Rien que vous.</i> S<i>ans arme.</i>
<i>1 0 minutes.</i>
D'accord.
1 0 minutes.
- Ce sont les gosses de Cam.
- Je les ai fait venir.
Pour le toucher aux tripes ?
Pour le toucher au coeur.
Où êtes-vous ?
Et Jarod ?
<i>Je suis tombé sur une prise</i>
<i>d'otages à fletcher Ridge,</i>
<i>dans un hôpital.</i>
<i>Le fBl est sur place.</i>
J'ai pensé
que ça intéresserait Jarod.
J'ai donc contacté le FBl
de Chicago.
lls sont pas sur le coup.
S<i>'il</i> y <i>avait des agents,</i>
ils viendraient de Chicago
et ils n'ont envoyé personne.
Préparez le jet.
Je viens dès que possible.
Et Lyle ?
Lyle qui ?
J'adore la glace.
Je veux aider votre père,
mais j'ai besoin de vous.
Hier soir,
papa a crié après Billy et Sarah.
ll était fâché ?
ll a dit que l'hôpital
laisserait mourir grand-père,
comme grand-mère.
ll les a traités d'assassins.
Tu as perdu une dent ?
Elle vient de tomber.
Tu la mettras sous ton oreiller
pour la petite souris ?
Ce soir.
Tu penses avoir combien ?
Peut-être un dollar.
Que dirais-tu...
de 5 dollars ?
C'est l'agent Jackson,
je ne suis pas armé.
Fouille-le.
C'est bon.
Quelqu'un aurait pu être tué.
C'était une erreur.
ça ne se reproduira pas.
<i>Ce ne sont pas</i>
<i>des tireurs d'élite.</i>
S<i>ans blague !</i>
Vous êtes prêt à en finir
pour qu'on soigne votre père ?
Je sais que vous tenez à lui.
Vous savez rien !
Pourquoi ne pas m'expliquer ?
41 342 dollars et 1 7 cents.
Drôle de prix pour une vie.
Ce n'est pas mon prix,
mais le leur.
Elle va mal.
Vous allez la laisser mourir ?
Sa vie
contre celle de votre père ?
- On devrait la libérer.
- Tais-toi !
Ne la tuez pas.
Si vous la laissez mourir,
vous finirez vos jours en prison.
Ainsi que Billy.
Pensez à vos enfants.
Mes enfants...
ils ne comprennent pas.
Votre fils vous ressemble.
- Vous lui avez parlé ?
- C'est la procédure.
ll m'a dit de vous donner ça.
Je lui laisse combien ?
L'argent de la petite souris.
C'est vrai, la petite souris.
Tu as un dollar ?
- Un billet de 5.
- Donne.
- 5 $ pour une dent de lait ?
- Donne.
Renoncez maintenant
et vous mettrez l'argent
sous son oreiller.
Je peux pas le laisser.
Vous ne comprenez pas, hein ?
ll ne s'agit pas que de lui,
mais de chaque malade qui mérite
d'être traité dignement.
lls vont le faire sortir.
ll a l'air guéri ?
Donnez-moi un otage.
Collaborez avec moi.
Dehors, des gens attendent
une raison de vous tuer,
vous et votre petit frère.
Prenez cette femme.
Aidez-le.
Faites-la sortir.
Et les autres ?
Un à la fois.
Un à la fois.
C'est bien, Cam.
Pour certains patients,
on risque la catastrophe.
Par la fenêtre, on peut
régler ça d'un coup de feu.
Les balles
sont la seule solution ?
Un coup.
Je voudrais vous parler.
Votre nom ?
Lindsay Tyler.
C'est pas beau
de se ronger les ongles.
Je sais.
Tu me reconnais pas ?
Je devrais ?
Cindy Perkins.
Bal du lycée Sadie Hawkins.
Je t'ai invité à danser,
tu as accepté.
Cheveux filasse,
appareil dentaire...
Tu m'as poursuivi
toute la soirée.
<i>ça fait combien ? 1 5 ans ?</i>
<i>Tu voulais entendre</i>
ta chanson préférée, Dream Weaver.
C'est une chanson géniale.
Mon père est mort
d'une maladie cardiaque.
Je suis devenue infirmière
pour ça.
Ton père me rappelle un peu
le mien.
Je suis désolé.
Je voulais pas...
Cam !
ll ne respire pas.
<i>ll me faut un médecin !</i>
J'en envoie un.
Allez-y.
Pardon ?
Ces hommes sont armés.
Sans protection,
je n'y vais pas.
Rallumez la pièce.
Qu'allez-vous faire ?
C'est l'agent Jackson !
Un médecin !
ll risque l'arrêt cardiaque !
Qu'il entre !
On n'est pas là
pour tuer notre père.
Entrez !
Et le médecin ?
<i>Aucun n'est libre.</i>
<i>Je m'en occupe.</i>
J'espère pour vous,
parce que s'il meurt,
vous aussi.
Pas de pouls depuis 1 5 secondes.
- Prête.
- Dégagez.
Rien. 25 secondes.
Parlez-lui.
ll faut qu'il se batte.
Parlez-lui de vous.
<i>Vite !</i>
<i>40 secondes.</i>
J'avais 5 ans
et tu m'emmenais chasser.
360 joules.
Parlez.
Tu me réveillais à l'aube.
Je détestais ça,
mais tu insistais.
Tu disais qu'un lever de soleil
dans les bois,
ça rapprochait de Dieu.
Tu t'en souviens ?
Une minute.
Allez, bats-toi.
Ne nous abandonne pas.
On a besoin de toi.
On réessaie.
<i>Bats-toi.</i>
<i>On a besoin de toi.</i>
<i>Cod</i>y <i>et kerr</i>y <i>aussi.</i>
On risque
des séquelles définitives.
Reste avec nous.
Ne meurs pas.
Le pouls revient !
lls sont drôlement bien formés
au FBl !
Voyons ça de plus près.
C'était quoi ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
On voit plus rien.
Vous avez fait le bon choix.
Donnez-moi un autre otage.
Cindy, rentre chez toi.
Je ne pars pas avant toi.
Pour mon père.
J'y vais.
ll faut retrouver l'image.
On a le son.
C'est quoi, ça ?
Vous nous surveilliez !
Je devrais vous buter !
<i>Vous êtes pas fiable !</i>
Pas comme ça.
Emmenez-la.
Plus question de discuter !
Dehors !
ça va ?
Occupez-vous d'elle.
Vous êtes fou ?
- C'était un accident.
- On aurait pu mourir.
Faut arrêter de les harceler !
J'en ai ras le bol de vous.
C'est-à-dire ?
C'est vous, le chef.
Vous devriez comprendre.
Trouvez le numéro du FBl
à Chicago.
Vous ne trouverez pas Mlle Parker
en fouillant son bureau.
On l'a vue ce matin.
Elle avait des courses à faire.
Elle n'a pas dit où elle allait ?
Vous la connaissez.
Elle n'en fait qu'à sa tête.
J'ai remarqué.
Vous ne me mentiriez pas ?
Quelqu'un
a vu le match ce week-end ?
- ça va durer longtemps ?
- Aucune idée.
Votre façon d'agir
est impressionnante.
Je n'avais guère le choix,
pas vrai ?
Dites-moi une chose.
Comment procèdent les assurances
avec l'hôpital ?
En pleine prise d'otages,
vous parlez de facturation ?
Je suis curieux.
Et les mutuelles ?
Tout dépend de l'avis du médecin.
Une procédure médicale
est approuvée ou non
selon votre recommandation ?
Et celle de l'administrateur.
Rebecca Simons.
Pour cet hôpital, oui.
Quel est
le pourcentage
d'interventions refusées ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Lancez-vous.
50% ?
68%.
1 1 % de plus
que la moyenne nationale.
Pourquoi, docteur ?
Les gens sont peut-être
en bonne santé ici.
Peut-être.
ll faut qu'on parle.
Tu as une sale mine.
C'est comme ça
quand on va mourir.
Tu t'es mis dans un sacré pétrin.
Comme toujours dans ma vie.
J'ai pas dû faire ce qu'il fallait
quand tu étais petit.
J'ai improvisé au fur et à mesure.
Mais je vous ai appris
à distinguer le bien du mal.
ça, oui.
Je veux te sauver.
On forme une famille.
J'ai jamais connu mon père.
Rien qu'une tape sur la tête
de temps en temps.
J'ai seulement fait de mon mieux.
Quand votre mère est morte...
quelque chose en moi
est parti avec elle.
On lutte contre la même douleur.
Elle me manque... chaque jour.
A moi aussi, papa.
41 342 dollars et 1 7 cents.
C'est ce que facture l'hôpital
pour un pontage.
Comment ?
Jake Larsen a un niveau élevé
de créatine dans le sang.
Et alors ?
Le manque d'oxygène
bleuit ses doigts.
Je ne suis toujours pas.
ll risque
une grave crise cardiaque.
Sa seule chance de survivre,
c'est le pontage.
L'hôpital lui a refusé
cette intervention.
Vous êtes qui ?
J'ai appelé le FBl. Personne
ne connaît l'agent Jackson.
C'est un service immense.
Vous avez eu
la mauvaise personne.
Si ces gens meurent,
vous serez coupable.
Vous aurez du sang sur les mains.
Je sais ce que c'est.
Et vous aussi.
Votre adjoint m'a raconté
la prise d'otages de l'an dernier.
Vous avez attiré le coupable
sur le seuil
et vous avez hésité à le tuer.
ll vous a aussi dit que le type
avait abattu un jeune de 1 5 ans ?
ll a décrit la nausée
que j'ai quand je croise
ses parents ?
Vous avez fait
ce qui vous semblait juste.
Et un innocent
y a laissé sa peau.
Voilà le sang
que j'ai sur les mains...
agent Jackson.
La journée a été longue, hein ?
On peut parler un peu ?
Je suis en retard.
Une autre fois.
Je suis au courant
pour la maladie de Jake Larsen.
Quel intérêt peut avoir
une mutuelle
à étouffer cette affaire ?
J'ai vu votre dispute
avec le Dr Franklin.
Je sais ce qui se passe.
On peut en parler ici
ou devant les caméras télé.
A vous de voir.
C'était rien que pour l'argent...
ou c'était personnel ?
Je vous ai vue
avec le Dr Franklin.
Mes copines et moi,
on rêvait
de rencontrer un médecin
avec qui on vivrait
le grand amour.
Je voulais que ça soit comme ça
pour Steven et moi.
Vous avez signé
les bons de sortie des patients.
Mes décisions s'appuient
sur celles du Dr Franklin.
Une fois, j'ai fermé les yeux.
Et de fil en aiguille...
Rien que pour l'argent !
Franklin touchait
des pots-de-vin des mutuelles.
En refusant des interventions
à certains patients,
il fait faire des économies
aux mutuelles.
Et touche un pourcentage.
Je vous jure
que je n'étais pas au courant
pour Jake Larsen.
Franklin a menacé de me dénoncer
si je parlais et...
j'ai eu peur.
Moins que ceux qu'on a renvoyés
chez eux pour mourir.
La clé ne marche pas.
Vraiment ?
J'ai dû te donner la mauvaise.
Essayons celle-ci.
ça marche.
Désolé de te mêler à ça,
mon ange.
Bébé Parker.
- Quoi ?
- C'est rien.
- Un dossier médical ?
- C'est du passé.
- Le mien ou celui de Lyle ?
- Peu importe.
Quand j'aurai le temps,
je t'expliquerai tout.
J'ai besoin de ton arme.
Ta tête est mise à prix !
Oui, et ces salauds
se rapprochent.
Qui a ordonné ça ?
Je ne sais pas.
ça...
c'est tout ce qui compte.
Le futur de notre famille.
L'héritier du nom des Parker.
ll grandit
dans le ventre de Brigitte.
Le bébé sera bientôt là.
Comment t'aider ?
Jarod demeure la clé.
Ramène-le
et tout redeviendra comme avant.
J'arrive.
<i>lntervention refusée</i>

Non, je vais...
Je sais quels sont

C'est toujours dangereux.
Je ne peux pas

- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Je suis blessé !
Les Larsen !
lls sont fous ! lls arrivent !
lls disent savoir
qui veut tuer leur père !
J'étouffe.
Mon coeur...
Qu'est-ce qui m'arrive ?
Ce qui est arrivé à Jake Larsen.
Vous avez une crise cardiaque.
Qu'est-ce que vous m'avez fait ?
J'ai enduit votre clavier
d'un antidépresseur tricyclique.
ll passe par la peau
et accélère le rythme cardiaque.
J'ai prétendu être blessé
et poursuivi par les frères Larsen
car l'adrénaline augmente
les effets de la substance.
Pourquoi ?
A cause des substances
administrées à Jake Larsen
pour masquer
les symptômes de sa maladie.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Tout le monde.
Personne.
Avouez
et je guéris votre coeur.
On est tous du même côté.
N'en faisons pas un problème.
Si, car vous vous êtes allié
à une mutuelle
qui pensait plus au profit
qu'aux patients.
Larsen n'aurait guère vécu
plus longtemps.
Qu'importe !
Un médecin
a le devoir de soigner !
La cyanose s'installe.
ll faut vous soigner,
sinon vous risquez de mourir.
Combien de gens sont morts pour que
vous vous remplissiez les poches ?
Oui, j'ai touché des pots-de-vin
pour renvoyer les patients
chez eux ! Aidez-moi !
Désolé, docteur.
Votre demande est refusée.
ll va mourir ?
J'ai utilisé de la thyroxine.
ll n'a que des brûlures
d'estomac.
Et il perdra le contrôle
de sa vessie pendant 2 jours.
Je vais laisser le juge
s'occuper des frères Larsen.
Vu la situation,
cette famille a assez souffert.
Vous avez raison.
Merci de m'avoir évité
de faire une bêtise.
Les erreurs du passé
ne doivent pas gâcher l'avenir.
Excusez-moi, shérif.
FBl de Chicago ?
Vous êtes journaliste ?
Blue Cove Gazette.
Vous avez suivi l'affaire ?
Non, je viens d'arriver.
ll y avait un négociateur.
ll paraît
que c'était un imposteur.
ll semblerait.
Où est-il ?
J'ignore comment il a fait,
mais selon les témoins,
il était compétent.
On l'a raté par ta faute.
<i>Ne dis rien.</i>
<i>Quand j'aurai le temps,</i>
<i>je t'eXpliquerai tout.</i>
<i>Jarod demeure la clé.</i>
<i>Ramène-le</i>

Tu seras tenue

Vous avez laissé l'adresse ?
Mlle Parker nous rejoindra ici.
Elle déteste qu'on la précède
dans un repaire de Jarod.
ça ne colle pas.
- ll y a quelque chose.
- Remontez à un an...
Thomas ?
Aujourd'hui ? ll y a un an que
Thomas a été assassiné chez elle.
Que je suis bête !
J'ai fait comme si
c'était un jour normal.
C'est un jour normal.
Même clown...
différent spectacle.
Je suis désolé.
Merci.
Que mijote Jarod le farceur ?
On n'a fait que gratter la surface.
Si vous voulez creuser...
Passez tout au crible.
Si on ne trouve rien,
on donnera tout ça à un cirque.
On a trouvé une chose.
Un clown local,
Marco le Magnifique,
arrêté pour attentat à la pudeur.
La police l'a trouvé
dans la cage d'un lion,
un steak cru attaché au...
Tout est là.
Mesdames, Messieurs,
les enfants, voici...
Jarod le dompteur !
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Le modèle réduit, vu par Jarod,
de ma rencontre avec Thomas.
Enfoiré !
Jarod ne pensait pas à mal.
C'est ça.
Et O.J. faisait juste joujou.
- Je dis juste...
- C'est assez grave
qu'il sache comment
j'ai rencontré Thomas,
mais qu'il me laisse ça
aujourd'hui n'est pas un hasard.
Pour une fois,
avouez qu'il me torture
pour le plaisir.
Et où qu'il soit,
je sais qu'il rit.
Je suis loin de rire.
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>à cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>ll défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Aux maisons
habilement transformées en foyers.
Aux coeurs vacants
à nouveau comblés.
Aux commencements
qui auraient pu être.
Tous perdus avec toi, mon amour.
Belles paroles.
Pas de confettis,
ni de farces et attrapes ?
ll n'y a pas de quoi rire.
Tu as bien choisi ton moment,
aujourd'hui.
Je suis tentée de te trouer la peau
et de recommencer ma vie
sur de nouvelles bases.
Ton arme ne tirera pas.
J'ai ôté le percuteur cette nuit.
Je le mets sous mon oreiller.
Et tu baves du côté gauche.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ici ?
ll faut boucler
certaines affaires.
Trouver qui a tué
celui que tu aimais et pourquoi.
Et rendre hommage
à Thomas Gates
car il le mérite.
Ce n'est pas parce que tu es
un génie que tu sais
ce qu'il mérite.
Pourquoi tu me tourmentes,
qu'est-ce que...
ça peut te faire ?
''Rumeur 58259.''
Un code du Centre.
''Rumeur'' désignerait
le chargé de mission.
Quant au numéro, je demanderai
à Manny, le muet du standard.
Celui qui n'a pas de langue ?
Ce serait idiot d'embrasser
un type comme ça...
Pour une femme.
A vue de nez,
il s'agit d'un code
pour un dossier
d'écoute téléphonique.
Demandez lequel à Manny.
Dans les circonstances actuelles,
ce sera difficile.
Pourquoi ?
Vous n'êtes pas au courant ?
Matumbo est mort.
Le vilain sorcier est...
Mort.
Le Zoulou du Triumvirat
a été assassiné.
- 2 balles dans le coeur.
- Petite cible.
Et l'assassin lui a également
arraché les yeux.
Comme s'il en avait trop vu.
A propos, quand avez-vous vu
votre père pour la dernière fois ?
Quand vous a-t-on pris le pouls
pour la dernière fois ?
Allons...
Je vous le demandais
car rien n'est plus important
que la famille. Ma famille.
Votre famille.
La famille du Centre.
Tu peux traduire
Barney le dinosaure ?
L'arme qui a tué Matumbo vient
du plus haut niveau du Centre.
Un niveau qui comprend
vous, M. Lyle
et ce cher papa,
qui a le plus à gagner
de la disparition de Matumbo.
Mon père l'aurait tué ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Quand ceux qu'on aime
nous manquent
et qu'il faut survivre,
on est capables de tout.
<i>Parle-moi, Par</i>k<i>er.</i>
<i>Quelque chose te tracasse.</i>
<i>ça va.</i>
<i>Rien ne presse.</i>
La recherche de votre père
intensifie mon autorité.
Nous le trouverons.
A ce moment-là, ses alliés
seront une espèce menacée.
ll t'accuse autant que moi
de participer à un coup.
Fais au moins semblant d'écouter.
Appelle-moi, quand tu seras
revenue parmi les vivants.
Vous croyez aux fantômes, Syd ?
Je crois à l'au-delà,
aux secondes chances.
Je parle de Thomas.
Sa présence m'enveloppe.
J'entends parfois
ma mère me consoler tout bas,
le rire de mon père.
Ceux que l'on aime
sont toujours avec nous,
vivants ou morts.
C'est plus que ça.
Je le vois...
Je le touche presque.
L'anniversaire de sa mort,
la disparition de votre père
et l'assassinat de Matumbo...
Sous pression,
l'esprit est capable
de bien des choses.
Ce n'est pas mon esprit.
C'est Thomas.
ll est ici avec moi...
comme s'il attendait.
Peut-être...
qu'il veut vous donner
une 2e chance
de terminer
une chose inachevée.
Papa, tu vas bien ?
A merveille, depuis que Matumbo...
Si je l'ai tué ?
Je lui aurais arraché
plus que les yeux.
Tu es recherché. Cox...
Je prépare mon retour.
ll ne manque plus qu'une pièce.
Tu as l'air changé.
Et comment !
Je vais être père.
Je n'avais pas ressenti ça
depuis toi.
<i>- ll faut qu'on se voie.</i>
- Où ?
<i>Je ne sais pas encore.</i>
<i>Reste sur tes gardes.</i>
Cette agitation
est presque finie.
<i>Les survivants</i>
<i>seront bientôt réunis.</i>
Les survivants...
Comme Manny me l'a dit...
Vous avez discuté avec un muet
sans langue ?
Pas avec des mots.
La ligne mise sur écoute
était celle de Thomas.
Les appels étaient transmis
à Rumeur.
J'ignore encore qui c'est,
mais j'ai déchiffré
une partie des appels
et je les ai copiés.
Allez-y.
<i>Je pars en wee</i>k<i>-end</i>
<i>avec Par</i>k<i>er.</i>
<i>On s'appelle après, vieuX.</i>
<i>Prends soin de toi, Jarod.</i>
Tommy et Jarod... étaient amis ?
Parle-moi.
Tommy ?
J'ai failli accoucher.
Tu vas bien ?
Tu sembles avoir vu
un fantôme.
J'en ai vu un.
Je suis heureuse
que tu ailles bien.
Je vais bien.
C'est Brigitte qui m'inquiète.
Porter la vie,
c'est un sacré défi.
Comment vous êtes arrivés ?
En stop. Tu m'avais donné
la clé de derrière.
- Ah bon ?
- J'ai besoin d'un service.
Dis-moi.
Je veux vous aider.
Tous les deux.
Tant mieux.
J'ai besoin de ta voiture.
ll a trouvé un endroit sûr.
On doit se dépêcher.
Et un médecin
pour l'accouchement.
Dis-moi où vous allez.
J'ai besoin de participer
à quelque chose de positif.
lmpossible. Trop risqué.
Matumbo est mort,
pas l'ordre de nous tuer.
Je crois que le tueur
n'est pas loin.
Je soupçonne Cox.
En tout cas, c'est un pro.
Fais comme si de rien n'était.
Ce ne sera pas long.
Plus qu'une pièce et je reprends
le commandement.
Je peux te la fournir.
Non, tu ne peux pas.
Je l'aurai bientôt.
Donne-moi les clés
de la voiture.
Prenez soin de mon frère
ou de ma soeur.
Promis.
Allons-y.
Qu'est-ce que ''Rumeur 58259'' ?
Aucune idée.
''Rumeur'' est le code
du responsable
d'une mise sur écoute.
Tu vois ?
ll faut s'entraider.
Rappelle-toi :
comme si de rien n'était.
<i>Rappelle-toi :</i>
<i>comme si de rien n'était.</i>
<i>''Rumeur''est le code</i>
<i>du responsable...</i>
<i>Parle-moi, Par</i>k<i>er.</i>
<i>Tu dois trouver qui a tué</i>
<i>celui que tu aimais.</i>
Tu n'es pas sur écoute ?
ça ne t'a pas empêché
d'être ami avec Tommy.
Tu en sais un peu plus
sur ''Rumeur''.
Je commence à peine,
alors fais-moi gagner du temps
<i>et dis-moi</i>
qui l'a tué.
J'en sais rien.
Ecoute-moi.
<i>Les règles qu'on a suivies</i>
<i>jusqu'à présent,</i>
ma loyauté envers
cette maison des horreurs,
<i>tes recherches familiales...</i>
On oublie tout ça
quand il s'agit de Thomas.
ll n'est pas un jeu !
Je n'en ferais jamais un jeu.
Mon but n'était pas
de vous tromper.
Ton but ? Quel but ?
L'amour.
Vous réunir a été
une de mes plus belles réussites.
<i>Nous réunir ?</i>
Tu mens !
On s'est rencontrés par hasard
dans une station-service...
Tu ne l'as pas connu après moi ?
Tu l'as connu avant ?
<i>Je ne suis pour rien</i>
<i>dans vos sentiments.</i>
Je n'ai fait
qu'allumer la flamme.
Tu es là ?
Parle-moi du Tommy
que tu as connu.
<i>Je l'ai connu un mois</i>
<i>avant toi.</i>
<i>Je travaillais pour</i>
<i>un de ses concurrents.</i>
Un promoteur dont l'avidité
a coûté 2 jambes à un garçon.
Tommy t'a aidé
à le coincer.
Thomas était épris de justice.
ll faut que je sache
qui l'a tué, Jarod.
Dès que j'ai du nouveau,
je t'appelle.
En attendant,
je crois que ''Rumeur''
<i>a assassiné Thomas.</i>
S<i>uis cette piste.</i>
<i>Et sois prudente.</i>
La rumeur peut tuer.
<i>ll est temps d'avoir confiance.</i>
<i>fais confiance à Jarod.</i>
C'est drôle :
bureau de vote du Centre.
Tirez la chasse
pour élire le plus détesté.
Un coup : M. Lyle.
Deux coups : M. Raines.
Trois coups : M. Cox.
C'est à n'importe qui.
Je suis flatté.
Mais je n'aimerais pas
compter les voix.
Et vous, M. Broots ?
ll y a des rumeurs...
Des rumeurs ?
Vous vous lavez les mains,
j'espère.
Toujours. Avant et après.
Quel genre de rumeurs ?
Ces sèche-mains me rappellent
la morgue de mon père.
Nous employions
des techniques similaires.
ll me laissait l'aider
après l'école.
Si j'étais sage.
Même les morts
doivent être propres.
En effet, car...
la propreté est la vérité.
Vous croyez à la vérité,
M. Broots ?
A propos de cette rumeur,
je peux expliquer...
La propreté est la vérité.
ça brûle un peu.
Comme le crématorium.
Quelles rumeurs entendez-vous ?
Dieu que c'est bon !
Qu'avez-vous dit à Cox ?
J'ai hurlé que ma main brûlait.
A propos de ''Rumeur''.
En fait,
M. Cox se fichait de ''Rumeur''.
ll revenait toujours à votre père.
Cet intérêt pour votre père
indique une chose.
Que Cox a été engagé
par Matumbo pour tuer papa.
Et peut-être Brigitte
et le bébé.
Je manque de temps.
Papa aussi.
Rien d'autre sur ''Rumeur'' ?
J'ai remonté la source
de la mise sur écoute.
Et ?
Un message indique que l'identité
de ''Rumeur'' est dans un dossier.
Trouvons-le.
J'y travaille, mais il s'agit
d'un dossier Z-3.
Z-3 ?
ça désigne des contrats
de mise à mort.
ça se tient. Thomas a été tué
par quelqu'un du Centre.
Merci pour votre voiture.
Pas de problème.
Je peux rester
vous tenir compagnie ?
Merci, mais je ne me sens
pas seule.
ça doit être dur, encore.
Pourquoi faut-il que les gens
meurent pour qu'on pense
à tout ce qu'on ne leur a pas dit ?
Parce qu'on traite la vie
comme un insecte sur le trottoir.
On ne voit qu'un insecte,
pas un miracle.
Et malgré nos efforts,
on finit en général par l'écraser,
au lieu de la prendre en main.
Et les vivants
héritent des affaires inachevées.
Jusqu'à ce qu'on les termine.
Entre Thomas
et ce qui est arrivé à votre père,
je veux que vous sachiez
que je suis là,
si vous avez besoin de quelqu'un.
D'un ami.
Le dossier ''Rumeur Z-3'' ?
- Comment il est arrivé là ?
- Peu importe.
L'important,
c'est le nom de l'assassin.
Qui ?
La vengeance ? Réfléchissez.
A quoi ? Tommy a été assassiné
et l'assassin va payer.
C'est réfléchi.
Dieu nous garde.
S<i>ois prudente, Par</i>k<i>er.</i>
Ouvrez, Brigitte !
- ll est 4 h.
- Où est Brigitte ?
Où est-elle passée ?
N'essaie pas de la couvrir.
Où est-elle ?
Elle était ici
quand je me suis endormi.
On a dû quitter
notre cachette.
Comment tu nous as trouvés ?
La voiture émet un signal.
Elle est bizarre, depuis peu.
Elle disparaît des heures.
Elle est peut-être
en train d'accoucher !
Que fais-tu ici ?
Thomas.
''Rumeur 58259''.
Brigitte est ''Rumeur''.
- Tu n'en savais rien ?
- Non !
Elle a dû suivre
les ordres de Matumbo.
Elle a tué Thomas.
Désolé.
Elle porte mon enfant.
Réfléchis. Où est-elle allée ?
Matumbo mort, elle est en danger.
On a tous un refuge.
ll y avait un endroit,
à la campagne.
J'ignore où c'est,
mais elle avait un double de la clé
dans son bureau.
Je la trouverai.
Et que feras-tu ?
Pense à mon bébé !
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Je cherche.
Pourquoi ?
Tu n'es pas la seule.
Cox recherche papa
plus que jamais.
S'il le relie à la mort de Matumbo,
Parker sera pas un nom en vogue.
Ton cher Cox
s'est retourné contre toi ?
Je te le répète,
je n'ai aucun lien avec Cox.
J'évite d'être dans son collimateur
et je te conseille de m'imiter.
- M. Cox et les nettoyeurs...
- Je sais.
Trouvez-moi quelque chose.
Une clé.
Un truc en métal
dont les gens évolués
se servent
pour ouvrir des portes.
Dans le bureau de Brigitte.
C'était tes yeux.
<i>Quoi ?</i>
Où Thomas se sentait chez lui.
- ll te l'a dit ?
- Oui.
Tu crois qu'il savait
ce que je faisais ?
J'en sais rien.
ll savait qui tu étais.
Pour lui, tu étais l'amour.
<i>ll avait découvert ce sentiment</i>
<i>en regardant dans tes</i> y<i>euX.</i>
Tant de fois,
j'ai voulu lui parler...
lui dire, mais...
Lui dire quoi ?
C'est trop tard, maintenant.
C'est important de finir
des affaires inachevées.
T'inquiète.
Brigitte le saura assez vite.
<i>C'est Brigitte qui a tiré ?</i>
Tu n'as pas lu
le dossier que tu m'as laissé ?
Je ne t'ai laissé aucun dossier.
<i>Amour ou vengeance,</i>
ne laisse pas l'inachevé
t'achever.
Vous l'avez trouvée ?
Et ce qu'elle ouvre.
Si Brigitte interceptait
les appels de Thomas, elle devait
les transférer quelque part.
Manny me devait un service
car je lui avais prêté mon karaoké.
Au fait, Broots.
Les appels étaient transférés
dans un chalet à 30 km d'ici.
Voici l'adresse.
Je compte sur vous
pour dire à Manny...
Je vous attendais.
Je vais accoucher.
J'ai entendu une rumeur
sur vous.
C'est vrai.
Tirez si vous voulez.
Dieu sait que je le mérite.
Vous n'avez pas idée.
Je n'ai qu'une question.
Pourquoi avez-vous tué Tommy ?
Les ordres.
Les ordres de qui ?
Dites-moi qui !
Vos contractions sont espacées ?
Disons que vous serez
bientôt soeur.
Tuez-moi si vous voulez,
mais épargnez mon bébé.
Vous avez le don de l'évidence.
ça n'a plus d'importance.
Ce bébé vous vengera.
Le bébé ?
J'ai un problème
au niveau du placenta.
Je mourrai d'une hémorragie
en accouchant.
J'appelle des secours.
On ne capte pas, ici.
Tenez bon !
ça a coupé
quand j'ai eu votre père.
Vous lui avez parlé ?
ll a dit qu'il venait
avec un médecin.
Pourquoi avoir fui ?
Vous alliez découvrir la vérité
sur ''Rumeur''
et avec le tueur de Matumbo
à nos trousses, j'ai fui
pour protéger votre père.
Pensez de moi ce que vous voulez,
je l'aime beaucoup.
Merci.
Merci de ne pas me laisser seule.
<i>Hors service</i>
On fait des heures sup ?
Je suis salarié.
Comme votre ami Manny,
sans langue ?
Le pauvre bave
quand il parle.
ll parle ?
De vous, M. Broots.
Dites-moi où Brigitte est allée.
Si vous refusez cette chance,
vous aurez plus de points communs
avec Manny
que le karaoké.
Vous voulez un feu de joie ?
Restez avec moi.
Je suis là.
Je suis désolée...
pour Thomas.
Pour tout le mal
que je vous ai fait.
Vous ne m'avez pas répondu.
J'ignore de qui ça venait,
mais pas du Triumvirat.
ça venait du Centre.
lls vous trouvaient déconcentrée.
ll se passe quelque chose
là-dedans !
Où sont papa et le médecin ?
Restez avec moi.
Je vais m'évanouir.
Non ! Je vois sa tête.
ll faut pousser.
- La tête est bleue.
- Je ne peux pas.
Vous pouvez. Poussez !
Le bébé manque d'oxygène.
Poussez !
Je vais mal ?
ll y a beaucoup de sang.
- Je ne tiendrai pas.
- Mais si !
Je suis venue vous tuer
et c'est moi
qui décide si vous mourez
ou non !
Poussez !
Tenez bon. Les secours arrivent.
J'arrive trop tard
pour le tableau.
Mais à temps pour mourir.
ll est avec nous.
Le Dr Cox vient pour le bébé.
Obstétrique, Harvard 1 993.
Voilà qui boucle la boucle.
La dernière pièce.
Faites sa toilette.
Que se passe-t-il ?
M. Cox est mon agent
depuis des mois.
ll préparait mon retour.
Tu n'as qu'une raison
d'être ici.
Elle a avoué, pour ''Rumeur'' ?
Une chance que ce dossier
soit apparu.
Elle est morte.
- Tu l'as...
- Tuée ? Non.
Elle est morte en couches.
Tu n'éprouves rien
pour ta femme ?
Jusqu'à ce que la mort
nous sépare.
Elle n'a servi qu'à porter le bébé,
ton héritier ?
C'est toi qui as laissé
le dossier chez moi ?
Pourquoi ?
Laisse-moi deviner.
L'arme qui a tué Matumbo,
trouvée sur elle,
ça blanchit tout le monde.
Elle l'avait mise
dans mes affaires.
''Rumeur'' nous visait tous les deux,
mais ils sauront
qu'on n'abat pas un Parker.
Faites tout disparaître.
Tu ne veux pas savoir ?
Savoir quoi ?
Si c'est un garçon ou une fille.
Je pensais que venger Thomas
m'apaiserait,
mais même si je l'avais fait,
ça n'aurait rien changé.
<i>Ce n'était pas ça,</i>
<i>l'affaire inachevée.</i>
Tu disais
que tu aurais voulu lui dire.
Lui dire quoi ?
Je ne lui ai jamais dit
''je t'aime''.
Et ton coeur et ta tête
se livrent bataille.
Je donnerais tout
pour une minute avec lui.
Pour lui dire ces mots.
Dis-lui.
Que ton coeur gagne la bataille.
Je t'aime, Tommy.
<i>Je t'aime aussi, Par</i>k<i>er.</i>

<i>Après 3 ans et demi à ce poste,</i>

<i>Cette question</i>

<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>

<i>Du nouveau sur le suicide</i>

<i>Les réponses</i>

Agent Holder ?
Agent Wilkes.
Le comportementaliste !
- J'arrive à peine.
- Vous n'avez pas dû déjeuner.
Vous avez faim ?
''Potage instantané'' ?
L'idée est astucieuse !
Vous venez de Seattle
ou de Mars ?
Entre les deux.
Le patron vous attend.
Talbot s'occupe
de l'affaire Baxter.
Vous connaissiez Todd ?
ça m'étonne de lui.
Moi aussi.
- Ellis Talbot.
- Enchanté.
J'ai besoin d'un homme comme vous.
Suivez-moi.
La femme de chambre
a appelé la police.
Le FBl couvre l'affaire.
On examine le corps de Baxter.
ll a passé une semaine
dans le Potomac.
ll ne voulait pas
être dérangé. Le personnel
ne s'est donc pas inquiété.
Le soir où Todd est arrivé ici,
des témoins l'ont vu
avec une copine.
lls sont montés
pour un peu de sexe
et beaucoup d'héroïne.
La fille a été interrogée ?
On la cherche. Mais elle serait
partie avant que Todd ne déjante.
Et saute.
Parfois, je me demande
si je connaissais vraiment Todd.
<i>Vous descendez ici ?</i>
<i>C'est parfait.</i>
<i>Votre voiture</i>
<i>n'est pas en panne, hein ?</i>
<i>Pourquoi m'aider ?</i>
<i>Vous m'inspirez confiance.</i>
<i>Attendez.</i>
<i>- Tenez.</i>
<i>- Pas question.</i>
<i>Vous m'avez assez aidé.</i>
<i>Laissez tomber</i>
<i>et pa</i>y<i>ez-vous une glace.</i>
<i>Une glace ?</i>
<i>C'est bon ?</i>
<i>C'est très bon.</i>
S<i>i jamais vous passez</i>
<i>par Washington...</i>
<i>appelez-moi.</i>
<i>Entendu.</i>
<i>Merci.</i>
Collaborez avec le FBl
mais consultez-moi.
Que me cachez-vous ?
La théorie du FBl
penche pour l'homicide.
Le suicide de Baxter est déjà
assez gênant comme ça.
C'est vous, l'expert.
Découvrez la vérité
sur les problèmes de Todd.
Chacun de nous veut la vérité.
Agent Holder.
Voici l'agent Jarod Wilkes.
Bailey Malone, VCTF.
La crème du FBl !
Voici le rapport de l'autopsie.
Planchez dessus.
J'ai appris.
Le bébé est seulement
en observation.
Ton petit frère va s'en tirer.
Tu as aidé à sa naissance
et à ma réhabilitation ici.
Je n'ai jamais été
aussi fier de toi.
Je connais ce regard !
Jarod t'a menti ?
Ce n'est pas Jarod.
C'est moi.
Je ne sais pas trop...
Tant de choses se sont passées.
La mort de Brigitte,
ton retour,
la naissance du bébé.
Je comprends.
Tu veux que ça change.
Ecoute. Approche.
Ne renonce jamais
à attraper Jarod.
Le bébé est l'avenir
de la famille.
Jarod est l'avenir du Centre.
Pourquoi ?
C'est notre meilleur atout.
Mais considère que ta vie
a officiellement changé.
C'est un jour nouveau.
Mes tentatives
de pollinisation ont réussi.
Mensonges !
Sales mensonges !
- L'autopsie est finie ?
- Tout est là.
Malone pense qu'il s'agit
de la signature d'un tueur.
Leur profiler a une théorie.
C'est moi.
Déçu ?
Je m'attendais à quelqu'un d'autre.
- Jarod Wilkes.
- Rachel Burke.
Ted Holder.
Votre théorie n'est pas
un peu présomptueuse ?
C'est une théorie.
- On a des preuves.
- Par exemple ?
Notre autopsie.
Todd Baxter
est mort par strangulation.
Sûrement une corde de piano.
On a trouvé ça.
Ligature.
Aux poignets.
ça ne colle pas vraiment
avec un suicide.
Signes de drogue
et de rapports sexuels.
Peut-être le fantasme
d'être attaché,
voire asphyxié.
Ou bien on l'a attaché.
Votre tueur à signature ?
Ce n'est que...
Une intuition.
Si on veut.
On a retrouvé la copine de Todd,
Emily Sadler.
J'aimerais l'interroger.
Je vous tiens au courant.
J'y compte bien.
J'ai connu Todd à Columbia.
J'étudiais le journalisme
et lui, la criminologie.
Todd était vraiment
quelqu'un de bien.
Mais il avait ses démons.
Quel genre ?
Du genre tenace.
Et cette ville n'arrangeait rien.
ll était dans un sale état,
ce soir-là.
ll se droguait ?
ça l'obsédait.
Vous l'aidiez ?
A votre avis ?
Je suis montée dans sa chambre
pour l'aider.
Mais il a pris de la drogue
et s'est mis à boire.
On s'est disputés,
je suis partie.
Vous l'avez... abandonné.
C'est mon démon.
Selon vous,
Todd Baxter était capable
de sauter de ce balcon ?
ll allait toujours trop loin,
il était comme ça.
A moins que vous en sachiez
plus que moi.
Ce n'est pas normal.
Sydney n'aurait jamais fait ça,
c'est une thérapie pour lui.
S<i>ales mensonges !</i>
Un vrai savant fou.
L'influence du Centre.
Revenez en arrière,
avant qu'il ne craque.
Angelo ! Zoom
et arrêt sur image.
Une montre dans un sac du Centre.
Angelo a dû
la sortir des archives.
ll devait savoir l'effet
que ça aurait sur Syd.
Je déteste le voir comme ça.
Combien de fois
Sydney m'a aidée ?
ll aurait dû m'appeler.
Vous avez 48 h
pour trouver la vérité.
Si le FBl aime les théories,
c'est son affaire.
Mais je refuse que mon service
perde son temps avec Baxter.
C'est un des nôtres.
La question n'est pas là.
ça nous fait
de la mauvaise publicité.
Vous pensez que le FBl ment ?
Je pense que Baxter mentait.
C'est un dealer qui l'a tué.
On découvre trop tard qu'il avait
un million de sales manies.
Un million plus une.
Jerry Linden,
service communications.
Agent Wilkes.
Jerry s'occupe de la presse.
N'ébruitez pas ça.
C'est mauvais.
Baxter a été arrêté à la fac
pour trafic d'héroïne.
Laissons tomber l'affaire.
On dirait le FBl !
Vous avez 48 h.
Puis vous partez.
Je peux prendre ça ?
Mieux vaut que ça ne traîne pas.
Suivez-moi.
A Seattle, les déchiqueteuses
sont petites.
Nos secrets sont gros.
Si vous voyiez
la taille des poubelles !
C'est une idée de Talbot ?
Asseyez-vous.
Une chose sur Talbot.
Vous savez, ces scouts qui suivent
la limousine du Président ?
ça a été sa vie pendant 25 ans.
Todd Baxter aurait fait pareil.
Dites-moi,
s'ils étaient si proches,
pourquoi a-t-elle quitté l'hôtel ?
Je l'ignore.
ll se droguait.
Parfois, on n'a pas le choix.
ça va ?
Je savais
qu'il y avait des agressions.
Heureusement, vous allez bien.
Merci.
Ce n'était pas une agression,
vous le savez.
Pourquoi avoir laissé Todd
à l'hôtel ?
C'était mon ami. Hélas,
il ne s'en rendait pas compte.
On l'a tué et quelqu'un essaie
de détruire sa réputation.
Vous ne le souhaitez pas.
Pourquoi mentir ?
Je voulais changer les choses.
Vous parlez comme Todd.
Vous le connaissiez ?
ll m'a sauvé la vie, une fois.
ll me manque tellement !
Aidez-moi.
Aidez-moi à protéger sa mémoire.
Todd avait rendez-vous à l'hôtel.
Mais il m'aidait
pour un problème de boulot.
Todd était comme ça.
On a dîné, puis je suis partie.
J'étais sans nouvelles de lui
quand j'ai vu les infos.
On avait trouvé son corps.
Un homme m'a appelée.
ll sait où j'habite,
où je promène mon chien.
Tout.
ll vous a fait mentir.
ll avait tout prévu,
c'était effrayant.
Je devais parler
de sexe et d'héroïne.
Todd et moi étions seulement amis.
Je n'étais pas à l'hôtel
et il ne s'est jamais drogué.
Et son arrestation à la fac ?
Un mensonge.
Au téléphone,
l'homme m'a menacée.
Je m'en moquais, j'ai dit
que j'alerterais la presse.
ll m'a envoyé un pli.
C'est mon père.
J'ai dû choisir entre la mémoire
de Todd et la vie de mon père.
Vous avez bien fait.
Vous savez qui Todd devait voir ?
ll a seulement dit :
''Je serai bientôt dans le journal.''
Et il a tapoté sa mallette.
A cause du contenu !
Venez chez moi,
vous y serez en sécurité.
Les monstres sont partout.
Pour Todd,
Washington était une mascarade
peuplée de monstres.
Pour changer les choses,
les masques doivent tomber.
C'est pour ça qu'il est mort.
Pas d'espoir.
C'est quoi, l'espoir, Angelo ?
Sydney a perdu espoir.
Quel rapport avec la montre ?
Le Centre prend l'espoir.
Qu'ont-ils pris ?
Cherchez dans le dossier de Syd
un lien avec l'espoir.
M. Parker enlève l'espoir à Sydney.
En quoi mon père est concerné ?
Je cuisine pour vous ?
Sans façon.
Légumes, poulet ou crevettes.
Crevettes, c'est presque bon.
Tentant, mais c'est non.
Je vous écoute.
Baxter dit à son amie Emily
que son nom
va être dans le journal,
qu'il a une chose importante
dans sa mallette.
3 jours après, le journaliste
chargé de l'affaire
meurt dans un accident.
Un accident étrange.
Des traces de ligature,
comme Baxter.
Baxter devait
lui faire des révélations
à l'hôtel.
Le contenu de la mallette !
Pourquoi êtes-vous
si sûr de vous ?
Je me suis mis
dans la peau du tueur.
Le tueur veut camoufler
la découverte de Todd,
il doit aussi tuer le journaliste.
Je ne crois pas.
Le tueur aime dominer sa victime,
il y a de la pureté
dans cette violence.
ça le satisfait. Quelqu'un
d'autre doit tirer les ficelles.
Vraiment ?
D'où sort cette théorie ?
Attendez !
ll y a deux suspects ?
Mettez-vous d'accord.
Le temps presse, Jarod.
Holder, dans mon bureau.
ll faut qu'on parle.
- Talbot va nous bloquer.
- Pas moi.
ll faudrait des mois pour rouvrir
le dossier. On doit collaborer.
Pas à l'aveuglette.
Comment fonctionnez-vous ?
C'est compliqué.
ll y a des preuves
de camouflage.
- Pas par ce tueur.
- Par qui ?
Baxter devait voir le journaliste
pour démasquer le tueur.
ll a peut-être
simplement besoin de tuer.
lmpossible.
Mettez-vous dans sa peau.
Comment vous faites ?
C'est compliqué.
Je crois que
dans d'autres circonstances,
vous et moi...
on serait quand même
en désaccord.
Ah bon ?
Pour commencer, vous buvez
de la poudre et de l'eau chaude.
On ne sait jamais
si une chose est bonne
avant d'y avoir goûté.
Si on réussit, je vous ferai
ma délicieuse bouillabaisse.
Vraiment ?
ça se boit dans une tasse ?
Dans ce qu'on veut.
<i>Vous cherchez votre famille ?</i>
<i>Oui, ils sont quelque part.</i>
<i>J'avais 1 0 ans</i>
<i>à la mort de mon père.</i>
<i>C'est jeune pour devenir</i>
<i>l'homme de la maison.</i>
<i>Vous avez grandi vite.</i>
<i>Très.</i>
<i>ça m'a donné le sens</i>
<i>des responsabilités,</i>
<i>du devoir</i>
<i>et l'envie de le transmettre.</i>
<i>L'envie de le transmettre.</i>
<i>ll a dit :</i>
<i>''Je serai bientôt dans le journal. ''</i>
<i>Et il a tapoté sa mallette.</i>
<i>A cause du contenu !</i>
Ce n'est pas logique !
Vous savez ce qui m'échappe ?
Pourquoi tuer Todd
à cause de ces documents ?
On dirait qu'ils ont été
choisis au hasard.
Pour remplacer les autres.
Quelqu'un les a échangés
parce que Todd en savait trop.
Reste à savoir qui !
On l'aura.
- Wilkes.
<i>- lci Malone.</i>
J'ai étudié les documents
de la mallette de Baxter. Rien.
<i>Mais j'ai du nouveau.</i>
L'histoire d'héroïne à la fac ?
C'est faux.
Le flic qui a arrêté Baxter
n'existe pas.
<i>On veut salir son passé.</i>
Je vous rappelle.
On va faire un tour.
Laissez-moi vous expliquer
quelque chose.
Je crois pas au complot,
mais je connais cette ville.
Si ça continue avec Baxter,
on va se faire des ennemis
et le payer.
Et Baxter ?
ll n'avait pas d'ennemis ?
ll avait des choses à révéler.
Ainsi que de l'héroïne,
des barbituriques
et des menottes.
C'était un tordu.
Dire que j'ai engagé Baxter !
ll faut retrouver le flic
qui l'a arrêté à la fac.
C'est fait.
Vous lui avez parlé ?
Je m'en serais passé, croyez-moi.
Jerry a vu la vérité
dès le départ.
Moi aussi,
je commence à la voir.
Linden a échangé les dossiers ?
Jolie théorie.
Hélas, les originaux
ont dû être déchiquetés.
ll va falloir fouiller
les poubelles.
Psy et complètement fou !
C'était dans un sac du Centre.
Et la montre ?
- Je ne veux pas revivre ça.
- Quoi ?
On l'a aidé. C'était affreux.
Alors, explique-moi.
C'est un jour nouveau, non ?
ll y a des années,
Sydney a tué une femme.
Agent Wilkes, justement,
je vous cherchais !
On se connaît.
Vous avez déjà travaillé
avec nous. Sous un autre nom.
Vous êtes qui ?
Pour qui vous travaillez ?
Le Congrès.
Je m'occupe d'un comité
de surveillance de la loi.
D'où votre insigne à Atlanta.
Pourquoi êtes-vous ici ?
Le comité m'envoie
pour clarifier l'affaire Baxter.
ça n'explique pas tout.
Je vous expliquerai
ce que vous voulez,
mais je tiens
le tueur de Baxter
et j'ai besoin de vous.
Syd a tué une femme ?
Dans un accident de voiture,
au début du projet Jarod.
Syd avait engagé
une étudiante française.
- Une jeune fille.
- Jolie !
lls avaient une liaison.
lls revenaient du restaurant
et Sydney a percuté un arbre.
Elle est morte 2 h après.
- Elle s'appelait Espoir.
- Claudia !
ça explique les propos d'Angelo.
Voici le rapport sur l'accident.
Pourvu qu'il nous mène à Syd.
''La Provence''.
lls ont dû y dîner.
Essayons.
Vous avez tout recollé ?
Oui, 6 422 bandes.
Après, j'en ai eu marre.
Mais pas Baxter.
Entre ces articles
et les mémos, Baxter a relié
Linden à des opérations illégales
et d'autres faux suicides.
Todd voulait changer les choses.
Dites-m'en tant !
Vous m'en direz tant !
Je savais
que c'était un truc comme ça.
Bailey m'a parlé de vous.
Votre comité apprend à se mettre
dans la peau des gens ?
Non, ça relève plutôt
des devoirs à la maison.
Drôle de maison !
Si vous saviez !
J'ai décidé de ne pas attendre.
Goûtez ça.
Votre bouillabaisse ?
Comment trouvez-vous le temps
de faire tout ça ?
On a tous nos secrets.
Pas vrai, Jarod ?
ça n'aide
que jusqu'au lendemain matin.
Je reviendrai à ce moment-là.
On sait, pour l'accident.
Je suis
avec mes fantômes préférés.
Alors, laissez-moi tranquille.
Vous ne renonceriez pas
aussi facilement.
Ce n'était pas votre faute.
Oubliez Claudia.
Je ne peux pas.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que.
lls l'ont utilisée contre moi.
Le Centre vous a aidé.
Ben voyons !
lls sont arrivés
juste après l'accident.
Des nettoyeurs
ont crié : ''Claudia
''sera bien soignée !''
2 h après,
j'ai appris la nouvelle.
Cette montre
était pour son anniversaire.
ça aurait été hier.
Comment Angelo a su...
Comment Angelo sait-il
quoi que ce soit ?
ll savait que vous aviez besoin
d'affronter ce chagrin,
que vous étiez amoureux.
Angelo n'a pas dit ça.
C'est eux.
Mon père l'a dit.
Le dossier aussi.
Le Centre ment !
Doucement !
Plus tard, quand j'ai découvert
comment le Centre utilisait Jarod,
j'ai protesté.
lls ont utilisé l'accident ?
Je l'aimais... comme ma fille,
mon élève.
Mais le Centre a inventé
une liaison entre nous.
lls m'ont menacé de la prison.
- lls m'ont menacé...
- De vous retirer Jarod.
lls m'ont forcé à leur obéir.
Non seulement
Claudia était morte,
mais ils ont voulu
salir sa mémoire.
Mon père vous a fait ça ?
Pas directement, bien sûr.
Mais en effet, M. Parker
dirigeait le Centre.
Buvez un coup !
Todd Baxter en savait trop.
ll avait relié Linden
à des opérations illégales :
meurtres, extorsions,
entre autres affaires
clandestines.
Linden a changé 6 fois de poste
en 7 ans.
Services des voyages,
ministère de la Justice...
On a rien contre lui.
ça lui rapportait gros.
ll a des comptes bien garnis.
Baxter l'a découvert
et ce salaud l'a tué.
ll a maquillé ça en overdose.
J'y ai cru.
Mais Linden n'est pas un tueur.
Vous lisez mutuellement
dans vos pensées ?
Linden n'a pas
un profil de tueur.
ll aime contrôler la vérité.
ll n'était pas à l'hôtel.
Quelqu'un a fait le sale boulot ?
On se lance ?
Pas question.
ll y a un tueur
et Linden va nous mener
jusqu'à lui.
Le Centre est responsable,
toi aussi.
J'ai suivi
les ordres du Triumvirat.
Je le savais !
Quelle arrogance !
Je veux que Sydney
puisse tourner la page.
C'est facile.
M. Morgenstern.
Je l'ai fait revenir.
Elle est psychiatre
dans un hôpital près de Paris.
Un hôpital fondé par le Centre.
Après l'accident, elle a guéri.
On lui a offert un avenir.
Et dit que Sydney était mort.
C'est un ordre que je déplore.
Tout change, je te l'ai dit.
C'est un jour nouveau !
lci Linden.
<i>Je vous surveille.</i>
C'est qui ?
Celui que vous avez engagé
pour tuer Todd Baxter.
Baxter s'est suicidé.
Vous m'avez engagé pour le tuer.
<i>Qui ne dit mot consent.</i>
Si vous voulez vous expliquer,
discrètement...
<i>venez au River Glen Hotel,</i>
chambre 81 4.
ll y a quelqu'un ?
Je suis pas assez fou
pour être armé !
Je vais voir si vous êtes fou.
Agent Wilkes !
Qu'y a-t-il ?
C'est le River Glen Hotel,
pas le Watergate.
Mais les scandales existent aussi.
S<i>i vous n'avez pas d'argent,</i>
<i>dites adieu à votre liberté.</i>
<i>Je suis innocent.</i>
<i>Et ces documents ?</i>
lls prouvent le contraire.
<i>Enquête évitée</i>
Beau travail !
Des mensonges pour me détruire.
Comme ceux que vous créez
et que Baxter avait découverts.
Vous vous enrichissez
en détruisant la vie des gens.
Et en les achevant.
Vous cherchez à me faire avouer
une chose que j'ignore
pour vous ou...
<i>ceuX qui regardent.</i>
Bon sang !
Vous faites erreur.
Exact.
J'aurais jamais dû croire
que vous puissiez dire vrai.
C'est fini.
ça ne fait...
que commencer.
- Allons-y.
- Laissez-lui une minute.
Ne ratez pas ça.
Quoi ?
Votre suicide.
Que faites-vous ?
Je plante le décor.
Comme pour Todd Baxter.
ça ressemblera...
à une overdose.
Puis, vous sauterez
par la fenêtre.
Pourvu qu'on trouve vite
votre corps.
Attendez !
Qui a fait ça ?
Dites-moi qui a tué Baxter
ou on vous repêche dans le Potomac.
Je peux vous payer.
De l'argent ?
Todd m'a sauvé la vie,
je veux le venger !
Vous êtes fou !
<i>Lâchez-moi !</i>
Comment ?
Vous prévenez votre complice ?
Avouez ou je vous jette
par la fenêtre !
Holder !
- Où est-il ?
- Dans l'ascenseur,
au bout du couloir.
- Bonne chance.
- A vous aussi.
Encore de la bouillabaisse ?
Non, je n'avais que 30 secondes.
Potage au poulet.
Presque bon.
Voilà pourquoi vous vous cachez.
Vous êtes seul au monde.
On a tous nos secrets.
Pas de famille ? Pas d'amis ?
Pas encore.
Je dois retourner au bureau.
Cette affaire
vous tenait à coeur.
Pourquoi ?
Disons que je voulais aider
un vieil ami.
Si vous voulez une nouvelle amie,
appelez-moi.

Jarod aurait pu
nous attirer prčs des casinos.
J'aurais pu jouer au craps.
A la place, du pur malt,
comme vous vouliez. Et puis,
l'ami de Jarod lui a dit
de venir ici dans son e-mail.
ll tombera dans nos mains.
Mes mains.
Allez dans votre chambre.
C'est ma chambre.
Notre chambre.
La suite nuptiale.
Męme pas aprčs 4 verres.
Mlle Parker, c'est parfait.
Pourquoi Sydney et Lyle
viennent demain ?
Si Jarod voit une femme
et 3 hommes sur le registre,
il saura qu'on est lŕ.
Comme ça, si on fait semblant
d'ętre de jeunes mariés,
il ne saura rien.
C'est votre idée.
Elle est bonne, non ?
Vous et Syd, c'est pas plausible.
ll est âgé et flamand.
Et vous ętes jeune.
A moins que vous préfériez
dormir avec Lyle. Le Centre
est malsain, mais votre frčre...
Du calme, Roméo.
Je n'irai pas plus loin.
Prenez le 1 er quart.
Si quelqu'un
arrive, sonnez l'alerte.
Si vous vous endormez,
ce sera une sacrée lune de miel.

Des entités multi-culturelles
et tout le tremblement.
Au revoir, Argyle.
Attends, J-dog.
Me laisse pas tomber.
Je n'ai que toi.
Je suis dans la mouise.
S'il te plaît.
<i>Ra</i>y<i>mond Chandler avait un secret</i>

<i>''Dans le doute, fais entrer</i>

<i>D'accord, c'est une glace.</i>
<i>Mais une glace ŕ la pistache.</i>
<i>Et je suis allergique.</i>
- Dick Dixon ?
- Moi ? Non.
Je suis son associé.
Voici Dick Dixon.
ça fait mal ? Essaie ça.
Appelons cette histoire
''Mort ŕ la crčme''.
Notre amateur de pistache
patientera.
Le Caméléon est maintenant
Dick Dixon, détective privé.
Voici le topo.
Le nouveau boulot d'Argyle
était pure fiction.
Dick Dixon n'est plus ici.
ll est parti l'an dernier,
couvert de dettes.
Argyle était son associé
depuis une semaine.
ll travaillait dans l'immeuble
comme ''technicien d'accueil''.
Moi, j'appelle ça un concierge.
ll était en train d'astiquer
le bureau abandonné de Dixon
quand elle est arrivée.
Je cherche Dick.
Vous savez, Dick.
Dick Dixon.
ll est parti.
Parti ?
ll a pris la poudre d'escampette,
ce genre de truc.
Vous travaillez pour lui ?
Si je travaille pour lui ?
Je suis son alter ego,
son coup de grâce,
son compagnon d'armes.
Je suis son associé, bon sang !
Vous faites le sale boulot ?
C'est drôle.
Cette serpilličre...
Je suis ici incognito.
Je suis ce qu'on appelle
un associé clandestin.
Ce que Dick veut,
Argyle le fait.
Un nom intéressant.
On me l'a donné
ŕ cause de ma tache de naissance.
Vous voulez la voir ?
C'est typique.
Ne pleurez pas.
J'aime pas voir une fille pleurer.
Prenez ça.
ça va aller.
Vous vous appelez ?
Mona.
Comme Mona Lisa ?
C'est trčs beau.
Ecoutez, Mona.
Je peux vous aider.
Parlez-moi.
Je suis call-girl
au Club Ali Bar.
Mon patron
a des ennuis.
Des ennuis ?
Comment s'appelle votre patron ?
- Dirty Willie.
- ll est sale ?
Non. C'est juste un surnom.
C'est un homme bon.
ll s'occupe bien de nous.
On a une bonne mutuelle dentaire.
C'est capital.
Ce pot de monnaie
est tout ce qui lui reste.
Et il m'a dit de le porter
ŕ monsieur Dixon.
Je le porterai
ŕ M. Dixon.
Willie sait des choses.
Qu'il devrait pas savoir.
- ll faut le protéger.
- Soyez tranquille.
Argyle est sur le coup.
<i>Arg</i>y<i>le est sur le coup.</i>
<i>Cinq mots ŕ vous faire</i>
<i>frissonner l'échine.</i>
<i>Arg</i>y<i>le a collé au cliché,</i>
<i>se donnant le rôle</i>
<i>d'un détective privé</i>
<i>de premičre catégorie.</i>
<i>Décidé ŕ aider Mona,</i>
<i>il est allé au Club Ali Bar.</i>
<i>En bon détective,</i>
<i>il cherchait des indices.</i>
<i>Tout ce qui pourrait</i>
<i>le conduire ŕ Dirt</i>y <i>Willie.</i>
<i>Mais il n'avait pas</i>
<i>l'étoffe d'une star.</i>
<i>Quand les choses</i>
<i>sont devenues sérieuses,</i>
<i>il aurait volontiers</i>
<i>joué les figurants.</i>
Dirty Willie.
<i>ll avait résolu l'affaire...</i>
<i>trouvé l'assassin,</i>
<i>alors Arg</i>y<i>le a fait</i>
<i>ce qu'il sait faire.</i>
<i>ll a pas vu le tueur.</i>
<i>Normal, ŕ cette vitesse.</i>
<i>ll était presque sűr que le tueur</i>
<i>l'avait pas vu. Presque.</i>
<i>Ce qui nous ramčne</i>
<i>ŕ notre bouffeur de pistaches.</i>
<i>ll se demandait</i>
<i>la męme chose que moi.</i>
Oů est Mona ?
J'en sais rien.
Elle m'a dit
qu'elle allait te voir, Dixon.
Elle est partie ?
Elle a dit oů ?
Elle m'a rien dit.
- Elle a rien laissé ?
- Je cause pas
aux gorilles armés.
Ta mčre doit ętre fier de toi,
mon gros !
Elle me flanquerait une rouste.
Ma mčre est morte.
Je suis pas un gorille.
Je suis Mike, le frčre de Mona.
Salut, Mike.
C'est pas le genre
ŕ disparaître.
A la mort de nos parents,
j'ai promis de veiller sur Mona.
Je veux ętre sűr
qu'elle va bien.
Vous le serez.
Dčs qu'on saura
quelque chose, on vous le dira.
Pas vrai, associé ?
Dick Dixon est sur le coup.
Choisis un nom au pif.
T'es M. Positif.
Le Shah du Je-peux.
Super bagnole !
Un privé doit toujours
avoir une décapotable.
Tu viens pas.
Comment ça ?
Je ne suis pas un privé.
Si tu veux mon aide,
bas les pattes.
- C'était agressif.
- Comment je te sauve la vie,
si tu t'emmęles dans tes bobards ?
Réfléchis.
J'ai réfléchi !
En long, en large et en travers.
J'ai mené la vida loca.
Depuis que tu nous as aidés,
papa et moi, je me suis
racheté une conduite.
J'ai fait que des boulots honnętes.
y manquait qu'un truc :
l'amour de ma vie.
Je l'ai rencontrée
la semaine derničre.
Mona est la femme de ma vie.
Tu as passé 6 mn avec elle.
360 glorieuses secondes.
ll s'est passé un truc
entre nous. Electrique
ou chimique, je sais pas.
Les phéromones, mon pote.
Mon futur beau-frčre
pleure dans ses pistaches.
Laisse-moi t'accompagner.
J-man, J-dog... Je t'en supplie.
<i>ll</i> y <i>a des moments, dans la vie,</i>
<i>oů il faut penser avec son coeur.</i>
<i>Ce n'était pas un de ces moments,</i>
<i>mais je l'ai cru.</i>
<i>D'oů l'erreur suivante.</i>
S'il te plaît !
Monte.
Argyle est sur le coup.
C'est parti !
Comment ai-je atterri
dans ce cauchemar ?
Je me souviens...
Je guettais Jarod
et vous m'avez regardé
avec des yeux polissons.
Je n'ai pas fait ça.
On n'a pas fait ça.
Comment le savez-vous ?
Les poules n'ont pas de dents.
C'est pas la saint-glinglin
et vous ętes pas
le dernier homme sur terre.
Quoi ?
Alors, cette planque ?
Sydney, comment allez-vous ?
Je vais bien.
Les Nettoyeurs
n'ont pas de vos nouvelles.
ll y a eu un imprévu.
J'ai eu une panne d'oreiller.
Mais Broots... Je m'habille.
<i>J'arrive demain</i>
<i>avec L</i>y<i>le et Raines.</i>
<i>Tout va bien ?</i>
Je ne sors que des 7 !
Si vous faites
la moindre allusion ŕ ça
quand ils arrivent,
je vous ampute la tęte.
Et ça, alors ?
Pas de ''ça''.
ll ne s'est rien passé.
Comme je le disais,
c'était un cauchemar.
Je suis ravie d'ętre réveillée.
ça vous arrive de penser
ŕ mes sentiments ?
En quoi suis-je
si repoussant ?
Vous tenez ŕ le savoir ?
Oui, je tiens ŕ le savoir.
Taisez-vous et écoutez-moi.
Ce que je trouve hautement
rébarbatif, chez vous,
c'est que votre idée du risque
est de sortir sans déodorant.
Aprčs une fusillade,
vous ętes celui
qui tremble dans un coin.
Ce qui, dans la vie,
est le comble du médiocre.
Et je ne veux pas d'un nul.
Arrętez.
A moi de parler.
Taisez-vous
et écoutez-moi.
Vous avez raison.
Je n'ai jamais pris un risque
car depuis que je vous connais,
un seul risque me tente.
Lequel ?
Vous ętes dans votre bureau.
ll est tard
et j'entre discrčtement.
Dans une main, j'ai des gardénias.
Dans l'autre,
une bouteille de pur malt.
Vos deux choses préférées.
Et je trouve ce petit point
derričre votre nuque.
Et je le masse bien comme il faut
pour faire passer la migraine
que vous avez chaque jour ŕ 1 8h20.
Celle dont vous ne parlez jamais.
En vérité,
si je n'avais qu'une chance,
vous savez ce que je ferais ?
Je vous ferais passer
cette douleur.
Vous auriez du bol
d'avoir un nul comme moi.
Vous entendez ?
Les poules claquent des dents.
<i>La vie est bizarre.</i>
<i>1 h sous le soleil du Nevada</i>
<i>et je croulais sous les m</i>y<i>stčres.</i>
<i>Le meurtre de Dirt</i>y <i>Willie,</i>
<i>la disparition de Mona...</i>
<i>Mais Arg</i>y<i>le devait voir</i>
<i>son pčre Benn</i>y<i>,</i>
<i>un ancien fan du pape.</i>
<i>J'allais découvrir</i>
<i>qu'il s'était converti.</i>
Wayne Newton est plus
que le saint homme.
C'est le chaman de Vegas.
Le Duc de la ville.
Wayne Newton est Las Vegas.
Si vous le dites.
Je l'ai quasiment rencontré.
Mon Adela et moi, on l'a vu
ŕ Vegas il y a longtemps.
Qui eűt cru
que je reviendrais ŕ Vegas
avec Argyle,
dans cette exquise maison
de golf ?
Attention !
Le terrain est ouvert.
La seule qui manque,
c'est mon Adela.
On aurait fęté
nos 50 ans de mariage.
Elle était ma muse, Jarod.
C'est pour elle
- que j'écris une chanson ŕ Wayne.
- On a pas le temps.
Mais si. Le grand W
a changé notre vie.
Adela voulait
que je lui écrive une chanson,
une sorte de variante
de Danke Schön.
<i>Elle m'a dit de l'appeler</i>
Auf Wiedersehen.
Et voilŕ le travail.
Oů est la chanson ?
J'y travaille.
Elle sera pręte demain.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, demain ?
Wayne joue dans un tournoi
de charité
et il sera lŕ, avec son club.
Et moi, je serai lŕ
et je lui enverrai le tintouin.
Je ne connais rien au golf,
mais ça le dérangera pas ?
Si, mais la derničre volonté
d'Adela vaut bien ça, non ?
Largement.
Le grand W va adorer,
mais on a un tueur ŕ attraper.
Et moi, une chanson ŕ écrire.
A plus tard, papa.
<i>C'était chouette de revoir Benn</i>y<i>,</i>
<i>mais Arg</i>y<i>le avait raison :</i>
<i>on avait un tueur ŕ attraper.</i>
<i>On est donc retournés</i>
<i>sur le lieu du crime.</i>
Dirty Willie a claqué ici.
Et j'ai vu le tueur par ici.
Hé, Charlot ?
C'est privé, ici.
Mes stars font leur entrée
sur la plus grande scčne
de Las Vegas, alors dégagez,
vous et votre accoutrement.
Je vais vous expliquer.
y a rien ŕ expliquer.
Qui vous ętes ?
Dick Dixon.
Vous ętes Dick Dixon ?
Vous avez couché avec ma femme !
Je la connais męme pas.
Chambre nl38,
ça vous dit rien, citrouille ?
Eh, demi-portion,
on s'en tape de ta grosse.
On cherche Mona Jeffries.
Je l'ai pas vue.
Vous allez faire quoi ?
Mon Chivas est foutu !
- Oů t'as appris ça ?
- J'ai tenu un dôjô.
On vous écoute.
Je vous dirai
ce que j'ai dit aux flics.
Mona est pas une call-girl
typique. Elle montre pas
ses lolos et économise son blé.
Elle s'est payé un appart.
Oů ça ?
Je vais vous le dire !
Je te couvre, J-man.
C'est trčs rassurant.
Soit Mona est bordélique,
soit elle a eu des ennuis.
Bougez pas.
Vos papiers.
Dans la voiture.
Je suis Dick Dixon.
Vous ętes Dick Dixon ?
Vous avez couché
avec un agent.
Elle a démissionné.
J'ai l'air de faire ça aux gens.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Vous perdez la main, détective ?
On nous a signalé
du grabuge.
La porte a été forcée.
C'est le foutoir,
mais ses clés de voiture sont lŕ.
- Mona s'en allait ?
- Non.
On l'a enlevée.
Tu vas ouvrir ?
Ce sont les monstres de la nuit.
C'est la suite nuptiale.
Syd, vous ętes en avance.
J'étais inquiet.
En fait, ça va changer,
dorénavant.
J'ai plus une goutte
d'eau chaude, crétin !
Vous disiez, Broots ?
Vous venez me délivrer ?
La compagnie de Felix Unger
me rend contente
de voir votre triste figure.
Lyle et moi
sommes descendus au Ceasar.
Des chambres séparées ?
Des suites séparées.
Je repasserai.
On prendra le relais.
Si j'ai pas refroidi Broots avant.
Prévenez-moi s'il arrive.
Quoi ?
Je pensais que ça changerait
entre nous.
ll n'y a pas de ''nous''.
Du moins, pas ŕ leur connaissance.
Tu imagines
ce qu'ils feraient s'ils savaient ?
Ce serait bęte d'apporter de l'eau
ŕ leur moulin.
A propos, mon moulin...
est vide.
J'ai compris, poupée.
Mais si on fait ça,
il faut le faire bien.
J'ai un fantasme
que j'aimerais réaliser avec toi.
Mais d'abord, tu dois m'appeler...
Puff Daddy.
Dis-le.
Puff...
Daddy.

<i>''Dans le doute,</i>

Plusieurs choses ne collent pas.
D'aprčs l'autopsie,
la mort de Dirty Willie
résulte d'un manque d'oxygčne
dű ŕ l'hypothermie.
Un froid extręme.
ll est mort de froid ŕ Vegas ?
Et ses mains sont percées
au pic ŕ glace.
Je pense ŕ la torture.
Une seconde, J-man.
Tu crois que ces types
feraient ça
- ŕ Mona ?
- Espérons que non.
D'aprčs ce dossier,
voici le suspect nl1 .
Constantin
Falzone, un racketteur
du clan des Pozavac.
y a quoi d'autre qui cloche ?
Dirty Willie pesait 1 50 kg.
Gelé ou pas,
ça fait lourd pour un seul homme
ŕ trimballer.
Oů tu veux en venir ?
ll y a 2 tueurs. lls ont torturé
Dirty Willie avant de le congeler.
Reste ŕ savoir
ce qu'ils lui voulaient.
Fastoche !
Du blé, de l'artiche !
Falzone est connu
comme racketteur.
Dirty Willie refusait peut-ętre
de raquer et les jumeaux
ont pété les plombs.
Des armoires ŕ glace
qui bossent pour Falzone.
ll les appelle ses Caddies.
Ses Caddies ? Pourquoi ?
<i>falzone. Un ancien</i>
<i>de la ville du péché.</i>
<i>ll se moque des supermarchés,</i>
<i>ou d'une Tour Eiffel</i>
<i>en plein désert. ll ne s'intéresse</i>
<i>qu'au fric et au golf.</i>
Ces gorilles ont tué Dirty Willie
et enlevé ma Mona.
On les bute
et on zigouille Falzone.
On confronte Falzone
sur son terrain.
Mais tu sais pas jouer.
Simple affaire de géométrie
et de physique. Facile.
<i>D'aprčs</i> Sy<i>dne</i>y<i>, les simulations</i>
<i>les plus dures ont leur secret.</i>
<i>Une fois qu'on l'a découvert,</i>
<i>ça vient naturellement.</i>
<i>En 56 mn,</i>
<i>j'ai découvert le secret</i>
<i>du golf. Je vous le dirai,</i>
<i>un jour.</i>
<i>Les jumeauX étaient épatés.</i>
<i>falzone voulait me défier.</i>
<i>J'ai dit</i>
<i>que j'étais Dic</i>k <i>DiXon.</i>
<i>Devinez lequel était marié.</i>
<i>Les jumeauX ont promis</i>
<i>de nous mener ŕ falzone.</i>
<i>Ce qu'ils ont fait.</i>
<i>Mais, comme dans un bon Chandler,</i>
<i>il</i> y <i>avait un hic.</i>
<i>On s'était fait doubler.</i>
<i>Dire que j'avais gâché 56 mn...</i>
<i>D'aprčs Chandler,</i>
<i>rien n'est plus accrocheur</i>
<i>qu'un cadavre.</i>
<i>Mais Chandler n'écrivait pas, lŕ.</i>
J'ai des balles !
J'ai des balles !
lncroyable !
y a des gens qui les ont jetées.
Et elles sont ŕ vous ?
Possession vaut titre.
Vous devriez le savoir.
On dit que vous volez les femmes.
Et que vous pendez
les Dirty Willie.
Et que vous enlevez
les Mona Jeffries.
J'ai l'impression
que vous trichez au golf.
Si on ne triche pas,
on ne joue pas.
Je veux retrouver Mona.
Qui vous ętes ? Petit Dick ?
Je vais vous en donner,
du petit !
Dirty Willie payait toujours.
J'avais aucune raison
de le tuer.
Quant ŕ Mona,
un consommateur de Viagra
comme moi ne peut qu'espérer
se taper un morceau pareil.
Basta ! Vous et moi,
ça va chier.
- ll me gonfle !
- J'ai pas d'embrouille
avec Dirty Willie,
ni avec vous, Dixon.
Mona m'a demandé de l'aide.
Dirty Willie
se faisait taxer
par 2 gorilles
appelés les Frost Brothers.
Les Frost Brothers ?
Les Frost Brothers.
Je contrôle les casinos
dans toute la ville.
J'ai jamais entendu parler d'eux.
C'est tout ce que je sais.
Terminé ?
Allons-y.
Mes balles.
Service d'étage.
Devine ce que m'a dit
le manager.
Quoi donc,
- M. Broots ?
- Bienvenue parmi nous.
Des employés de sexe opposé
ne dorment pas ensemble.
Montre-lui.
Prise par une caméra de sécurité
ŕ l'aéroport McCarren.
Jarod a quitté la ville.
Votre théorie ne tient pas.
On rentre.
Son e-mail dit qu'il arrive.
On doit rester.
- Broots, c'est fini.
- Non.
Le manager a une réservation
au nom de Jarod Segal.
Comme Bugsy Segal,
le fondateur de Las Vegas.
Une réservation ne prouve rien.
On s'en va.
On reste.
ll nous a ignorés ?
Vous pouvez tenter de m'intimider,
pas discuter mes compétences.
Je ne suis plus médiocre.
Je fais bien mon boulot.
Si vos esprits paranos
ne pigent pas ça,
partez !
Mlle Parker et moi,
on attend Jarod.
Bon petit-déjeuner.
Si on attrape pas Jarod,
c'est fini.
- Nous deux ?
- Notre peau.
<i>En rentrant chez Benn</i>y<i>,</i>
<i>Arg</i>y<i>le et moi</i>
<i>savions que sans</i>
<i>les m</i>y<i>stérieuX frost Brothers,</i>
<i>il n'</i>y <i>avait pas de Mona.</i>
<i>Pas de ręve pour Arg</i>y<i>le.</i>
<i>Mais le ręve d'Arg</i>y<i>le</i>
<i>n'était pas le seul menacé.</i>
Tous des salauds !
Que s'est-il passé ?
J'étais lŕ, dans le bunker,
en plein milieu de mon ouverture
et ils m'ont attrapé.
Les gorilles de Wayne.
Les hommes de Wayne
ne feraient jamais ça.
C'était les hommes
de l'orchestre de Wayne.
Ces magiciens aux cheveux longs.
Une chance qu'ils aient pas
amené leur tigre.
Wayne n'a pas entendu
votre chanson ?
ll l'aurait adorée.
Bien sűr.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
On n'a pas trouvé Mona.
Bon sang de bonsoir.
C'est toujours ŕ cause d'une fille.
Je vais vous confier un secret.
ll est exactement comme moi.
J'étais sauvage et débridé
avant qu'Adela m'apprivoise.
On était venus se changer
les idées ŕ Vegas.
Le Dr Kanapa nous avait dit
qu'on aurait pas d'enfant.
Je savais que c'était trčs dur
pour elle.
Mais mon Adela...
Comme elle était belle le soir
oů on est allés voir Wayne.
Vous n'avez jamais vu
une robe ŕ pois
comme ça de votre vie.
Le grand Wayne,
il l'a repérée dans la foule
et il a chanté Danke Schön
rien que pour elle.
C'était...
Comme un ręve.
Oui. Ce soir-lŕ,
Adela est revenue
au motel toute guillerette
aprčs le concert de Wayne.
Et on a mené
le troupeau dans la prairie
toute la nuit, si vous me suivez.
Et on a été bénis.
Vous avez conçu Argyle.
Bingo !
Quand je le vois
vivre tout ça,
je me dis :
''Oů serais-je aujourd'hui
sans mon Adela ?''
Elle était votre Mona.
Vous devez trouver cette fille
pour lui.
<i>Tous ceuX qui avaient vu Mona</i>
<i>la voulaient.</i>
<i>Arg</i>y<i>le, son frčre, falzone.</i>
<i>ça me titillait.</i>
Ecoute, vieux, je l'ai suivie
chez elle une fois. Deux.
<i>Nic</i>k <i>savait tout de Mona.</i>
<i>Oů elle vivait,</i>
<i>comment elle économisait.</i>
<i>ll connaissait peut-ętre</i>
<i>les frost Brothers.</i>
Je sais rien des Frost Brothers.
<i>C'était presque une impasse.</i>
<i>Presque.</i>
<i>L'agent W</i>y<i>att ne m'avait pas</i>
<i>frappé la 1 re fois.</i>
<i>ll me considérait en dette.</i>
ça commence ŕ bien faire.
Vous sabotez notre boulot.
On tient presque Falzone.
Arrętez-le.
Vous lui avez parlé !
Vous devriez connaître
les maničres de la ville.
Et celles des Frost Brothers ?
Quel rapport avec cet endroit ?
C'est un ancien entrepôt de viande
en dehors de la ville.
Je ne vous attendais pas.
Vous avez si froid.
On va vous tirer de lŕ.
Argyle, ces deux types
avaient des masques,
ils m'ont attrapée.
lls voulaient savoir
ce que Dirty Willie m'avait dit.
Je ne peux pas leur dire.
Je ne peux pas faire ça
- ŕ Willie.
- Vous pouvez nous le dire.
Plus tard. On doit filer.
On doit vous ramener
ŕ votre frčre.
Mon frčre ?
Je n'ai pas de frčre.
Mais si. Męme deux.
Dis bonjour aux Frost Brothers.
<i>C'était une affaire</i>
<i>digne de Chandler.</i>
<i>Récapitulons.</i>
<i>Nos deuX agents, W</i>y<i>att et Mi</i>k<i>e,</i>
<i>avaient tué Dirt</i>y <i>Willie.</i>
<i>lls l'avaient torturé,</i>
<i>congelé et pendu.</i>
<i>Mais ils lui voulaient quoi ?</i>
<i>De l'argent ? De l'artiche ?</i>
<i>Vous ne serez pas surpris</i>
<i>si je vous réponds ''non''.</i>
<i>Dirt</i>y <i>Willie</i>
<i>avait un sale petit secret</i>
<i>et ces t</i>y<i>pes essa</i>y<i>aient</i>
<i>de l'eXtorquer ŕ Mona et ŕ nous.</i>
ça fait 8 h.
Commencez ŕ parler.
J'ai rien ŕ dire.
Tu piges rien, Dixon ?
On est ŕ Las Vegas, ici.
Le frčre de Mona
va l'emmener dans le désert.
Si je l'appelle pas
dans 30 mn, elle est foutue.
Et je vous congčle
tous les deux.
Et je garde le chien.
Ne lui donnez rien, Argyle.
Pas une pičce.
Boucle ta cravate, le chien.
Drôle de truc ŕ dire.
Surtout qu'un chien
met pas de cravate.
Pas le chien. Mona.
Elle a dit : ''Pas une pičce.''
Mona a laissé un pot
plein de pičces ŕ Dixon.
Le secret de Dirty Willie,
ce qu'il voulait protéger,
était dans ce pot.
- Wyatt !
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Je vais lui donner
ce qu'il veut.
La voilŕ.
<i>Willie, si tu paies,</i>
<i>on sera gentils.</i>
C'était pas Falzone qui rackettait
Willie, mais vous.
Et le gros vilain
m'a enregistré.
Dire que la cassette
était lŕ...
Beau travail, détectives.
Willie voulait passer
cette bande ŕ Dixon.
Dites ŕ votre adjoint
de relâcher Mona.
Le pauvre Willie
ignorait que Dixon
avait quitté la ville.
Une seconde.
Vous ętes pas Dick Dixon ?
Perdu !
Coucou.
Détachez-moi.
Vous savez,
vous devriez protéger les gens,
pas les racketter.
Ce sont les maničres
de la ville.
On a déjŕ donné.
Essayons la maničre Jarod.
Vous ętes givré !
Si vous saviez...
Vous allez appeler
- pour relâcher Mona.
- Pas question.
C'est plus dur que le golf.
Vous ętes fou.
Appelez.
Perdu !
Derničre chance.
Attention !
<i>W</i>y<i>att a fini par appeler.</i>
<i>Et moi aussi...</i>
<i>Le f.B.l.</i>
<i>En arrivant au bureau,</i>
<i>ils ont trouvé un tueur</i>
<i>et les preuves</i>
<i>pour l'incriminer.</i>
<i>Le tout offert gracieusement</i>
<i>par le m</i>y<i>stérieuX Dic</i>k <i>DiXon.</i>
<i>Mais l'histoire n'est pas finie.</i>
<i>J'ai encore un boulot ŕ faire.</i>
Alors ?
Rien.
C'est ce qu'on sera
quand on rentrera
au Centre.
C'était sympa...
Puff Daddy.
Je ne suis plus un nul.
Tu aimes la mise ŕ niveau ?
J'ai un cadeau pour toi.
Les rééducateurs du Centre
effaceront ce week-end
de ton esprit.
Dis-leur que Broots m'a attrapé.
lnutile.
On forme une équipe, pas vrai,
Dr Funkenstein ?
Tout dépend
d'une chose, poupée.
Je suis ton Puff Daddy ?
Et j'ai funk...
de toi.
Je dois regarder ?
Tu as le droit de regarder.
Ecoute-moi, M. Funkadelic.
Si on doit le faire,
faisons-le bien.
A mon tour de réaliser
un fantasme.
Les chauves m'ont toujours
rendue folle.
Et il en faut plus d'un
pour me combler. M. Swing ?
Entrez !
Mlle Parker, et nous ?
<i>J'ai fun</i>k <i>de toi !</i>
M. Swing !
Je vous ai interdit de dormir.
- Je dormais ?
- Oui.
- Tout le temps ?
- Oui, Rip Van Winkle.
Et vous avez fait
de drôles de bruits.
Au fait,
c'est quoi, ''Puff Daddy'' ?
<i>Comme je disais,</i>
<i>il me reste un boulot ŕ faire.</i>
<i>Mais ce n'était pas ce ręve-lŕ.</i>
<i>C'était le ręve d'un autre.</i>
Je peux vous aider ?
Si vous saviez
comme je ręvais de rencontrer...
C'est un honneur.
- Un honneur.
- Ecoutez.
Troisičme rang, robe ŕ pois.
Adela.
- Elle portait une robe ŕ pois.
- Vous ętes un dieu.
Si j'ai bien compris,
vous vouliez
me jouer quelque chose ?
En fait, oui.
Vous ne voulez pas...
Avec joie.
C'est vrai ?
C'est parti.
<i>Auf wiedersehen, chérie</i>
<i>ça veut dire ''au revoir''</i>
<i>Je ne sais pas</i>
<i>Pourquoi j'ai si mal</i>
<i>Ce n'est pas</i>
<i>Mon goitre</i>
<i>Mais je dois reconnaître</i>
<i>Que męme dans ce désert</i>
<i>du Maroc</i>
<i>Je me sens comme un roc</i>
<i>Mais je veuX chanter ce refrain</i>
<i>Auf wiedersehen</i>
C'était vous, indéniablement.
Ce n'était que le 1 er couplet.
La suite arrive.
J'ai hâte. J'aimerais vous voir
tous ŕ mon concert.
Je mettrai vos noms
sur la liste.
Et sachez une chose :
Adela était ma muse,
ŕ moi aussi.
A ce soir.
Quel homme !
- Merci.
- Je vous en prie.
C'est la pire chanson
que j'aie entendue.
Je sais, mais pour lui,
c'est un ręve qui se réalise.
Vous les aimez beaucoup.
- ll a aimé.
- Succčs assuré.
A propos de ''beaucoup'',
merci pour la donation.
Pour une bonne cause.
C'est quoi, votre nom ?
En ville, tout le monde m'appelle
Dick Dixon.

Pardon, excusez-moi.
Vous Ítes nue !
Pas vous.
Soit vous vous dťshabillez,
soit je me rhabille.
On me poursuit...
Du calme, bricoleur.
Je rechargeais mon ‚me.
C'est comme le voyage
dans le temps dans Terminator.
C'est bon pour le karma.
C'est quoi ?
Chaque bonne action
vous revient comme un boomerang.
Votre ligne de vie
montre votre solitude.
Mais des familles
se retrouvent.
Comment ?
lls vous cherchent.
Vous rťunissez
les familles des autres.
Continuez comme Áa,
le bien reviendra.
Je dois filer.
Votre ligne de vie
dit autre chose.
Vous rencontrerez
quelqu'un de semblable.
Une ‚me soeur.
Votre pochette !
<i>Tu me manques, maman</i>
<i>Maison - Grand-pŤre - Moi</i>
<i>Maman</i>
<i>Vous rťunissez</i>

<i>On m'a enlevť ŗ ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble dťjŗ</i>

<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>

<i>Depuis mon ťvasion,</i>

<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous Ítes mťdecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Et votre petit-dťjeuner ?
Les crÍpes ťtaient dťlicieuses.
Ma petite femme
est un cordon-bleu.
J'y suis pas pour grand-chose !
Chuck, va ŗ l'arriŤre.
Si on me cherche,
j'ťteins des incendies.
A chaque jour
suffit sa peine.
La Buick !
L'abruti est au courant ?
La clope,
Áa peut tuer.
Viens vite.
- Jarod Gray.
- Vous Ítes en retard.
- C'est quoi ?
- Un test.
Jarod bosse
pour l'agence de sťcuritť.
Celle qu'on paie...
sans Ítre protťgťs.
Comment vous avez fait ?
C'ťtait dur.
Dťsolť pour le vacarme,
on aime garder nos gars au frais.
Sortez le chef de la sťcuritť
du coffre.
ll commence ŗ faire froid.
Chuck devient veilleur de nuit
et Jarod, chef de la sťcuritť.
Paie-le.
On a ce truc
au Nouveau-Brunswick.
Veilleur de nuit,
Áa te dit ?
Bienvenue.
Voici Jenna.
Votre visage
me dit quelque chose.
J'entends souvent Áa.
Mon petit frŤre va bien ?
Ses poumons n'ťtaient pas
assez dťveloppťs,
mais avec l'oxygŤne, Áa ira.
Mon petit gars !
Quel miracle !
Le vrai miracle serait
que nous repartions ŗ zťro.
La Bible dit
de tendre l'autre joue.
Je me souviens aussi de :
''OEil pour oeil...''
Un cadeau de Jarod.
Corinthiens 1 5.25 : ''MÍme un enfant
se reconnaÓt ŗ ses actes.''
Áa vous dit quelque chose,
l'ťvangťliste ?
Dieu vous bťnisse.
Allons-y, Willie.
C'est faux ?
C'ťtait Les Proverbes.
Bien sŻr, Raines l'ignorait.
Comment saviez-vous ?
Corinthiens, 1 5.25.
''Car son rŤgne doit durer
''jusqu'ŗ ce qu'il ait terrassť
ses ennemis.''
Le mot clť ťtant ''rŤgne''.
- Ce qui signifie ?
- Raines n'est pas un converti.
ll m'a demandť de lui pardonner.
Peut-Ítre que Raines
a trouvť Dieu.
ll aurait dŻ y penser
avant de tuer ma mŤre.
Trouvez ce que mijote ce salaud.
Regardez le nouveau ŗ l'oeuvre !
J'ai appelť votre employeur.
On n'enquÍte pas
que sur les clients ?
Qu'a dit Rudy ?
Vous Ítes de Baltimore, ex-flic.
Exact. 6 ans ŗ la Criminelle.
J'en ai eu marre.
ll faudrait changer la loi.
2 200 lois sur le port d'arme,
c'est trop.
Je suis
qu'un reprťsentant de commerce !
Pourquoi un flic
renonce ŗ la sťcuritť ?
Pourquoi un reprťsentant
a des gardes du corps ?
On a tous des ennemis, Jarod.
ll vous faudrait
un meilleur karma.
Comme un boomerang...
qu'on ne lance pas.
Áa va, Mme Pritchard ?
Je ne suis pas encore
Mme Pritchard.
On s'occupe du mariage
aprŤs samedi.
Le Nouveau-Brunswick !
J'ai un ami ŗ voir. Occupez-vous
de la Buick d'ici demain.
Je dois protťger
mon investissement.
Tu parles de moi
ou de la pierre ?
Quel veinard !
En plus, elle a de l'humour.
Elle est tout pour moi.
Risquez votre peau
pour elle plus que pour moi.
Espťrons ne pas en arriver lŗ.
Je dois voir ma fille, Dennis.
Elle est ŗ St Charles.
Non, je m'en vais.
Pas sans moi.
Ce sera pire aprŤs votre mariage.
ll vous surveillera.
- Quand vous aurez des enfants...
- Pas question.
Roland refuse.
ll est gentil.
Je dis pas le contraire.
Vous le pensiez.
Comme tout le monde.
Mais Roland
nous a fait une belle vie.
C'est comme un happy end.
Vous croyez
aux happy ends, non ?
A terre !
Prťviens-moi quand tu sors.
Merci.
Qui est le coupable ?
Comment il est arrivť jusqu'ici ?
- C'est ma faute.
- Non, la mienne.
J'allais prendre la voiture,
j'ai baissť la garde.
Vous l'avez sauvťe.
C'est l'essentiel.
Un jour,
elle portera mes enfants.
<i>Je dois voir ma fille, Dennis.</i>
<i>Elle est ŗ</i> S<i>t Charles.</i>
Qui tu es, mon vieux ?
Le corps du Christ.
Votre fille et moi,
on a un accord.
Qu'elle l'honore
si elle tient ŗ sa famille.
Dťsolť de vous dťranger.
Je repasserai.
J'ai du travail.
Parfait.
Surveillez mon trťsor.
Pas de problŤme.
Merci encore,
pour ce matin.
On en a pour notre argent.
Vous aviez raison,
on s'est dťjŗ vus.
Chez moi.
Agent Dennis Alonso.
ll m'a suivi ŗ la rťpťtition
de la communion de votre fille.
ll fait pression sur votre pŤre.
Pourquoi ?
Pour que vous tťmoigniez
contre votre fiancť ?
Je peux vous aider
ŗ rťunir votre famille.
Faites-moi confiance.
Je ne peux faire confiance
ŗ personne.
Vous ne savez pas
oý vous mettez les pieds.
Opťration Fat Cat.
Objectif : rassembler des preuves
sur Roland Pritchard, armurier,
blanchiment d'argent...
Vous Ítes qui ?
Un ex-flic qui peut vous aider
ŗ rťcupťrer votre fille.
Dites-moi qu'elle va bien.
Je vais finir cette mission.
Une mission ?
Attendez... Vous Ítes
de la rťpression des fraudes.
Depuis quand
vous avez cette couverture ?
1 2 mois, 1 3 jours.
Sťparťe de votre fille
depuis un an ?
Elle me manque.
Je vous ťcoute.
Sur la carte envoyťe par Jarod,
les versets sont un code
pour l'ordinateur de Raines.
Chaque jour depuis 6 mois,
Raines voit ce type.
Mon Dieu !
Giuseppe !
Vous le connaissez ?
Le lycťe de Rome.
Regardez-le.
Vous ťtiez ensemble ?
C'ťtait mon cavalier au bal.
ll a voulu marquer un panier
dans la Ferrari de son pŤre.
Je lui ai cassť un doigt.
ll est toujours canon !
Si vous le dites.
C'est toi, Parker ?
Tu as l'air trŤs en forme.
Toi aussi... trŤs en forme.
Attends-moi une minute.
Et ton doigt ?
ll est toujours tordu.
Je me sens coupable.
J'ai beaucoup changť
depuis ce temps-lŗ.
En effet.
Tout a commencť
quand on a su que Roland
trafiquait des armes.
Elles servaient
aux leÁons de tir.
L'opťration devait prendre
Puis c'est devenu un an.
J'ai commencť
comme assistante de Roland.
Puis il m'a invitťe ŗ sortir.
Rien de sťrieux.
Puis la tasse de cafť
s'est transformťe en une soirťe.
Alonso m'a forcťe ŗ continuer.
Et je me retrouve fiancťe !
Vous avez dťjŗ jouť un rŰle ?
Une ou deux fois.
Elle a vos yeux.
- Vous l'avez vue ?
- Oui, ainsi que votre pŤre.
lls ont l'air d'aller bien.
Quand les avez-vous vus ?
ll y a 2 mois.
J'y allais chaque semaine,
mais Alonso y a mis un terme.
ll trouvait que Roland
devenait trop proche.,
Et vous ?
Vous n'ťtiez pas trop proche ?
Vous croyez que Áa me plaÓt ?
Cassie a besoin de moi,
mais je peux pas arrÍter.
Et si Roland savait ?
Son pŤre est parti.
Elle ne peut pas
perdre aussi sa mŤre.
Je comprends.
Alonso m'empÍche
de voir Cass et mon pŤre.
ll faut coincer Fat Cat
ŗ tout prix.
Vous manquez de preuves
sur Pritchard ?
Ce n'est pas la cible.
On ignore toujours
ŗ qui va l'argent blanchi.
On le voit dans 2 jours.
L'ami du Nouveau-Brunswick !
Aidez-moi.
Gardez Áa.
C'ťtait ŗ ma mŤre.
Je veux qu'elle aille ŗ Cassie...
si Áa tourne mal.
Tout va s'arranger.
Et aprŤs ?
Je ne sais plus qui je suis.
Les gens changent.
On t'appelait ''le sournois''.
Pas ťtonnant
que tu sois le prÍtre de Raines.
William ?
Jarod m'a prťvenu.
Tu le connais ?
Le pŤre Jarod connaÓt l'ťvÍque.
M. Raines veut devenir diacre.
Voilŗ pourquoi il te voit.
Non, pour se confesser.
William vit avec des dťmons,
mais c'est un enfant de Dieu.
ll obtiendra l'absolution...
quels que soient ses pťchťs.
y compris le meurtre ?
ll dťplore la mort de Catherine,
regrette le chagrin
que Áa a causť ŗ sa fille.
Quels autres mensonges
a-t-il racontťs ?
Je ne peux pas le trahir.
Jarod s'intťresse ŗ une chose
dite par M. Raines ŗ son associť
dans le parking.
Au sujet du projet Veratos.
La vťritť.
Entendu dans le parking.
Et le secret de la confession ?
Tu es pire que Raines.
Tu es pleine de rage.
C'est ma religion.
J'arrive.
Je dois tťlťphoner.
lci Alonso.
Je suis comment ?
Vous Ítes un ex-flic. 6 ans
dans la police de Baltimore.
Vous g‚chez mon opťration !
Vous avez pas besoin de moi
pour Áa.
J'ai entendu Jenna vous engueuler.
Áa aurait pu Ítre Pritchard !
- Jen est ŗ cran.
- C'est normal !
Vous la faites presque chanter.
Pourquoi ne pas l'admettre ?
Pritchard
est de plus en plus menacť.
Je sais. Qui essaie de le tuer ?
Allez savoir !
Vous avez lu mon dossier.
J'ťtais un bon flic.
Qui essaie de le tuer ?
Peut-Ítre un client
que Pritchard veut doubler.
- ll est donc dangereux.
- Et comment !
- C'est-ŗ-dire ?
- Vous Ítes qui ?
Quelqu'un qui veut sauver
l'agent McGann.
ll y a un an, on a trouvť
un des fournisseurs de Pritchard
mort dans les bois.
ll avait doublť Pritchard.
On n'a pas trouvť l'arme.
Pritchard
n'a donc pas ťtť accusť.
Vous tenez la fille de Jenna.
On la protŤge.
En laissant sa mŤre
avec un tueur ?
Jen est un excellent agent
qui nous donnera ce qu'on veut.
Nous ou vous ?
M. McGann ?
Jarod Gray,
rťpression des fraudes.
Votre fille va bientŰt revenir.
Juste ŗ temps
pour la communion de Cassie ?
Je ne crois plus
ŗ ces mensonges.
C'est vrai.
Promis.
Un collŤgue de ta mŤre.
Maman attrape les mťchants.
C'est vrai, Cassie.
Tu lui manques beaucoup
et vous vous verrez bientŰt.
La nuit, je la vois en rÍve.
Mais c'est pas pareil.
Elle m'a dit de te donner Áa
pour que tu en prennes soin.
Regarde Áa !
La bague de ta grand-mŤre.
Maman n'est pas venue
depuis longtemps.
Elle ne veut pas nous voir ?
Bien sŻr que si.
Je vais te dire une chose :
garde-lui une place
pour ta communion.
C'est une sacrťe promesse
que vous faites.
Elle sera lŗ.
Baissez-vous !
Que le Ciel me tombe sur la tÍte !
Votre numťro de petit saint
commence ŗ s'user, diacre !
Vous avez parlť ŗ mon prÍtre.
Asseyez-vous.
On a suivi une route obscure,
nos empreintes cŰte ŗ cŰte.
Mais autrefois...
il n'y avait qu'une trace de pas.
A l'ťpoque oý je vous portais.
Je pensais que vous parliez
de la mort de ma mŤre.
Croyez ce que vous voulez.
Mais me pardonner
vous apportera la paix.
Oý Ítes-vous ?
Vous ne me croiriez pas.
Le projet Veratos de Raines...
<i>est une toXine eXpťrimentale</i>
<i>dťveloppťe au Centre</i>
<i>dans les annťes 80.</i>
Raines la ressuscite.
Certains ne rťsistent pas
ŗ la tentation.
Vous connaissez :
''Tu ne convoiteras point'' ?
Bien sŻr.
Ne violez pas ce commandement.
Merci encore.
Je fais mon boulot.
Et l'agresseur ?
Je dois parler aux flics.
Áa va ?
ll y a dans vos yeux
une inquiťtude sincŤre pour lui.
Assimilation affective.
Effet psychologique secondaire
d'une mission prolongťe.
Quel expert !
N'oubliez pas que votre fiancť
est un tueur.
Roland n'est ni un ange
ni un tueur.
- Alonso ne vous a pas dit ?
- Quoi ?
ll est incroyable !
Alonso a omis un dťtail.
Depuis vos fianÁailles,
Pritchard a tuť un fournisseur.
Restez vigilante
ou laissez tomber.
Disons que c'est un tueur.
Raison de plus
pour que je continue.
Je dois protťger ma fille.
Rien qu'une nuit.
Sauf si vous savez
oý a lieu le rendez-vous.
Votre fiancť
garde l'endroit secret.
Mais j'ai une idťe.
Vous Ítes dťmasquťe,
agent McGann.
Veratos a ťtť testť ici
au dťbut des annťes 80.
Si c'est une impasse, je casse
les 9 autres doigts de Giuseppe.
Áa me plairait !
Le fantasme
du prÍtre inaccessible !
Ouvrez la porte.
Elle semble sous pression.
Áa y est.
C'est un gaz !
Canari dans une mine de charbon !
Trouvez toutes les applications
possibles de ce gaz.
Je vais voir le pŤre Giuseppe.
Que Sydney vous examine.
- Pourquoi n'avoir rien dit ?
- Un agent ne sait pas tout.
Au cas oý
l'agent serait compromis !
L'agent a ťtť compromis !
Le dossier de Jenna
est dans le coffre de Pritchard.
Attendons que Pritchard
passe ŗ l'action.
S'il s'en prend ŗ Jenna,
vous la repÍcherez dans l'Hudson ?
Elle est prťvenue.
- Pardon ?
- C'est le boulot !
Et faire de sa fille
une orpheline ?
On surveillera Pritchard
C'est vous, le garde du corps !
Ce cran de sťcuritť obligatoire
est infernal.
C'est pas obligatoire.
J'ai aucune illusion
sur ce que je fais.
Ecoutez-moi.
Quand un type dťcide
d'acheter une mitraillette,
je lui offre pas les munitions.
Et s'il a de l'argent ŗ blanchir ?
Pardon ?
J'aime savoir qui je protŤge.
Savoir ne donne pas toujours
le pouvoir.
Dans mon cas, oui.
Jenna n'est pas
celle qu'elle prťtend.
C'est un agent des fraudes.
A qui l'avez-vous dit ?
Personne.
Vous aurez besoin d'aide
pour rompre les fianÁailles.
J'ai de l'expťrience
dans ce domaine.
Je vous l'ai dit.
Risquez votre peau
pour elle plutŰt que pour moi.
Vous Ítes amoureux d'elle ?
De ce qu'elle peut me donner.
La libertť.
Ce soir, une fois en sťcuritť,
je leur donnerai Fat Cat
et on s'achŤtera
une maison sur la plage
dans un pays tranquille.
- Si elle suit les ordres.
- Elle les suivra.
Un colt 91 1 ,
Áa peut Ítre trŤs convaincant.
J'ai mieux que Áa.
La fille de Jen.
Je vous l'ai dit,
j'ai aucune illusion
sur ce que je fais.
Tu connais mon avis.
Raines m'a parlť
du gaz Veratos.
Une confession.
ll n'en a jamais parlť.
C'est un tueur psychotique
qui mijote des horreurs.
- Les hommes sont leurs pťchťs ?
- Les mauvais, oui.
Ceux qui tripotent les filles
dans la basilique de Rome.
C'est faux et tu le sais.
ll s'agit pas de pelotage.
D'ailleurs, c'est toi qui voulais.
Tu m'en veux encore
de t'avoir repoussťe.
- C'est faux.
- Non, Parker.
Tu as rťťcrit l'histoire.
Tu te crťes un ennemi
pour pouvoir survivre.
La rage est ta religion.
ll te faut des ennemis
pour nourrir
ta foi pervertie.
Bl‚me celui qui t'offense.
S'il se repent, pardonne-lui.
ll a tuť ma mŤre.
ll est ŗ l'origine
de toute la douleur
de ma vie.
C'est un monstre !
Tu n'es pas son prÍtre,
mais son complice !
Pardonne-toi, Parker.
Sinon, tu es vouťe
ŗ une souffrance ťternelle.
Dieu pardonne. Moi pas.
Ne lui faites pas confiance.
ll ne lui fera rien.
Evitez ce risque.
Je dois aller avec lui ce soir.
Je dois finir
et mettre ce salaud en taule !
Ainsi, Cassie sera en sťcuritť.
Je suis dťcidťe.
- Et Jarod ?
- Je l'ai renvoyť chez lui.
Pourquoi ?
Chťri, j'ai un aveu ŗ te faire.
Croyez-moi.
Ne faites pas Áa.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Je sais que tu sais.
Taisez-vous !
Je t'aiderai ŗ quitter le pays.
Mais ne touche pas ŗ ma fille.
Dťgagez !
ll tuera quand mÍme votre fille !
Je ne tuerais pas une enfant.
Jarod... pardon.
Monte !
Tu sais quoi ? C'est drŰle.
Je suis vraiment tombť amoureux
de toi, bizarrement.
Et tu m'as brisť le coeur.
Mais tu as fait le bon choix.
En effet.
Vous m'avez ratť !
Une chanson
dit que le bonheur,
c'est un pistolet chaud.
Vous avez besoin
de vous rafraÓchir.
Tirer sur un ancien flic...
c'est pas malin.
Surtout s'il a chargť
votre arme ŗ blanc.
On a trouvť un fournisseur
d'armes mort dans les bois.
On n'a jamais identifiť l'arme...
ni le tueur.
Maintenant, c'est possible.
Tu veux que je te dise ?
Je tenais ŗ toi.
Mais il a fallu
que tu menaces ma fille !
Mauvaise idťe !
Le karma...
quelle saloperie, hein ?
lci Alonso.
Qu'avez-vous fait de Jenna ?
<i>Elle est en sťcuritť.</i>
Vous avez eu Fat Cat ?
<i>On le tient.</i>
Mais pas Pritchard.
lnspectez la 3e allťe
aprŤs la 1 8e rue.
Je vous ai laissť
un petit cadeau sous le siŤge.
On connaÓt les propriťtťs
du gaz Veratos.
ll dťtend progressivement
les poumons
au point de les empÍcher
de recevoir de l'oxygŤne.
A faibles doses,
ce n'est pas mortel.
Raines a ťludť cet aspect.
Áa peut Ítre liť
ŗ la mort subite du nourrisson.
Mon Dieu, le bťbť !
Ne le touchez pas !
Je sais, pour Veratos.
Áa m'ťtonnerait.
Une dose diluťe de Veratos
m'a permis
de rel‚cher ses poumons.
ll n'a plus besoin de ce boulet.
J'aimerais pouvoir
en dire autant de moi.
J'ai vu le laboratoire.
Les traÓtres
sont nombreux au Centre.
Vous avez besoin d'eux
pour survivre.
Mais je ne peux plus
Ítre votre ennemi.
L'Agneau de Dieu
libŤre le monde de ses pťchťs.
Heureux ceux qui partagent
le souper du Seigneur.
Le corps du Christ.
Que le Seigneur vous bťnisse.
Au nom du PŤre,
du Fils et du Saint-Esprit.
Allons en paix
pour aimer et servir le Seigneur.
- Tu as attrapť le mťchant ?
- On l'a eu.
Rentrons ŗ la maison.

Angelo perd les pédales.
ll passe en revue

ll est possédé !
ll a parlé ?
Beaucoup, mais sans logique.
Au feu !
Je l'ai dit, il est possédé.
Le feu brűle !
ll faut aider Jarod !
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- On doit sauver Jarod.
De quoi ?
Du feu. De la haine.
La haine tue.
La haine tuera Jarod.
On doit sauver Jarod.
Votre diagnostic, Freud ?
Selon moi, Angelo croit
que quelqu'un du passé de Jarod
va essayer de le tuer.
On doit sauver Jarod !
Reste ŕ savoir qui !
On a donné une bonne leçon
au révérend Jones !
Les effets spéciaux
aident ŕ comprendre.
Une croix enflammée
est drôlement efficace !
ll a vu la lumičre, hein ?
Si une image vaut mille mots,
une croix enflammée
vaut une gorgée !
On devrait interdire
de s'amuser autant.
En fait, je crois
que c'est interdit !
C'est mieux qu'ętre assureur.
Fętons ça !
Changement de programme !
- Un problčme ?
- Pendant que vous jouiez,
le Général a appelé.
Le Général ?
Pourquoi ?
ll sera lŕ
d'une minute ŕ l'autre.
Pourquoi ?
ll a une nouvelle mission.
Un message audacieux,
pas national, mais mondial.
- ça a l'air important.
- En effet.
ll veut tous vous voir.
On doit passer la nuit ici ?
- On doit rester ?
- Jusqu'ŕ son arrivée.
Vous venez d'autres Etats.
Le Général a peur
que vous vous fassiez repérer
en ville.
J'ai un petit cadeau du Général
pour faire passer notre message.
Des explosifs.
C'est sacrément puissant !
Exact !
Notre expert en démolition
va fabriquer
de quoi désunir
le Meeting de l'Unité !
Je vais vous dire un truc.
Quand ça sera fini,
la fęte durera un bail !
Cette folie dure depuis quand ?
On a organisé
un Meeting de l'Unité
pour rassembler les gens
de toutes classes sociales.
C'est lŕ qu'on a commencé
ŕ recevoir des menaces.
Quel genre ?
Des avertissements
pour qu'on annule le meeting.
Et quand vous avez refusé ?
C'est lŕ que les actes
de vandalisme ont commencé.
Le meeting a lieu demain.
Ces types sont dans le coin.
Et alors, shérif ?
ll faudrait tout annuler ?
C'est ce qu'ils veulent.
Reportez-le.
Pensez ŕ vos filles.
Quand j'avais 1 3 ans,
j'ai vu un homme battu
et personne n'a rien fait
pour le défendre.
Męme pas moi.
Cet homme a vécu trois jours.
Pendant lesquels
il a prié pour mourir.
Cet homme était mon grand frčre.
Ce genre de haine détruit
tout ce qu'elle touche.
C'est pour mes filles
que je fais ça.
Je participerai
au meeting de demain
avec ma paroisse et ma famille.
Du nouveau ?
Selon Angelo, une personne
que Jarod a fait juger
va tenter de le tuer.
On essaie de savoir qui
grâce aux éléments réunis
par le Centre.
Pas étonnant que quelqu'un
veuille tuer Jarod.
La liste est longue
et je suis en tęte.
La robe de la Veuve Noire !
Jarod l'a fait accuser
du meurtre de son mari.
Elle a déjŕ essayé de le tuer.
C'est elle ?
<i>Je veuX que ça s'arręte.</i>
<i>Je sais.</i>
<i>Je t'aime.</i>
Jarod est en danger !
Mais pas elle, pas une femme !
- ll sait ce qu'il fait ?
- Jarod ne sait pas.
Angelo évalue
systématiquement les individus
du passé de Jarod
qui le haďssent le plus.
Pas un mot ŕ Lyle et Raines.
lls gęneraient Angelo.
On a intéręt ŕ faire vite.
Les secrets ne durent pas ici.
Si Angelo isole le tueur potentiel,
il nous mčnera ŕ lui.
Et ŕ Jarod ?
A temps pour le sauver.
Et surtout pour l'attraper.
Eteins-moi ce truc !
Musique de sauvages !
On entend plus
que cette saloperie !
Tu as fini ?
Presque.
Veille ŕ ce que ça marche.
ça marchera.
T'as intéręt.
On va secouer
le Meeting de l'Unité !
Le Général dit que
quand le sang des fils de Caďn
coulera dans les caniveaux...
notre peuple sera uni.
Et tous les parasites
de la terre seront éliminés.
Amen, mon frčre !
<i>...transformé en oasis</i>
<i>de liberté et de justice.</i>
<i>J'ai un ręve !</i>
<i>Pourquoi haďr des gens</i>
<i>pour leur couleur ?</i>
<i>Je l'ignore.</i>
<i>ça s'appelle du racisme.</i>
<i>Tu dois savoir</i>
<i>ce qu'il eXiste de mal,</i>
<i>comme de bien.</i>
<i>Je ręve qu'un jour...</i>
<i>On leur apprend ça ?</i>
<i>D'une certaine façon, oui.</i>
<i>ll n'</i>y <i>a pas</i>
<i>de solution simple au racisme.</i>
S<i>i : cesser de haďr.</i>
<i>ll faut</i>
<i>du temps et de la compassion.</i>
<i>Tu comprends ça ?</i>
<i>Je comprends,</i>
<i>mais je ne peuX pas l'accepter.</i>
On dirait
que t'as vu un fantôme !
Non, mon frčre.
J'ai seulement vu la lumičre.
C'est fini.
Le Général sera pas déçu !
Je vais emporter ça en ville
pour que tout soit pręt
pour demain.
ça m'étonnerait.
Personne ne bouge
avant l'arrivée du Général.
ça éveillerait les soupçons.
Je m'en occupe.
Finis de remplir les cartouches.
ll était prévu que je place
tous les explosifs.
Le programme a changé,
gros malin.
Ordres du Général.
Ce coup-lŕ est particulier.
Les filles du pręcheur
seront le message.
ll veut qu'on les tue ?
ll va mettre fin
ŕ ces conneries d'unité.
J'ai essayé tous les moyens
de contacter Jarod. Rien.
Angelo a une piste.
- Qu'il trouve pas les balles !
- L'arme était ŕ un gangster.
Joey Molino a tué un flic
et Jarod l'a démasqué.
En prison,
il paraît que Joey est furieux.
ll veut peut-ętre
faire tuer Jarod.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Danger ! Mort ! Haine !
La haine se rapproche de Jarod.
Jarod ne veut pas de haine,
il ne veut pas tuer.
Mais quelqu'un veut tuer Jarod !
<i>Tu pensais que</i>
<i>je découvrirais pas qui tu es ?</i>
<i>T'es mort !</i>
<i>T'entends ? T'es mort !</i>
<i>Rafraîchissez-vous les idées.</i>
<i>Je te donnerai</i>
<i>tout ce que tu voudras.</i>
S<i>alut !</i>
Est-ce que c'est Joey ?
Pas Joey. Quelqu'un déteste
encore plus Jarod.
On doit vite trouver.
On tourne en rond.
Jarod mourra !
Patience, Parker.
Angelo élimine les suspects.
ll faut trouver vite
ou Jarod mourra.
On n'a pas le temps
d'ętre patients.
Dépęche-toi.
On veut un perdant de plus !
Tu triches depuis le début.
Comme tout le monde.
- Qui triche ?
- Delbert.
Qu'est-ce que tu as ?
Laisse tomber.
Double paire.
Oů tu vas ?
Rajouter un peu de poudre
autour de la bombe.
Pour un meilleur impact visuel.
Le Général veut du napalm.
Discute pas !
C'est son projet, sa cause.
On obéit.
ça te défrise ?
Non, j'aime savoir
ce qui se passe, c'est tout.
Tu bouges pas d'ici.
Ordres du Général.
Luke ?
Nouveau message du Général.
- Un problčme ?
- En fait, oui.
L'un de nous est pas
celui qu'il prétend.
ll y a un traître.
Personne doit partir
avant son arrivée.
Rentrez, les gars.
On réglera ça avec le Général.
Que Dieu bénisse Kati et papa.
Et que Dieu bénisse maman
au ciel.
C'est l'heure de vous coucher.
Reposez votre voix pour demain.
Pourquoi ces gens nous détestent ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on a fait ?
Approchez-vous.
Vous n'avez rien fait de mal.
Rien du tout.
Les gens haďssent...
parce qu'ils ont peur.
Peur de ce qu'ils ignorent,
de ce qu'ils ne comprennent pas.
C'est pour ça que ce meeting
est important. Compris ?
C'est sűr ?
Alors, au lit !
Dormez bien.
Je vous aime.
Tu peux fermer la fenętre ?
Bien sűr, chérie.
Avec le verrou.
Voilŕ, j'ai mis le verrou.
Bonne nuit.
Du nouveau sur Jarod ?
On dirait un samedi soir
chez Broots !
Angelo entre dans la peau
du capitaine Saunders.
ll risque entre 20 ans
et la perpétuité, grâce ŕ Jarod.
Le capitaine Robert Saunders.
Un vrai cas d'école.
Ainsi qu'un violeur et un tueur.
ll a le profil, c'est sűr.
ll a juré de se venger de Jarod.
Jarod choisit bien ses ennemis !
ll a tendance
ŕ emmerder les gens.
Saunders...
déteste Jarod !
Veut faire souffrir Jarod !
<i>Vous semblez avoir peur,</i>
S<i>aunders.</i>
<i>Qui est lŕ ?</i>
<i>Les démons de votre esprit.</i>
<i>C'est vous,</i> S<i>tevens ?</i>
<i>J'</i>y <i>vais. Amusez-vous bien</i>
<i>dans votre petit...</i>
<i>enfer.</i>
<i>Ne partez pas !</i>
<i>Laissez-moi sortir !</i>
Saunders déteste Jarod,
mais ce n'est pas lui.
Quelqu'un déteste
encore plus Jarod.
On a du mal ŕ imaginer pire.
Vite !
Le temps presse !
Du calme !
Je l'ai jamais vu comme ça.
Peux pas me calmer !
Quelqu'un déteste Jarod !
Déteste aussi Mlle Parker !
Le voilŕ.
Vire ces bouteilles de bičre.
Content de vous voir.
Tout est pręt pour demain,
aucun d'entre nous n'est parti.
On vous aidera
ŕ trouver le traître.
C'est inutile.
Pas vrai, Jarod ?
<i>Ne restez pas lŕ, coupez ça !</i>
<i>Le faire m'a pris du temps.</i>
S<i>ortez-moi de lŕ</i>
<i>ou je vous bute !</i>
<i>Votre chargeur est vide.</i>
<i>Le c</i>y<i>clone va arriver.</i>
<i>Vous ętes mort, espčce de...</i>
ça remonte ŕ longtemps, hein ?
On s'est connus
pendant un cyclone.
Mais cette tempęte n'est rien
par rapport ŕ ma rage.
Reprenons notre programme.
Bartlett a essayé
de tuer Jarod... et vous.
ll a failli réussir.
J'avais localisé Jarod
et on a été pris
dans un cyclone.
Le filet avec lequel
Jarod l'a capturé !
ça n'a pas suffi
pour neutraliser Bartlett.
<i>Chéri, je suis lŕ !</i>
Bartlett !
C'est lui qui va tuer Jarod ?
ll faut arręter Bartlett.
ll déteste Jarod, tout le monde.
Bartlett veut tuer
Jarod.
Aidez Jarod.
On doit agir, Parker.
Voyez si Bartlett
est toujours en prison.
Bartlett est une ordure raciste
qui tuerait sa propre mčre.
ll faut qu'on le trouve.
Si Bartlett
trouve Jarod le premier,
il le tuera.
Et gâchera mes chances.
Prions pour qu'il soit
encore temps.
Les voies du Seigneur
sont impénétrables.
ll s'est servi de toi
pour me jeter en prison.
Mais par Sa divine providence,
j'ai été libéré
afin de réunir mon peuple
et purifier ce pays.
Et te voilŕ,
un don du ciel !
Quel malade !
Votre haine vous détruira
et détruira vos proches.
Je suis pas malade,
mais incompris.
Persécuté comme les prophčtes,
mais pas malade.
On fait quoi ?
Je vais le juger dans les bois.
Ne vous salissez pas les mains.
Laissez-moi faire. Ce sera
un honneur de punir ce Judas.
Un apôtre !
Fais ça prčs du ruisseau
et laisse-le lŕ-bas.
Tu retourneras en poussičre.
On a du boulot pour demain !
Plein de gens
chanteront le blues.
Emmčne-le.
On y va !
Mets-toi ŕ genoux !
Ne fais pas ça !
T'as pas eu trop peur,
j'espčre ?
Je dois vérifier mon pantalon,
mais je suis vivant.
Police de Géorgie.
Répression des fraudes.
On cherche Bartlett
depuis l'annulation
de son jugement pour meurtre.
Je parie que c'est toi
qui l'avais coincé.
Coupable.
J'ignorais qu'on le libérerait.
Tu as une idée ?
Non, je suis coupé de l'extérieur.
On peut le coffrer pour complot.
Prenons-le en flagrant délit,
ce sera la perpétuité.
ll va tuer
les filles du pasteur.
Tiens.
Retourne le voir,
tiens-lui compagnie.
J'aviserai.
Bonne chance.
ll a pas supplié.
Pas trop.
Dommage,
ça gâche un peu le plaisir.
Je le savais !
Jarod a croisé
les fils du détonateur.
C'est pas joli ?
Une petite bombe et du napalm,
le message sera clair.
Dites-moi oů vous voulez
que je la pose.
C'est ma vision, ma cause.
- On le fera ensemble.
- Non.
J'agirai seul.
Préparez-vous pour demain,
préparez-vous ŕ la guerre.
<i>J'ai quelqu'un ŕ te présenter.</i>
<i>Tu es... une fille.</i>
<i>Pourquoi tu m'as sauvé la vie ?</i>
<i>Parce que je me souviens encore</i>
<i>de la petite fille</i>
<i>qui m'a donné</i>
<i>mon premier baiser.</i>
Bartlett a été libéré de prison.
Pour vice de forme, je parie !
Exactement.
En prison, il a créé
une faction raciste.
ll est en Géorgie
pour s'opposer ŕ un meeting.
Partons arręter cet enfoiré
et attraper Jarod.
Repentez-vous !
Qui chante le blues, maintenant ?
J'en ai marre de toi,
tu es increvable !
Mais c'est terminé.
Cette fois,
mon chargeur est plein.
Navré de vous décevoir.
Devinez qui a chargé
les cartouches ?
J'ai dű me tromper.
Au fait,
je vous dois ça.
Réveillez-vous !
C'est quoi ?
La croix que vous devez porter.
Puisque vous aimez
brűler des croix
et terroriser des innocents,
j'ai décidé de vous faire
goűter ŕ la terreur.
Comme vous comptiez faire
ŕ ces fillettes !
Je veux pas les effrayer,
mais les tuer !
C'est marrant !
On a déjŕ vécu ça.
Tu me feras rien.
Tu manques d'estomac !
Pas comme la salope
qui t'accompagnait.
C'est pas d'estomac
dont j'ai besoin...
mais d'une autre partie
de mon anatomie.
Et croyez-moi, ça, j'en ai !
Tu t'en tireras pas.
J'ai Luke et les gars !
Luke !
Vous ętes moins malin
que vous croyez.
ll y avait deux traîtres
dans le groupe.
Luke appartient
ŕ la police de Géorgie.
Vos autres apôtres
sont déjŕ ŕ l'ombre.
Tu peux crever !
Non, vous !
Tu peux pas faire ça !
Ne fais pas ça ! Au secours !
Je veux pas mourir !
Ne me brűle pas vif !
Je regrette !
Je veux pas mourir !
Je t'en supplie !
Pas comme ça !
Je veux pas mourir !
Au secours !
Je regrette !
Seigneur, je T'en prie !
Vous avez raison.
J'ai pas assez d'estomac
pour tuer.
Ni de haine.
Ce sera marrant...
de moisir en prison.
<i>Pose ton fardeau</i>
<i>Ouvre ton coeur</i>
<i>Pose ton fardeau</i>
<i>La guérison fera ton bonheur</i>
<i>ll nous a bénis et guidés</i>
<i>A travers l'éternité</i>
<i>Pose ton fardeau</i>
<i>Et va vers la liberté...</i>
Arrętez ou je vous envoie
dans l'au-delŕ illico !
ça me rappelle
quand j'allais ŕ l'église
avec mon cousin,
quand j'étais petit.
Merci d'ętre venus.
On manque de places assises.
On n'est pas lŕ pour prier.
Je suis le révérend Jones.
Nous cherchons cet homme.
ll s'appelle Jarod.
ll serait męlé ŕ un conflit
avec un raciste dénommé Bartlett.
Navré, je ne l'ai jamais vu.
Si vous voulez voir Bartlett,
essayez la prison.
J'espčre que cette fois,
il y passera.
Je prie pour que Bartlett décide
de mettre fin ŕ une vie de haine
pour céder la place
ŕ l'amour et la miséricorde.
Priez pour nous tous.
Dieu vous bénisse.
Merci infiniment.
On s'en va. Leur ange gardien
n'a fait qu'une apparition.

NlCE FELLOW
Après la cérémonie,
vous irez à l'hôtel.
J'ai aussi contacté
un agent immobilier.
- Ecoute-moi.
- Je suis occupé.
Qui est-ce ?
Pas maintenant.
Toutes mes excuses.
Excusez-moi.
Bienvenue. Vous allez
commencer une vie fascinante
en tant que citoyens américains.
Levez la main droite
et répétez.
''Je jure solennellement...
''que je renonce totalement
et que j'abjure...
''toute allégeance et fidélité
''à un pays étranger...''
Madame !
Veuillez appeler la sécurité !
Restez calmes !
Dirigez-vous
vers la sortie la plus proche !
Restez calmes !
Vous avez vu le visage
de cette malheureuse ?
Elle est aveugle,
mais elle semblait avoir vu
le diable en personne.
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>à cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>ll défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
J'ai une image
de la porte d'entrée.
ll est inscrit
sous le nom de Ki Mak.
ça fait thaï.
Cambodgien.
Voyez ce que ça donne
sur lnterpol.
ll est tatoué.
Sur la main. Un serpent
qui se mord la queue.
Je le note.
Un coup de Lyle ?
C'est certain.
Mais que mijote-t-il ?
Que toutes les factures
soient signées.
Services d'immigration.
On ne peut pas expulser quelqu'un
qui vend des cigarettes
trop cher.
Changez de boutique.
C'est pas une blague,
c'est l'Amérique.
Vous désirez ?
Agent Jarod Ellis.
Je cherche une aveugle.
- Qui vous envoie ?
- Washington.
Votre service nous a appelés.
Quel agent ?
Rinker.
Mike ?
Jack.
Jack Rinker est encore là ?
ll est parti.
Essayez son portable.
J'abandonne.
Elle dit son nom
et la même chose sans cesse.
Je parle 5 langues asiatiques
- mais ça m'échappe.
- Elle a soif.
- Elle veut de l'eau.
- Vous parlez cambodgien ?
Comme tout le monde.
J'ai Jack Rinker en ligne.
Je vous le passe ?
Souhaitez-lui
de bonnes vacances.
Elle est à vous.
<i>Vous parlez ma langue ?</i>
<i>Pas très bien.</i>
<i>La bibliothèque avait peu</i>
<i>de livres sur le sujet.</i>
On peut essayer en anglais ?
Parlez-moi de la cérémonie.
Je veux votre bien.
2e visite surprise de Washington !
- 2e ?
- L'agent Jarod Ellis.
1 ,80 m, 80 kg,
bruns aux yeux marrons ?
- Vous le connaissez ?
- Un peu.
Votre carte ?
Agent Greene et agent Hill,
division interne.
Tout cela est très déroutant.
Mais je dois savoir
ce qui se passe.
Vous n'avez cessé de répéter
le mot ''boucher''
à la cérémonie.
Pourquoi ?
Où est-il ?
Dernière salle d'interrogatoire
au fond du couloir.
Mince !
ll faut s'occuper d'elle
sans tarder.
Je ne comprends pas.
La femme que vous avez vue ce matin
est malheureusement
liée à mon passé.
Et maintenant, au vôtre.
Je comprends votre inquiétude.
Mais elle est aveugle.
Sous-estimer les faibles a mis
plus d'une armée à genoux.
Nous avons une excellente armée.
Vous l'avez trouvée ?
Non, l'aveugle a été enlevée.
Par qui ?
Jarod.
Dites à vos soldats
que c'est la guerre.
Laissez-moi vous aider.
Une photo de votre famille ?
Mère...
père... frère.
Où sont-ils ?
Morts.
Tous assassinés par le Boucher.
Mak arrive du Venezuela.
En quoi est-il lié à Lyle ?
Lyle a fait
trois voyages d'affaires
à Caracas l'année dernière.
ll semble que le Centre
n'ait aucun lien avec ce pays.
Pas officiellement.
ll y a autre chose.
J'étais aux W-C
et j'ai entendu dire que Willie
avait raté Jarod de peu.
- Où ?
- W-C du niveau souterrain 1 0.
La rencontre avec Jarod, nigaud !
En Virginie.
De l'autre côté du fleuve.
Willie fait temporairement partie
de l'équipe de Lyle.
Où allez-vous ?
Discuter avec mon petit frère.
<i>Tous assassinés par le Boucher.</i>
<i>Epicerie Li Ho</i>
Pressé ?
Très.
Pourquoi un citoyen cambodgien
vivrait au Venezuela ?
Peut-être pour le climat
ou pour le café.
Ou bien parce que...
le Venezuela
n'a pas d'accords d'extradition ?
Tu as quelque chose en tête ?
Qui est Ki Mak ?
Pourquoi le doberman de Raines
le dorlote ?
Tu ne devrais pas
traquer Jarod ?
C'est drôle que tu dises ça,
vu que tes hommes
l'ont raté de peu aujourd'hui.
Je peux être seul ?
Parle ou je mets mon pied
dans la gorge de Willie.
Mak appartenait
aux Combattants de la Liberté.
ll a fui
après la chute de Saigon.
ll s'est caché pour survivre.
Que fait-il ici ?
ll m'a rendu un service
en Thaïlande il y a 5 ans.
J'ai promis
de lui renvoyer l'ascenseur.
Pour Jarod, c'était un hasard.
Continue.
Mak avait besoin d'un parrain
pour sa naturalisation.
Je lui ai trouvé un poste
d'attaché culturel.
Je te conseille
de te concentrer
sur Jarod et de me lâcher
avant que je perde patience.
Une menace ?
A ton avis ?
Vous devez adorer les dates.
En fait, c'est pour une amie.
Ce chapelet appartient à...
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Un ami de Kim Chay.
J'ai des questions à vous poser.
J'ai fait ça
pour les Cambodgiens d'ici.
Un petit morceau
de ce qu'on a laissé.
Venez dans l'arrière-boutique.
Mon pays est beau,
mais il a souffert.
La guerre contre l'Amérique,
le génocide de Pol Pot.
Le chef des Khmers rouges.
Asseyez-vous.
25 ans ont passé, mais je sens
encore l'odeur de chair brûlée.
Je garde ça pour me rappeler
de quoi l'homme est capable.
Kim Chay a été torturée
par les Khmers rouges.
Pire que ça, hélas.
Mon frère
vivait dans son village.
Les soldats sont arrivés
chez Kim Chay.
Son père, sa mère, son frère...
ont été tués devant elle.
Elle n'est pas née aveugle.
ll paraît
qu'elle a attaqué l'officier
pour sauver sa famille...
et qu'elle a fait couler
son sang...
à mains nues.
Elle avait 6 ans.
C'est lui ?
C'est le colonel Chen Thon,
officier des Khmers rouges.
Un monstre assassin.
Vous avez été témoin
de ces meurtres ?
Le seul témoin est Kim Chay.
Des officiers
ont fui vers le Triangle d'Or
et ont fait fortune
dans le trafic d'héroïne.
Si le colonel Thon est ici...
la vie de Kim Chay est en danger.
Et je crains
que la vôtre aussi.
Mak doit comparaître
devant les autorités portuaires.
Vous y serez ?
Lyle sait que Jarod
est son meilleur atout,
mais semble vouloir honorer
une promesse datant de 5 ans.
- Donc ?
- Tout ça va très loin.
Et ce Mak est la clé.
Jarod fera peut-être
une apparition surprise.
On dirait
que Mak est tombé du ciel.
Ni extrait de naissance
ni dossiers scolaires.
ça peut disparaître.
Ou être effacé.
J'ai voulu rouvrir un fichier
pour vérifier. ll avait disparu.
Effacé. Comme si l'histoire
de cet homme...
Etait gommée.
Lyle ?
ll a connu Mak en Thaïlande.
Broots, analysez cette photo.
Ciblez le Sud-Est asiatique :
livres,
magazines, journaux.
Vite, il peut disparaître
avant qu'on l'identifie.
Vous ne voulez pas
parler du passé,
mais je ne renoncerai pas.
Je n'ai jamais eu de foyer.
Je sais ce que sont
la douleur et le deuil.
Parlez-moi de votre cécité.
C'était pendant l'année zéro.
Pol Pot et ses hommes
voulaient arrêter Thon,
entamer une guerre
pour obtenir le pouvoir.
lls ont commencé
par tuer les professeurs...
puis les chefs spirituels
et enfin, les artistes.
Votre mère et votre père.
lls écrivaient de la poésie.
Des textes
qui réconfortaient les gens.
Le colonel Thon a fait lire
à mon père un de ses propres livres
et l'a tué,
ainsi que le reste
de ma famille.
C'est ce jour-là
que le soleil a disparu.
Je veux vous aider
à le faire revenir.
Je dois examiner vos yeux.
Vous voulez bien ?
Je sens votre douleur
et votre solitude.
Vous avez perdu
beaucoup d'êtres chers.
<i>lci</i> Sy<i>dne</i>y.
Les yeux de Kim Chay ne présentent
aucun signe de maladie.
Vous connaissez
le silence de la terreur ?
Des cas apparus après les bombes
sur Hiroshima et Nagasaki.
<i>Les hôpitauX ont vu des patients</i>
incapables de communiquer.
Sans présenter
d'affection physiologique.
C'est une réaction psychosomatique
à ce qu'ils ont vu.
Je crois que c'est ce dont
souffre Kim Chay.
L'esprit humain est capable
de presque tout pour se protéger.
Elle ne mérite pas
de vivre dans le noir.
Que dois-je faire ?
Les patients réagissent parfois
face à l'objet de leur terreur.
Attention,
<i>si on la pousse trop, elle peut</i>
<i>rester dans l'obscurité.</i>
Au fait, Mlle Parker pense
traverser le fleuve
<i>cet après-midi. Elle s'intéresse</i>
<i>à la politique locale.</i>
Une certaine audience au port,
plus précisément.
<i>ça peut t'intéresser.</i>
Enormément.
Vous souffrez
de troubles de conversion.
Je ne comprends pas.
Quand une personne
subit un traumatisme,
ça peut se manifester
de façon physiologique.
Dans votre cas, la cécité.
Cela peut se soigner ?
Je crois que oui, mais...
ll faut affronter
l'élément déclencheur.
C'est-à-dire le colonel Thon.
ll restera libre
si vous n'intervenez pas.
Le monde est plein de beauté.
Ne laissez pas ce monstre
vous en priver.
J'ai vécu tant d'années
avec cet homme,
à essayer d'effacer son visage.
Je ne peux pas
faire revenir ce monstre.
Je regrette.
On trouvera un autre moyen.
J'ai trouvé un article sur Mak
dans un journal thaïlandais.
Une histoire vieille de 5 ans.
Son vrai nom est Chen Thon.
C'était une huile
parmi les communistes.
Lyle a menti. Quelle surprise !
Alors ?
Je n'ai pas fait traduire,
puisque vous comprenez.
Pas tout, mais il semble
que Lyle ait été arrêté
pour l'agression
de deux prostituées.
Mais qu'est-ce qui cloche
chez lui ?
Le meurtre de Chay Lin,
les soeurs à la fac,
la chambre de torture...
et maintenant, ça ?
ça va ?
Très bien.
<i>Je suis désolée.</i>
Je n'ai pas besoin d'excuses.
Effacez toute trace
du passé de Thon.
Que les fournisseurs thaïlandais
soient prêts.
M. Mak aimerait vous voir.
ll a du nouveau
sur la femme de la cérémonie.
ll attend dans sa voiture.
Votre robe est ravissante.
Merci, monsieur.
Où est Mak ?
Désolé.
ll y a un changement de programme.
Tu pensais que j'allais
te laisser en paix ?
Enlève ce truc de ma tête !
Assez !
Tu ne t'en tireras pas,
on va me chercher.
Tu parles de Thon ?
Je ne vais pas laisser
ce tueur cinglé en liberté !
C'est réglé.
La commission portuaire !
Pas bête, comme idée.
Tu fais nommer
un type à la commission
pour importer librement
de l'héroïne depuis l'Asie !
ll s'agit seulement d'affaires.
Mais ce type a massacré
des milliers d'innocents !
Tu connais ma philosophie.
Je ne veux rien savoir.
Tu ne peux pas aller
à cette audience.
Mlle Parker enverra une armée.
Voilà qui pourrait poser
un problème !
Et voilà !
Tu veux quoi ?
Du temps.
Je vais appeler Mlle Parker.
Tu diras que tu m'as capturé.
Tu donneras cette adresse.
Elle descendra cet escalier
et trébuchera
sur ce fil.
Tu peux deviner la suite.
Et si je refuse ?
Tu n'as pas le choix.
Quand tu me torturais au Centre,
j'avais recours à une technique...
pour bloquer la douleur physique.
Je devais m'évader par l'esprit.
Toi, en revanche,
tu maîtrises mal
cette technique de survie.
Je me trompe ?
lntimidant, non ?
Un fermier du Montana
s'en servait pour son bétail.
Tu te dis que c'est différent.
Tu as raison,
le bétail ne le méritait pas.
On passe ce coup de fil ?
Lecture intéressante ?
Vous n'en croyez pas vos yeux ?
Je vous connais depuis toujours.
Je sais
quand vous cachez quelque chose.
On ne peut pas en dire autant
des gens du même sang.
ll ne s'agit pas d'agression,
mais d'un double meurtre.
Lyle était le suspect nl1 .
Selon l'article, il a eu recours
à une source militaire
pour acheter la police.
Le colonel Thon.
Mais ce n'est pas tout ?
Ces filles n'ont pas été
seulement tuées.
Elles ont été mutilées.
On leur a...
enlevé certains organes.
Tu es sûr ?
Compris.
J'arrive !
C'était Lyle.
ll a capturé Jarod.
Je déclare ouverte
cette session portuaire.
ll s'agit aujourd'hui
de nommer M. Ki Mak
attaché culturel
de la commission portuaire.
Bonjour.
Mme Owen, messieurs.
J'ai votre dossier
et en 23 ans de carrière
dans ce comité,
je n'ai jamais vu
autant de recommandations.
Toute ma vie a été consacrée
à servir mon prochain.
Je crois que chacun de nous
a une chance de se distinguer.
Nous avons le devoir
de faire de notre mieux.
S'il n'y a pas d'objections,
je suggère
que nous passions au vote.
Très mauvaise idée.
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Peu importe.
C'est cet homme
que vous devriez identifier.
Pour vous, il s'agit de Ki Mak,
humanitaire, père de famille.
Mais c'est en fait
le colonel Thon.
Et son héritage se résume
au génocide de milliers de gens !
Connaissez-vous cet homme ?
De quoi parle-t-il ?
Ma vie est un livre ouvert
devant vous.
Je pense que cet homme
me confond avec un autre.
Ce qui est confondant,
c'est de vous voir vivant.
Le colonel Thon
dirigeait une division d'élite
responsable du massacre
d'innocents.
Des hommes, des femmes
et des enfants.
C'est insensé ! Qu'il sorte...
Si vous suspendez la procédure
le temps d'ouvrir une enquête,
vous mettrez fin
à une vie de torture !
Qu'avez-vous à dire, M. Mak ?
L'Amérique reste
le dernier espoir de la liberté.
Une liberté pour laquelle
mes compatriotes
se sont battus.
J'ajoute
que si je suis le monstre
que l'on m'accuse d'être,
qu'une voix, une personne
vienne prouver
que je suis coupable.
Entendu.
Cela n'a aucune valeur
sans témoin oculaire.
Quelqu'un peut-il confirmer
ces horribles accusations ?
Moi.
Vous êtes ?
Je m'appelle Kim Chay.
Je suis née
au nord du Cambodge.
Cet homme est responsable
de l'assassinat
de ma mère, mon père
et mon frère.
Vous en avez été témoin ?
Vous confirmez
que l'homme qui se trouve ici
est bien le colonel Thon ?
C'est ridicule.
Cette femme est aveugle.
Comment peut-elle m'identifier ?
Pendant des années,
j'ai vécu dans l'obscurité,
par crainte du souvenir
de votre visage.
Je n'aurai plus peur.
C'est l'homme... qui a tué
ma mère, mon père et mon frère.
Voici son sang
qu'une enfant terrifiée
de 6 ans a fait couler.
Moi.
Nous allons fermer le bâtiment
en attendant que les autorités
emmènent l'accusé.
Vous avez passé la nuit
coincée avec M. Lyle.
ll y a de quoi être en rogne.
Et Jarod vous a encore eue.
A croire que ce type
entre dans la tête des gens !
ll anticipe toutes vos décisions.
Du balai !
J'ai trouvé le sens
du tatouage de Thon.
Félicitations.
C'est le symbole cambodgien
du cannibalisme.
Si tu penses sauter,
monte sur le toit
et fais ça bien.
Tu ne sais toujours pas
frapper à la porte.
Quelle sale mine !
J'ai mal dormi cette nuit.
Je me demandais pourquoi
Jarod n'avait pas fini
son travail. Maintenant, je sais.
Pour maintenir le suspense.
C'est vrai, il y a tant...
de secrets croustillants
qui restent...
à savourer.
Pas très flatteur, hein ?
Tu as tué ces filles.
Et vu l'oeuvre d'art
sur ton bras, j'imagine
ce qui est arrivé ensuite.
Tu n'as pas fini l'article,
j'ai été innocenté.
Quant au tatouage,
c'en est un parmi d'autres.
Tu veux voir ?
Tu t'es servi d'un criminel
de guerre pour sortir de prison.
Tu t'es activée
comme une fourmi, dis donc !
Disons par exemple
que j'ai commis les horreurs
dont tu m'accuses. Prouve-le !
J'ai Mak.
Ou plutôt le colonel Thon.
Je lui proposerai de mettre
tes péchés psycho-pathétiques
sur un plateau.
Sans faire de jeu de mots !
Et à qui
donneras-tu cette information ?
Au Triumvirat, pour commencer.
lls seront sûrement ravis
d'apprendre
qu'un tueur en série cannibale
dirige leur organisation.
Je passe un accord avec Thon
et tu es cuit !
Le colonel serait intéressé
par ton offre...
à condition de pouvoir l'entendre.
Tu n'as pas lu le journal,
ce matin ?
On parle d'accident tragique.
Je préfère voir ça
comme du karma.
Je raffole des restes. Pas toi ?
Mon Dieu... Tu es fou !
''J'accepte cette obligation
librement...
''sans aucune réserve...
''ni intention d'évasion...
''Que Dieu me vienne en aide.''
Félicitations ! Vous voilà tous
citoyens américains !
Vous êtes venu !
Je n'aurais raté ça pour rien
au monde. Que ressentez-vous ?
L'impression d'avoir un foyer.
Vous savez que Thon
est mort dans un accident ?
J'ai vu le journal,
mais vous vous trompez.
ll est mort quand vous m'avez
donné la force de l'affronter.
Qu'est-ce qui vous a fait
changer d'avis ?
Un ami m'a rappelé
que le monde était plein de beauté.
Merci, Jarod.
Je vous souhaite
de pouvoir faire revenir
la lumière dans votre vie.
Merci.

NlCE FELLOW
C'est le dernier repaire de Jarod.
- ll est parti depuis quand ?
- Environ 24 h.
Les nettoyeurs fouillent l'endroit.
Toujours le mÍme refrain.
Qui est le binoclard ?
Le Dr Guchi Tuchen.
Le nouveau chef des nettoyeurs.
- Un C V en or.
- ll vient de Calcutta.
Rappelez-moi d'annuler
la viande ŗ NoŽl.
L'inf‚me Mlle Parker.
- Pardonnez-moi de ne pas me lever.
- Aucun problŤme.
Le petit gťnie
nous a laissť quoi, cette fois ?
Je crains que ce soit
un peu dťroutant.
Comment Áa ?
Tenez.
Du PCP.
Ridicule.
Jarod ne se drogue pas.
Navrť de vous contredire.
Nous avons analysť le sang
restant sur les seringues.
C'est celui de Jarod.
Avec ce qu'il a subi,
la toxicomanie n'est pas ŗ ťcarter.
- Jarod, un junkie ?
- On a aussi trouvť ceci.
- L'ťcriture de Jarod.
- ll a laissť Áa par accident ?
ll plane peut-Ítre
sous l'effet de la drogue.
On en a un
qui se cache dans l'immeuble.
ll faut l'enfermer.
Oý en est votre assurance ?
- A jour.
- On vous fera pas de mal.
On vient vous aider.
Allons-y en douceur.
Maman !
Maman !
Papa !
Les laissez pas m'emmener !
<i>On m'a enlevť ŗ ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble dťjŗ</i>
<i>plus douť que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>ŗ cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon ťvasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passť.</i>
<i>C'est un Camťlťon.</i>
<i>Un gťnie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De prťfťrence.</i>
<i>ll dťfend les opprimťs.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous Ítes mťdecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
- Qui c'est ?
- Un chieur.
Surveillez-le.
Bienvenue ŗ Vista House, M. Jones.
Dr Earl, votre psychologue.
Je suis ici pour vous aider
ŗ aller mieux.
Vous seul pouvez dťcider
d'arrÍter.
Vťrifie son sac.
M. Jones, vous devez signer Áa.
C'est quoi ?
Une dťcharge nous autorisant
ŗ vous enfermer.
M'enfermer ?
Je dťteste Ítre enfermť.
C'est nťcessaire durant
la 1 re phase du sevrage.
C'est sťvŤre,
mais notre taux de rťussite
est lŗ.
Merci.
- Alors ?
- VÍtements de rechange,
peignoir, portefeuille,
48 $ en liquide.
Un cahier rouge.
- Je tiens un journal.
- Parfait.
Votre cure consistera ŗ ťcrire
et ŗ vous pencher sur vous-mÍme.
Attends !
Nous avons un code d'ťthique.
Le cercle de confiance.
Vous gagnez notre confiance,
elle vous revient
avec des avantages.
Trahissez la confiance
et le cercle est rompu.
Vous Ítes prťvenu.
Je me sens mal.
Apporte-lui une cuvette.
''Cherche homme exceptionnel.
Si vous Ítes beau,
''stable et aguerri
aux leÁons de la vie,
''nous avons des points communs.''
Áa fait quoi,
d'Ítre le roi des losers ?
Je lis Áa pour m'amuser.
C'est Áa.
Du nouveau
sur le dernier indice de Jarod ?
''1 0-1 7-76'' est une rťfťrence
au 1 7 octobre 1 976.
''A-22'', je ne sais pas.
22 avril, 22 aoŻt
ou niveau souterrain 22.
ArrÍtez de lire les annonces...
Áa alors !
Quoi ?
C'est mon jour de chance.
''A-22'' : section A, page 22.
Allez chercher le microfilm
du 1 7 octobre 1 976.
On saura peut-Ítre pourquoi Jarod
est accro ŗ l'hťro.
Áa va ?
Je suis guťri.
Je veux sortir.
Les mťdecins sont les gťnťraux
sur la colline
qui regardent la bataille.
Je suis un troufion.
Je veille sur mes potes.
Tu seras mon pote ?
- Pourquoi pas ?
- Bonne rťponse.
Je t'apporterai tes repas,
ferai tes analyses,
laverai tes sapes,
mÍme ton vomi,
si t'es sympa avec moi.
Tu vas en baver, ici,
mais je peux t'aider.
Dťsolť.
Je suis en manque !
Tu vois ce type ?
C'est pas mon pote.
On fait une pause pipi.
Tiens. Remplis-moi Áa.
Un peu d'intimitť !
Tu tiens le flacon ?
C'est pas un quatre ťtoiles,
mais t'aurais pas les moyens.
ll fait froid.
Attends d'avoir
tes bouffťes de chaleur.
Tu as une cuvette.
Tu en auras besoin.
J'y arriverai pas.
Donnez-moi quelque chose.
Pour m'aider, vous comprenez ?
Juste pour ce soir !
J'y arriverai pas !
Me laissez pas lŗ !
Allez, cul sec.
<i>Une mŤre toXico</i>
<i>perd la garde de son fils</i>
<i>femme disparue retrouvťe</i>
<i>inconsciente dans un parc</i>
ll y a un nouveau.
Voici Jarod.
Bienvenue au Hilton de l'hťro.
Merci, Huey.
Dites-nous ce qui vous amŤne.
Un gros flic
qui puait de la gueule.
TrŤs malin.
Vous pouvez Ítre plus prťcis ?
Tu nous apprendras
rien de nouveau.
Disons que je traverse
une petite crise d'identitť.
Aujourd'hui, nous parlerons
de la responsabilitť.
Nous refusons de nous sentir
responsables de notre toxicomanie.
Nous prťfťrons accuser
le reste du monde.
Je vais vous dire un truc.
Si jamais je replongeais,
j'accuserais Jill.
- La ferme.
- Elle me rend dingue,
ŗ chialer sans arrÍt,
ŗ propos de sa dťfonce
la semaine derniŤre :
''Je suis clean,
je sais pas ce qui s'est passť !''
C'est la vťritť.
C'est Áa, l'hťro.
C'est pas censť Ítre
un groupe de soutien ?
Elle avait des opiacťes
dans le sang.
Elle ment en disant
qu'elle a rien pris.
- Je mens pas.
- Menteuse.
- T'en sais rien.
- Le nouveau,
l'hťro est tombťe du ciel
direct dans son sang ?
J'ai perdu la garde de mon fils !
Pourquoi je risquerais
le truc le plus prťcieux ?
- Parce que t'es une junk.
- Plus maintenant.
Je veux pas qu'il me voie
comme Áa.
Ayez une attitude de gratitude.
Vous Ítes vernie.
Votre fils pourra vous revoir,
clean
et en vie.
Mais Huey a raison : acceptez
que vous avez un problŤme.
Je sais que j'ai un problŤme.
J'ai perdu mon fils.
Section A, page 22 :
5 avis de dťcŤs.
J'ai consultť les noms
et l'un d'eux, David Arnold,
- a travaillť ici.
- Quand ?
ll n'y a rien d'autre sur lui.
C'est bizarre.
lci, ils vťrifient tout.
Ce qui fait de votre prťsence
un mystŤre.
C'est ridicule !
Et s'il arrive quelque chose
ŗ Jarod pendant
qu'on chasse des fantŰmes ?
Continuez ŗ suivre la piste
David Arnold.
Pas de problŤme.
N'en informez que moi.
C'est un joli garÁon
que tu as lŗ.
Je n'ai jamais connu ma mŤre,
mais j'ai idťalisť
notre relation.
Ecoute, Jarod,
c'est sympa de m'avoir dťfendue,
mais laisse-moi.
Je ne peux pas.
Tu vois... Si je suis ici,
c'est pour t'aider.
En hommage ŗ ton pŤre.
ll est mort
depuis plus de 20 ans.
Je sais, Jill.
Ton fils t'attend.
- ll ne doit pas me voir comme Áa.
- Tu es sa mŤre.
Rien ne changera
ce qu'il ťprouve pour toi.
<i>Hilar</i>y <i>et moi,</i>
<i>on a des courses ŗ faire.</i>
<i>Ton smo</i>k<i>ing pour le mariage,</i>
<i>les billets...</i>
Dis bonjour ŗ maman
et on s'en va. D'accord ?
Le magasin de smokings
est ouvert tard
et l'agence nous enverra
les billets.
S'il te plaÓt, papa.
Passe le temps que tu veux
avec maman.
Qui c'est ?
Tu m'as manquť.
Toi aussi.
Pourquoi tu trembles ?
Maman est malade.
Tu vas guťrir ?
Et devine.
Si le Dr Earl est d'accord,
je rentrerai bientŰt.
Je pourrai vivre avec toi ?
Non, mon chťri.
Tu ne m'aimes plus ?
Bien sŻr que si.
Je t'aime de tout mon coeur.
Le cercle de confiance.
Vous venez de le rompre.
Enferme-le.
- Tu veux quoi ?
- Te parler.
C'est le seul endroit
oý on est pas entendus.
Laisse-moi.
ll n'aurait pas voulu Áa.
D'oý tu sors Áa ?
Ton pŤre me l'a donnťe.
On m'a enlevť
ŗ ma famille.
En me donnant cette photo,
ton pŤre m'a donnť une famille.
Je sais que c'est dingue,
mais c'est vrai.
Ta place n'est pas ici.
Tu n'aurais pas risquť
la garde de ton fils.
Je me souviens
de cette photo.
Je venais d'entrer au lycťe.
C'est l'annťe oý tout a basculť.
J'ai rencontrť un type super.
Un dealer.
En moins de deux, j'ťtais accro.
Et ton pŤre t'a fait dťcrocher.
Pas de leÁon de morale,
juste un amour inconditionnel.
Puis il est mort.
Tout ce temps, j'ťtais clean.
Je suis restťe clean longtemps.
Et j'ai connu Todd.
On s'est mariťs, on a eu Chris.
La vie ťtait belle.
Et tu as replongť.
J'ai tout fait foirer.
Le temps que je le comprenne,
Todd ťtait parti avec Chris.
Puis il a rencontrť Hilary.
Je savais
que je ne devais plus y toucher.
Alors j'ai dťcrochť,
j'ai passť un diplŰme de prof.
Tout allait bien.
La Cour allait me donner la garde.
La veille du jugement...
J'ai aucun souvenir
d'en avoir pris.
J'ai perdu toute chance
de rťcupťrer mon fils.
ll y a toujours une chance.
Pas pour moi.
Quand Hilary ťpousera Todd,
elle l'adoptera.
Parle-moi du jour
avant le jugement.
Le matin, j'ťtais clean.
Je suis venue ici pour l'analyse.
3 jours aprŤs, j'ťtais dans le parc.
J'aurais pas tout foutu en l'air.
Pas ma vie. Pas ma famille.
Comment Áa va, aujourd'hui ?
On m'a dit
que vous dormez mal.
Vous voulez un patch de clonidine ?
Áa vous dťtendra.
Si tout va bien,
vous pourrez sortir vendredi.
Vraiment ?
On veut s'assurer
que vous Ítes prÍte
- et qu'il n'y aura pas de rechute.
- Je suis prÍte.
Dormez.
Je viendrai vous voir demain.
L'office de cartographie
du Delaware m'envoie
la carte 1 0-1 7-76.
A-22, Áa doit Ítre
les coordonnťes de Jarod.
Bravo.
Prťvenez-nous quand vous l'aurez.
Broots, je veux vous parler
du rapport G-4.
A plus tard, Sydney.
Alors ?
Vous connaissez Winkey,
l'infirmier plein de tics ?
Je n'ai pas ce plaisir.
ll se souvient que David Arnold
ťtait infirmier ici
il y a une vingtaine d'annťes.
J'ai consultť la liste de DSA
de l'infirmerie
et j'ai trouvť deux entrťes.
Mais les DSA ont disparu.
Quelqu'un a cherchť
ŗ effacer ce type.
Vous avez consultť
sans autorisation
les fichiers de l'infirmerie.
Si David Arnold
vous intťresse,
c'ťtait l'un des hommes
les plus gentils
que j'ai connus.
Que devient-il ?
ll nourrit les vers.
Arnold est plus mort
que vos cheveux.
Alors, dites-moi, Mlle Parker,
comment David Arnold
vous rapproche-t-il de Jarod ?
Nous explorons chaque piste,
y compris celles qui sont mortes.
ll ne ferait pas ce cirque
s'il ne cachait pas quelque chose.
La rťponse est dans ces DSA,
qui se trouvent sŻrement
dans la collection privťe de Raines.
Belle bťcane. Qu'est-ce
qu'on attend pour se tirer ?
lls me laisseraient pas
la conduire.
Tu t'y connais en mťcanique ?
J'ai lu un bouquin dessus.
Mais pas sur les motos.
Le moteur se noie ?
Le c‚ble n'est pas reliť
ŗ l'aiguille.
Áa alors ! Merci.
Sympa, ton T-shirt.
''Skinned Rabbit'' ?
Un groupe de rock.
On a fait un tube dans les 80's.
Bloody Love Bones.
J'ťtais larguť.
Dans les 70's aussi.
Et la plus grande partie
des 90's.
Moi, j'ťtais leur roadie.
On a tournť avec les grands.
Les Stones, Allman Brothers.
On a sorti 2 pauvres albums
qui ont chauffť
des gymnases pour Air Supply.
Des problŤmes d'aťration ?
Exactement.
Ecoute, mec.
ll faut que je tape.
De quoi tu causes ?
Tu te grattes,
tes pupilles rťtractťes...
Je crois que tu sais
de quoi je cause.
Dťpanne-moi.
Demande ŗ Garrett.
Si on l'a pas encore coincť.
- Encore ?
- Earl l'a pris
en train de dealer
ŗ une patiente.
Un infirmier d'un centre
de dťsintox peut faire Áa ?
ll se passe
de drŰles de trucs, ici.
Elle fait une OD !
Je m'en occupe.
Sa respiration !
ll faut l'intuber, vite !
Entre !
Comment avez-vous pu faire Áa ?
Raines a failli me coincer.
Je suis restť sous son canapť
plus d'une heure.
Sa masseuse est venue
lui passer de l'huile en chantant :
<i>A la riviŤre.</i>
Les DSA ?
Vous n'allez pas le croire.
Je ne sais pas
ce qui s'est passť.
L'important,
c'est que tu t'en tires.
Viens t'allonger.
C'est peut-Ítre moi.
Je me rappelle plus
ce qui m'arrive.
J'ai pas la force
de recommencer.
Trouve la force, pour ton fils.
- Je l'ai perdu.
- C'est pas vrai.
Pourquoi tu fais Áa ?
Je le dois ŗ ton pŤre.
<i>Aidez-moi !</i>
ll a eu une sale grippe.
Ce n'est pas la grippe.
Regardez.
Ce salaud de cul-bťni
a fait de Jarod un toxico.
Tiens.
Tu dois boire pour t'hydrater.
Encore.
Pourquoi ce ''Centre''
droguait un enfant ?
Pour eux,
je n'ťtais pas un enfant.
<i>Vous m'avez appelť ?</i>
<i>Netto</i>y<i>ez la piŤce.</i>
<i>Ce garÁon est malade.</i>
<i>Bien, docteur.</i>
<i>Petit, je suis infirmier.</i>
<i>Aidez-moi, je vous en prie !</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu as ?</i>
<i>Qui t'a fait Áa ?</i>
<i>Aidez-moi !</i>
<i>Tiens bon.</i>
<i>Je vais t'aider.</i>
<i>Áa va aller.</i>
C'est David Arnold.
Le lien avec Jarod.
Arnold l'a aidť ŗ dťcrocher.
- J'ai chaud, je brŻle.
- Tiens bon.
- Áa va passer.
- J'ai mal partout.
<i>Tiens bon. Áa va passer.</i>
- J'y arriverai pas.
- Mais si.
Concentre-toi sur moi.
<i>Donnez-m'en un peu</i>
<i>pour la douleur.</i>
<i>Je ne peuX pas faire Áa.</i>
<i>J'</i>y <i>arriverai pas !</i>
Donne-moi quelque chose,
je t'en prie !
Et lui ?
ll suffit ?
<i>J'ai besoin de ma famille</i>
<i>pour m'aider.</i>
<i>Oý est-elle ?</i>
<i>Je ne sais pas.</i>
<i>J'ai oubliť.</i>
<i>Accroche-toi ŗ Áa.</i>
<i>Ma fille Jill et moi</i>
<i>serons ta famille.</i>
<i>Comment je vous revaudrai Áa ?</i>
<i>T'inquiŤte.</i>
<i>Un jour, tu le feras.</i>
Mlle Parker, vous devez voir
le DSA suivant.
<i>- M. Arnold ?</i>
<i>- Oui, docteur.</i>
<i>Vous mťritez des ťloges.</i>
<i>Merci.</i>
S<i>ans vouloir outrepasser</i>
<i>ma position,</i>
<i>pourquoi avez-vous droguť</i>
<i>ce garÁon ?</i>
<i>Ce n'est pas votre affaire.</i>
<i>J'en fais mon affaire.</i>
<i>Vos efforts seront</i>
<i>largement rťcompensťs.</i>
<i>Gardez votre argent.</i>
<i>Je n'ai plus rien ŗ faire ici.</i>
<i>On a un problŤme.</i>
C'est datť du 1 7 octobre,
la veille du jour
oý David Arnold
s'est noyť accidentellement
dans sa piscine.
Raines l'a fait tuer
pour qu'il se taise.
Et oý ťtait Sydney,
tout ce temps ?
ll protťgeait Jarod.
Comment a-t-il laissť faire Áa ?
Bonne question.
Je mťrite de le perdre.
Hilary fera
une bien meilleure mŤre.
Je ne sais pas
comment c'est arrivť.
ll est temps de le dťcouvrir.
Garrett, un patient se balade.
Pourquoi t'es sorti
de ta chambre ?
T'avais peur
que je trouve ta dope ?
Enfoirť !
Tu as droguť une femme
qui essayait de refaire sa vie ?
De quoi tu parles ?
Je parle de Jill Arnold !
Tu as mťlangť sa clonidine
avec de l'hťroÔne pure !
Tu prťfŤres avoir affaire ŗ moi
ou aux flics ?
Tu deales ici.
Pourquoi t'as fait Áa ?
J'ai pas accŤs
aux patches de clonidine !
Seul le Dr Earl a pu faire Áa !
Avec ton hťroÔne.
D'accord !
Quand Earl m'a pris ŗ dealer,
il m'a obligť ŗ le fournir.
J'imaginais pas
que c'ťtait pour une patiente.
Pourquoi Earl drogue Jill Arnold ?
J'en sais rien, je te jure !
Je peux t'ouvrir son bureau.
Hilary ?
J'appelle de la part du Dr Earl.
ll y a un problŤme
avec Jill Arnold.
ll a besoin de vous
tout de suite.
Hilary ?
Le Dr Earl est en retard.
Un verre d'eau, en attendant ?
<i>Aidez-moi !</i>
Comment avez-vous pu
laisser faire Áa ?
C'ťtait un enfant.
A l'ťpoque, le Centre travaillait
avec des gens
qui perfectionnaient
un narcotique capable d'accroÓtre
les performances mentales.
Vous les avez laissťs
le tester sur Jarod ?
Raines l'a dťcidť.
L'idťe qu'un grand esprit
comme Jarod puisse
devenir encore plus grand
ťtait trop sťduisante.
La drogue, malheureusement...
avait de graves effets secondaires.
Accoutumance rapide
et sevrage cauchemardesque.
Raines transforme Jarod
en cobaye
et vous fermez les yeux ?
Pourquoi, Sydney ?
ll a fait de Sydney
un toxico.
Oý suis-je ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
Jill Arnold a dŻ se poser
les mÍmes questions.
Faisons une petite thťrapie
de groupe.
Sauf que cette fois,
c'est vous,
les patients.
- De quoi vous parlez ?
- Du cercle de confiance...
Vous avez droguť Jill
contre son grť.
Je fais pareil avec vous.
Mais avec un mťlange
qui fait croire
qu'on est toxico depuis des annťes.
Le sevrage que je vous inflige
s'appelle le ''poulet froid''.
- Cocorico !
- Vous Ítes malade.
Enfoirť !
Ce n'est pas lŗ
une attitude de gratitude.
Rassurez-vous,
j'ai apportť
des patches de clonidine
contre la douleur.
- Donnez-moi un patch.
- Parlons d'abord
de vos motivations pour savoir
- qui mťrite le patch.
- Donnez-le-moi !
Qui Ítes-vous ?
Quelqu'un qui peut
mettre fin ŗ vos tourments.
Dites-moi la vťritť.
Je ne tiendrai pas.
Parlez-moi.
Je ne peux pas.
Donnez-moi un patch.
Rťjouissez-vous des 8 h ŗ venir,
la tÍte dans la cuvette.
Donnez-moi un patch.
Et un patch de moins.
C'est lui.
- ll avait besoin de fric.
- Ta gueule !
Áa devait pas se savoir.
C'est toi qui voulais le mŰme !
Donnez-moi un patch.
ArrÍtez-moi si je me trompe.
Todd Moffett est un homme
trŤs riche.
Tellement riche
que si vous divorcez,
vous aurez une sacrťe rente,
surtout en adoptant son fils.
Et quel meilleur moyen
d'obtenir sa garde
qu'en transformant sa mŤre
en junkie ?
Et quel meilleur complice
que votre chťri de la fac ?
Comment savez-vous Áa ?
Disons que j'ai jetť un oeil
sur l'album de la fac.
Quel joli couple !
Dommage que des tourtereaux
comme vous
aient ŗ subir
de telles souffrances.
J'ai dťjŗ testť
ce petit mťlange
et croyez-moi...
C'est une saloperie.
Plus qu'un patch de clonidine.
Ce serait bÍte
de vous battre
dans un sevrage pareil.
J'avoue !
J'ai droguť Jill Arnold
pour qu'elle perde son fils.
Je peux avoir le patch ?
ll est coupable.
Donnez-le-moi.
Comme vous disiez, docteur,
la guťrison commence en admettant
qu'on a un problŤme.
Pas vrai ?
C'est vrai.
Croyez-moi, vous deux
avez un sacrť problŤme !
On va bientŰt voir maman.
Jill disait la vťritť,
finalement ?
J'ai honte
de lui Ítre rentrť dedans.
On en apprend chaque jour.
J'ai dťcidť
de finir ma cure
comme il faut.
Je planais complŤtement.
Je dois penser ŗ mon avenir.
Bravo.
Merci. Un cadeau.
- C'est quoi ?
- Skinned Rabbit.
<i>Blood</i>y <i>Love Bones.</i>
L'ťcoute pas ŗ l'envers.
Merci pour tout.
J'espŤre que Jill me pardonnera.
A vous de jouer.
On rentre ŗ la maison ?
Dans deux secondes.
- Tu as l'air mieux.
- Je me sens mieux.
- Et maintenant ?
- Un jour ŗ la fois.
Comment je te revaudrai Áa ?
La dette est dťjŗ payťe.
- Sydney.
<i>- Vous travaillez encore ?</i>
<i>Merci d'appeler.</i>
J'ťtais inquiet.
Vous pensiez
que j'avais replongť ?
Pourquoi vous les avez laissťs
me faire Áa ?
J'avais confiance en vous.
<i>Vous ťtiez comme un...</i>
Vous auriez dŻ les empÍcher.
Je ne pouvais pas.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que je testais
le produit moi-mÍme.
Comment Áa ?
J'ai demandť ŗ Raines,
j'ai exigť
qu'on ne teste pas la drogue
sur toi, mais sur moi.
<i>Raines a acceptť.</i>
<i>Ce n'est qu'en sortant de cure</i>
<i>que j'ai su ce qui ťtait arrivť.</i>
Qu'il avait menti.
Vous vous Ítes sacrifiť
pour me protťger.
Pourquoi ne pas
me l'avoir dit ?
Je ne voulais pas
que tu te sentes obligť
de rester au Centre
si tu pouvais t'ťchapper.
<i>Je suis dťsolť.</i>
SincŤrement dťsolť.

- Quoi ?
<i>- Toujours accro au boulot ?</i>
Pour me harceler,
rappelle aux heures de bureau.
Qui dit que je veux te harceler ?
Je me sens peut-Ítre
<i>nostalgique.</i>
Si tu as le mal du pays,
viens nous voir.
J'ai une chambre qui t'attend.
C'est une offre gťnťreuse,
que je dťcline ŗ regret.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux, Jarod ?
Passer le bonjour au reste
de notre famille recomposťe.
- Surtout ŗ M. Raines.
<i>- Je ne manquerai pas</i>
de lui dire ''salut''
quand je le verrai.
Tu l'as vu, rťcemment ?
<i>ll n'est pas souvent lŗ, on dirait.</i>
Quand Raines est absent,
je suis ravie, je ne demande rien.
<i>Qui ne demande rien</i>
n'apprend rien.
J'ai les relevťs de tťlťphone
du Triumvirat.
Áa attendra, Broots.
J'ai une autre croisade
pour vous :
les dťplacements de Raines.
C'est pas trop tŰt.
Dites-moi que vous l'avez trouvť.
Je te paie
parce que t'es dans la place.
Ce gamin devrait dťjŗ Ítre mort.
Bolton, Minnesota, Áa a l'air
d'Ítre un trou.
ll est facile ŗ trouver.
ll va ŗ l'ťcole, non ?
Le temps presse. Mon procŤs
est rťvisť dans 5 jours
et ŗ part le tťmoignage du mŰme,
ils ont rien
contre moi.
Alors, trouve-le
et tue-le.
Sinon, t'es mort.
Pigť ? Me fais pas faux bond.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
T'es pressť ?
ll se trouve que oui.
Bonjour, les enfants.
Je m'appelle M. Brody.
Je remplace votre professeur.
<i>On m'a enlevť ŗ ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble dťjŗ</i>

M. Conklin,
votre professeur,
est en vacances.
Avant de commencer,
j'aimerais vous connaÓtre
un peu mieux.
Vous Ítes calť en sexe ?
M. Conklin devait commencer
l'ťducation sexuelle.
- Ma mŤre a signť un mot.
- Kevin...
lntťressť par la biologie.
TrŤs bien !
Je sais tout sur le sexe.
- Mon pŤre a lnternet.
- Joel...
Aime l'informatique.
Vous Ítes mariť ?
Gemma.
Vous avez une fiancťe ?
Elle s'y connaÓt en sexe ?
C'est ŗ moi de poser les questions,
n'oubliez pas.
Et toi... Matthew ?
Qu'est-ce qui t'intťresse ?
J'aime bien lire.
Tu aimes lire...
C'est bien.
Et toi...
Qu'est-ce qui t'intťresse ?
Des trucs classes :
espionnage, contre-espionnage.
Si je vous en dis plus,
je devrai vous tuer.
Eric est barge !
ll sait pas ťcrire.
C'est du charabia.
C'est un code
pour que les crťtins
- comme toi puissent pas lire.
- PlutŰt une lettre d'amour
ŗ ta Molly chťrie.
Revenons ŗ nos moutons.
Áa suffit !
Soyez sympas.
C'est dur d'Ítre le nouveau.
Certains savent ce que c'est.
Combien d'entre vous
sont nťs ici ?
Combien ont toujours
vťcu ŗ Bolton ?
Je suis nťe ici,
mais pas mon frŤre.
Et combien
ont des frŤres et soeurs ?
Et le sexe ?
<i>C'est le tťmoignage</i>

Quelle est la rŤgle
pour les affaires d'autrui ?
Ce ne sont pas vos dossiers.
Non, mais il n'y avait personne
dans le bureau...
La rŤgle,
pour les affaires d'autrui,
c'est qu'on n'y touche pas.
Je comprends, mais...
Chaque chose ŗ sa place.
Mme Warner,
Jarod est notre remplaÁant.
Je compte sur vous
pour me les rendre.
Mme Warner est ici ŗ perpŤte.
32 ans d'anciennetť.
Tout le monde a 1 0 ans,
- pour elle.
- Áa fait peur.
On a l'impression
de revenir au lycťe.
Ou de le dťcouvrir.
Rachel Daly est notre C.E.
Jarod remplace M. Conklin
qui est ŗ Hawaii.
Quel veinard, ce Conklin.
ll rÍvait de Hawaii
- et il gagne un concours.
- Sans mÍme avoir jouť.
- lncroyable.
- Si vous permettez,
je dois voir un ťlŤve
qui aime les sirŤnes d'incendie.
Ravie de vous connaÓtre.
Monsieur le directeur,
j'ai un ťlŤve dans ma classe,
Matthew Reese,
dont le dossier
ne remonte qu'ŗ 1 1 mois.
Avant, rien.
Matthew est arrivť l'an dernier.
- Les dossiers sont transfťrťs.
- En principe.
Mais son ťcole a brŻlť.
Tous les dossiers ont ťtť dťtruits.
Ceci explique cela.
Raines frťquente
un asile de fous ?
Le Pratt lnstitute,
ŗ environ 1 h au sud d'ici.
ll s'y rend plusieurs fois
par jour.
Regardez, le voilŗ.
Au milieu des zozos.
ll vient en visiteur.
ll y a une femme.
Une femme qui compte pour Jarod.
Mais qui est-elle ?
C'est Edna Raines.
Sa femme ?
C'est impossible.
Briefez-moi, Sydney.
Edna Raines s'est suicidťe
il y a plus de 20 ans.
C'est ce qu'on vous a dit.
- Broots, trouvez une voiture.
- Trop tard.
Elle s'est ťchappťe cette nuit.
On est peut-Ítre mal payťs,
mais manger au self...
- Vous Ítes suicidaire ?
- Juste curieux.
Un tube de viande hachťe
enrobť de fťculents frits
et un b‚ton pour porter le tout...
Une espŤce de sucette ŗ la viande.
Votre 1 er corndog ?
Vous Ítes plus courageux que moi.
Matthew ne se mÍle pas beaucoup
aux autres enfants.
ll a des problŤmes particuliers ?
ll a un peu de mal ŗ s'intťgrer
depuis son transfert,
mais Áa arrive souvent.
Pourquoi cet intťrÍt ?
Plus j'en sais sur mes ťlŤves,
plus je pourrai les aider.
<i>Áa fait trois jours.</i>
Me dis pas que tu avances,
dis-moi que le mŰme est mort.
Si t'es pas fichu de le trouver,
je m'en occuperai moi-mÍme !
T'as intťrÍt ŗ prier
que je t'enterre pas avec lui.
Mon fils m'a parlť
d'un nouveau prof.
Je vous apporte Áa
en signe de bienvenue.
C'est trŤs gentil, merci.
C'est chaud.
Laissez-moi faire.
Je sais ce que c'est,
d'Ítre nouveau en ville.
Matthew et moi,
on n'est lŗ que depuis un an.
Matthew... Matthew Reese ?
Je suis sa mŤre.
Je ne vous l'ai pas dit ?
Vous veniez d'oý ?
De l'est.
Justine !
Bonjour, Gail.
Vous vous connaissez ?
On est au club cuisine
des mŤres cťlibataires.
C'est classe, non ?
ll y a tout un monde
invisible ŗ l'oeil nu.
Comme le cerveau microscopique
d'Eric.
- Comment ils font pour nager ?
- TrŤs bonne question.
Lisez le chapitre 4
pour le savoir.
- J'ai perdu le bouquin.
- Au travail.
C'est chouette, non ?
Ouais, mais j'ai dťjŗ vu
des trucs protozoaires.
On avait des microscopes
ŗ mon ancienne ťcole.
Tu aimais ton ancienne ťcole ?
- Pas mal.
- Áa a dŻ Ítre dur
de quitter tes amis comme Áa.
D'aprŤs ma mŤre,
on avait pas le choix.
Et je suis pas censť en parler.
C'est perso !
Dťsolť, mec.
C'est mignon.
Áa te dťpasse.
Tu crois ? On va voir.
Je m'appelle Eric Gantry.
Je suis une mauviette
et j'aime Molly ŗ la folie.
La rŤgle
pour les affaires d'autrui ?
On n'y touche pas.
Super viril,
te faire dťfendre par le prof !
On dirait qu'il t'a dans le nez.
C'est rien.
Un espion
a toujours des ennemis.
Laissez tomber.
Je n'en reviens pas
qu'Edna soit en vie.
<i>Vous l'aimiez ?</i>
Beaucoup.
Edna n'ťtait pas comme
tant d'ťpouses du Centre.
<i>Elle ťtait plus vivante.</i>
Sa tÍte me dit quelque chose.
Elle ťtait mťdecin au Centre.
<i>- A l'infirmerie.</i>
- C'est vrai.
Elle m'a soignťe
pour les oreillons.
<i>Votre mŤre lui faisait confiance.</i>
Edna avait beaucoup de qualitťs.
<i>Elle s'investissait</i>
<i>dans la politique locale</i>
autant que dans les cocktails
du Centre.
Comment elle s'est retrouvťe
mariťe ŗ Raines ?
<i>AprŤs le meurtre de leur fille,</i>
<i>elle s'est effondrťe.</i>
On a parlť d'une surdose
de barbituriques.
J'ťtais ŗ l'enterrement.
lls ont enterrť quoi
au cimetiŤre du Centre ?
<i>Broots est sur la piste d'Edna.</i>
Raines aussi, sans doute.
Je crois que Áa mine
sa nouvelle sťrťnitť.
Motus et bouche cousue.
Bonsoir.
Broots, donnez-moi
une bonne nouvelle.
C'est si bon de te revoir,
Catherine !
Dans un patelin si tranquille,
des pervers font la sortie
des ťcoles ?
- Vous l'avez bien vu ?
- Non.
ll a filť sans demander son reste.
Au fait, les enfants
organisent un bal, vendredi.
Une journťe Sadie Hawkins.
J'aimerais
que vous veniez aussi.
Avec joie. J'ai h‚te
de rencontrer Mlle Hawkins.
Attends.
Tu as oubliť ton dťjeuner.
Je travaille tard.
On dÓnera avec des restes.
Mme Gantry...
Jarod Brody,
le nouveau professeur d'Eric.
J'aimerais vous parler
de ses problŤmes.
Avec Joel ? Eric m'a racontť
ce qui s'est passť hier.
Joel pose un peu problŤme.
Mais ŗ part Áa, Áa va ?
A part Áa ?
Je m'inquiŤte un peu.
Avec sa manie de jouer
ŗ l'agent secret.
Faire semblant
n'est pas si grave.
Si ce n'est pas
une faÁon de fuir.
ll est jeune
et je me fais du souci bÍtement.
Ce n'est pas bÍte
de penser ŗ son fils.
Je lui parlerai.
Mme Warner...
Mon autocollant de parking...
j'ai dŻ le perdre.
Les garÁons perdraient leur tÍte
si elle n'ťtait pas attachťe.
L'absence d'attache cr‚nienne
annulerait les facultťs motrices,
alors l'idťe...
Si Áa peut vous aider,
c'ťtait l'autocollant nl48.
Non, M. Brody.
Vous aviez le 55.
Le 48 appartient ŗ Larry Grasso,
notre gardien.
Matthew a oubliť son dťjeuner.
Je me demandais
- si vous aviez aimť mon risotto.
- En fait,
j'allais vous appeler.
- Vraiment ?
- L'autre soir,
je vous ai posť des questions
sur votre ancienne adresse.
Je sais pourquoi vous les ťvitiez.
J'ai donnť cette impression ?
Gail, je sais pourquoi
vous avez dŻ venir ici.
Vous pouvez me faire confiance.
Vraiment.
C'est si dur de garder le secret
et de vivre
dans le mensonge.
ll semblait
gentil. Je n'imaginais pas
qu'il avait une camťra cachťe.
Tout le monde a lnternet.
Et le temps que je...
Vous n'habitiez pas Woodbury ?
ll n'y a pas eu de tťmoignage
ni de procŤs ?
- Comment va Edna ?
- Aussi morne
que le Bate's Motel.
Edna, vous vous souvenez de moi ?
Nous ťtions collŤgues au Centre
il y a des annťes.
C'est Áa.
Vous vous souvenez.
Edna, vous m'entendez ?
Laissez tomber.
Elle a clignotť tout l'aprŤs-midi.
20 ans de sťdatifs,
Áa laisse des sťquelles.
Quelque chose l'a amenťe ici,
l'a amenťe ŗ chercher ma mŤre.
Quoi ?
Cherchons.
ll n'y a qu'une raison
pour que le Centre
soit allť si loin
pour la faire taire.
Elle connaÓt leurs sales secrets.
Je veux les connaÓtre aussi.
MÍme si Edna ťtait lucide,
elle risque d'Ítre incapable
de vous les dire.
On n'a pas fini de creuser.
Entre fous, on se comprend.
Passons le bťbť ŗ Angelo
et voyons ce qu'il trouve.
Sale journťe, hein ?
- J'en ai peur.
- Une mauvaise nouvelle ?
C'est trŤs sophistiquť,
ton ťquipement d'espion.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Pas mal !
Un pager.
Pour Ítre joignable.
Quand tu es en mission.
Joel a fait l'imbťcile, hier,
en se moquant de toi
devant tout le monde.
Je ne me laisse pas abattre.
Je me fiche
de ce qu'ils pensent,
lui et les autres.
A part Molly ?
Je t'ai vu la regarder.
C'est censť Ítre top secret.
Cet idiot de Joel a tout sabotť.
Regardez Áa.
Tous mes secrets sont lŗ.
On peut pas dire
que la voie soit libre,
mais je ferai une exception.
Une photo incognito.
Pas mal.
Elle doit me dťtester.
Non. Tu es un super espion.
Les filles adorent Áa.
- Mais je fais quoi ?
- A ta place,
je lui dirais carrťment
mes sentiments.
Pas question.
Mission suicidaire.
Si tu aimes quelqu'un,
tu dois le lui dire
quand tu en as l'occasion.
Je saurais pas quoi dire.
EntraÓne-toi avec Áa.
Quand tu seras prÍt, dis-lui.
Vous Ítes mon 1 er ami, ici.
<i>Vous Ítes mon 1 er ami, ici.</i>
<i>Combien ont toujours</i>
<i>vťcu ŗ Bolton ?</i>
<i>Tous mes secrets sont lŗ.</i>
Woodbury.
Eric est le tťmoin.
Vous avez vu Eric Gantry ?
ll a parlť au gardien
et il est parti chez lui.
- Merde...
- M. Brody !
Agent X-4 au rapport.
Oý est Eric ?
J'ai voulu aider ce gosse.
Vous Ítes policier.
ll y a une fuite
dans la protection du tťmoin.
J'allais rťcupťrer Eric.
- lls vont le tuer.
- Qui ?
Qui vous a blessť ?
Je l'ai pas vu.
SŻrement le contact d'Esposito.
- Tenez bon, j'appelle les secours.
- Sauvez Eric.
Le tueur a son adresse.
Le laissez pas rentrer chez lui.
Le laissez pas rentrer.
<i>Un pager.</i>
<i>Pour Ítre joignable.</i>
<i>Danger - Ne rentre pas chez toi</i>
C'est moi.
Allons chercher ta mŤre.
Quand j'ai appris que ce monstre
ťtait sorti, j'ai eu si peur.
Puis, on nous a dit
de ne pas nous inquiťter,
que quelqu'un allait venir
nous protťger.
Le gardien.
L'homme d'Esposito l'a abattu.
Mon Dieu !
On a un numťro d'urgence.
ll y a une fuite ŗ l'agence.
C'est trop risquť.
On fait quoi,
on appelle la police ?
Mon instinct me dit
de ne pas bouger, au moins ce soir.
T‚chez de vous dťtendre.
Je suis dťsolť
d'avoir menti en disant
que j'ťtais nť ici.
On m'a dit de mentir, parfois.
Je ne voulais pas, mais...
Tu as bien fait.
J'ai fini.
ll y a de la glace
au congťlateur.
AprŤs tes devoirs.
ll est gťnial.
Vous en avez bavť.
Mais ce n'est qu'un enfant.
ll mťrite d'Ítre entourť
de sa famille et de ses amis.
Au lieu de Áa,
on l'a enlevť en pleine nuit
en l'obligeant ŗ tout quitter.
Ce n'est pas juste.
Je sais.
Au moins, il a sa mŤre avec lui.
Mon petit bonhomme.
Je ne le mťrite pas.
ll a vu le meurtre.
Sa classe ťtait en sortie.
Eric s'est rťveillť en pleurs
et brŻlant de fiŤvre.
J'aurais dŻ le garder
ŗ la maison,
mais j'ťtais sortie.
Ce qui est arrivť
n'est pas votre faute.
Je suis sa mŤre.
Je lui dois sťcuritť et bonheur.
ll n'a ni l'un ni l'autre.
Le pire, c'est que,
avec le procŤs,
Áa va recommencer.
Doucement, Angelo.
Je t'emmŤne voir
une amie ŗ moi. Edna.
Amie de Sydney morte.
Non, elle est bien vivante.
Non. Morte ŗ l'intťrieur.
C'est pour Áa que j'ai besoin
de toi. Tu comprends ?
On travaille tard ?
Le zozo devrait pas dormir ?
Je me suis dit
qu'Angelo pourrait deviner
le prochain mouvement de Jarod.
Áa attendra.
Les dons d'Angelo sont appelťs
ŗ une autre t‚che.
ProblŤme ?
Non, bien sŻr.
Par ici, ouistiti.
Qu'est-ce qu'on va devenir ?
Je ne sais pas.
On risque d'avoir
ŗ partir en vitesse.
Maman, je ne peux pas partir.
Pas encore.
Chťri, on n'a pas le choix.
J'ai une chose ŗ faire.
Je suis dťsolťe.
Áa n'aurait jamais dŻ t'arriver.
Essaie de dormir.
Et maintenant ?
D'aprŤs le policier, l'homme
d'Esposito est dans l'ťcole.
Je dois le trouver
avant qu'il nous trouve.
<i>Programme de protection</i>

Mme Raines, le monstre
que vous avez ťpousť

Pourquoi ? Que saviez-vous ?
C'est si bon de te revoir,
Catherine.
C'est Áa, je suis Catherine,
votre amie.
Je veux vous aider.
Aidez-moi, vous aussi.
C'est si bon de te revoir,
Catherine.
Vous Ítes venue me voir
pour une raison prťcise.
Dites-moi laquelle.
C'est si bon de te revoir,
Catherine.
Ecoutez, je ne suis pas Catherine,
d'accord ?
Catherine est morte
depuis longtemps.
Vous m'entendez ?
Je ne suis pas ma mŤre.
Et vos oreillons, Mlle Parker ?
Vous vous souvenez.
Edna, je vous en prie.
Dites-moi pourquoi
vous Ítes venue me voir.
Mirage.
Mirage ?
C'est quoi, Mirage ?
Votre mŤre avait commencť,

Qu'est-ce que c'ťtait ?

Seul Eric peut envoyer
Esposito en prison. Oý est-il ?
ll dort encore.
ll a besoin de sommeil.
Vous devez partir.
Je m'occuperai de Rachel aprŤs.
Mon Dieu, ils l'ont enlevť !
La fenÍtre a ťtť ouverte

Oý a-t-il pu aller ?
Je peux te parler ?
Je dois partir quelque part

mais je voulais
te dire un truc avant.
Toute l'annťe, j'ai...
Dťsolť,

Tiens.
Tu n'as qu'ŗ ťcouter Áa.
D'accord.
Dťsolť de t'interrompre,
mais t'as rencard avec mon poing.
Je te cherchais.
Viens avec moi.
Tu as de la visite.
Salut, tu te souviens de moi ?
Tu as vu Eric Gantry ?
Joel l'a chassť par lŗ.
Mon Dieu, elle le tient !
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
Oý l'ont-ils emmenť ?
Une minute.
Bravo, Eric.
<i>- Laissez-moi.</i>
<i>- La ferme.</i>
Mon Dieu, c'est lui !
<i>- Oý vous m'emmenez ?</i>
<i>- Pas loin.</i>
<i>J'ai oubliť le casque.</i>
- Avance, Eric.
<i>- L‚chez-moi !</i>
Appelez la police.
Je jure que je tťmoignerai pas
si vous me rel‚chez.
Dťsolť. Tant que t'es vivant,
tu me pourris la vie.
Dans le trou.
Sois sage et obťis.
Tous les deux.
Remplis-le toi-mÍme.
Dieu soit louť, Jarod !
Je l'ai vu emmener Eric
- et je n'ai...
- Je sais.
Vous savez quoi ?
Ce trou n'est pas assez plein.
Áa va ?
Va t'occuper de ta mŤre.
Áa tombe bien, non ?
Vous Ítes dans un trou
dont vous pouvez pas sortir.
On voulait juste lui parler.
Comme elle a parlť
ŗ l'agent de police
quand elle l'a tuť ?
Ou comme t'as parlť
au commerÁant
il y a 2 ans
avant de le battre ŗ mort ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
- Jarod ?
- ll est dingue.
Eric n'ťtait qu'un enfant.
ll voulait juste passer son enfance
avec sa famille et ses amis.
Mais vous lui avez enlevť tout Áa.
En un instant,
on lui a tout enlevť.
A vous de disparaÓtre.
Personne vous regrettera.
C'est vrai, j'ai vendu Eric
et j'ai tuť le flic,
mais je peux vous aider
en tťmoignant.
La ferme !
Offre-lui plus de fric, Esposito.
T'es dingue.
Tu peux pas faire Áa.
Qui Ítes-vous ?
Celui qui creuse votre tombe.
Vous l'avez dťjŗ creusťe.
Moi, je la remplis.
DťpÍchez-vous de parler.
Áa sŤche vite.
D'accord, j'avoue !
J'avoue !
Pardon ?
J'ai tuť le commerÁant.
Je l'ai payťe pour tuer le mŰme.
Tu es content ?
En fait, oui.
Mais vous disparaÓtrez quand mÍme.
Tous les deux.
J'ai avouť !
Nous laissez pas ici !
Du nouveau sur Mirage ?
J'ai consultť le fichier des DSA...
Dans les grandes lignes, Broots.
Rien sur Mirage.
C'est peut-Ítre n'importe quoi.
Cette femme est un peu cinglťe.
Oui, mais pas
quand elle a dit ''Mirage''.
Je le sais.
Je me remets au boulot.
ArrÍte, Joel.
Tu m'as apportť quoi, aujourd'hui ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Des brownies.
Fais pas Áa.
Tu le regretteras.
J'ai jamais rien regrettť.
Pas mal.
Dommage que ta mŤre

Patience.
Ce sera rapide
avec tous les pruneaux

environ...
Maintenant.
Je me demande ce qu'il a.
Un truc qu'il a mangť ?
Agent Gantry, mission accomplie.
Mission accomplie.
Vous avez lu le journal,
ce matin ?
Je ne comprends pas
comment ils ont su
sans parler du type
qui a rťussi le coup.
L'enseignement, c'est ingrat.
Pas entiŤrement.
Je peux te parler ?
J'ai ťcoutť ta cassette.
C'ťtait gentil.
Áa m'a fait plaisir.
Vraiment ?
Je me demandais...
Tu veux venir au bal
avec moi, demain ?
Bien sŻr.
Super. On se verra en cours.
On est obligťs
de partir ce soir ?
Mon agent secret
a un dernier rendez-vous ?
Elle va bien, Sam ?
Elle s'est couchťe
et n'a rien dit.
Nous voilŗ bredouilles.
Pas tout ŗ fait.
J'ai Mirage.

La femme de Raines
a fui cet asile seulement
pour vous parler
de votre mčre et de Mirage ?
D'aprčs Edna, Mirage
était l'oeuvre de ma mčre.
Je suis censée la terminer.
Personne ne se rappelle
un projet de ce nom.
Serait-ce une hallucination ?
Vous n'avez pas vu ses yeux.
A ce moment,
elle était aussi saine d'esprit
que vous et moi.
Broots, vous avez téléchargé du X ?
Mon e-mail est HS.
Quelqu'un d'ici
- a entendu parler de Mirage.
- Excusez-moi.
Je viens chercher les sacs
ŕ incinérer.
Je la connaissais.
- Pardon ?
- Catherine.
C'était quelqu'un de bien.
Vous connaissiez ma mčre ?
C'était un esprit vif et brillant,
męme dans les heures
les plus sombres.
Pardon de cette interruption.
Nous pourrions nous revoir,
si ça ne vous dérange pas,
monsieur...
Leonard. Ce serait avec plaisir.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
- Tout doit brűler.
- Mlle Parker veut voir ça.
Tout doit brűler, j'ai dit.
Mlle Parker doit le voir.
Grosse erreur.
Je dois parler ŕ Mlle Parker.
<i>Aprčs le cambriolage,</i>

<i>Nous vous tiendrons informés</i>
<i>au fur et ŕ mesure.</i>
<i>En direct</i>
<i>du quartier des entrepôts...</i>
J'ai la gorge en feu !
J'étouffe !
y a un problčme.
C'est ça.
C'est ce qu'on a volé.
<i>Gaz neuroplégique</i> S<i>oman</i>
Eh, le savant, c'est quoi ?
Du gaz neuroplégique.
ça peut nous tuer ?
- ça nous tue déjŕ.
- Comment ça ?
Sauf miracle, on sera tous morts
dans moins de 6 heures.
<i>On m'a enlevé ŕ ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjŕ</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>ŕ cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>

<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>ll défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous ętes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Bonsoir, Broots.
Le type du niveau souterrain 26
a ouvert le feu.
Leonard, l'employé
qui a connu votre mčre.
On a essayé de négocier avec lui.
ça ne l'intéressait pas.
Vous avez troqué l'olivier
contre l'Uzi.
C'est des maničres chrétiennes ?
ll était armé et violent.
ll a menacé un de mes hommes.
ll y avait d'autres solutions.
L'instabilité chez mes employés
est intolérable.
Je la croyais indispensable.
Je veux la vidéo de surveillance
de ce qui s'est passé. Vite.
Déjŕ, les flics nous recherchent
et en plus,
il nous reste que 6 h ŕ vivre ?
Qui t'es pour prononcer
notre heure de décčs ?
Je n'ai pas ŕ le faire, Job.
Tu le sens déjŕ, non ?
On le sent tous, sur notre peau,
dans nos poumons.
Et ça ne fait qu'empirer.
Elijah n'a pas parlé
de voler du gaz.
ll dit sűrement n'importe quoi.
Nous, on se connaît.
Mais lui, qui c'est ?
Un pharmacien au chômedu.
On devrait appeler Elijah.
Exact. On devait voler
des puces d'ordinateur.
Sans parler des 1 00 000 $ chacun.
Merci beaucoup !
On l'appelle.
Elijah a parlé d'un coffre.
C'est tout ce qu'il a dit.
Et alors ?
ll nous doit du blé.
- J'appelle Elijah !
- Non. Elijah nous appelle.
ça a toujours été comme ça.
Je reste pas ici
ŕ attendre de crever.
On doit pouvoir faire
quelque chose contre ce gaz.
ça touche la chimie du cerveau.
Bientôt, notre paranoďa évoluera
- en psychose.
- Comment ça ?
- On va devenir dingues ?
- Exact.
ça ronge nos tissus.
D'abord, la nausée,
puis les tremblements.
Puis nos organes
vont se liquéfier.
Nos entrailles
ressembleront un peu ŕ...
Un peu ŕ ça.
Alors, notre nez
se mettra ŕ saigner...
Arręte ! Arrętez-le.
C'est le portable d'Elijah.
ll doit nous aider.
Et quoi ?
En attendant son appel,
on surfe sur le web ?
ll paraît que ''gore.com''
a des dessins intéressants.
Espčce de garce sarcastique !
T'as un problčme avec les femmes ?
Un accident de couche-culotte ?
Ta mčre se soűlait au petit-déj ?
- La ferme !
- Ou quoi ?
Tu veux me cogner ?
ça suffit !
Męme malades,
il faut qu'on se serre les coudes.
C'est le portable d'Elijah.
Pourquoi il nous a pas contactés ?
ll s'est servi de nous
comme cobayes.
On va vraiment...
On va mourir ?
Non, petit frčre.
Je te promets que non.
Je m'occuperai de toi.
Je m'occupe toujours de toi.
Je sais pas vous,
mais mon frčre et moi,
on se tire.
Vous comptez aller oů ?
- A l'hôpital.
- Réfléchis,
Caďn, avec ce qui te reste
de cervelle.
Avec tous les condés
qui nous encerclent,
vous ferez pas 50 mčtres
avant d'ętre cueillis.
Abraham a raison.
Restons groupés
en attendant qu'Elijah
nous contacte.
D'accord.
Mais si ça dégénčre,
ma derničre action lucide
sera de te mettre une balle
dans la nuque.
Si ça dégénčre,
je prendrai ça comme une faveur.
ça marche.
<i>Le vol a eu lieu dans le quartier</i>
<i>industriel de Dallas.</i>
<i>Pour des raisons inconnues,</i>
<i>le secteur a été bouclé</i>
<i>et on a donné l'ordre</i>
<i>d'évacuer d'urgence</i>
<i>tout le monde eXcepté</i>
<i>les secours.</i>
lls évacuent.
Les flics savent ce qu'on a volé.
Alors, Elijah aussi.
ll voudra le récupérer.
ll va débarquer
et nous sortir de lŕ.
C'est ça.
ll enverra peut-ętre
des singes volants, crétin.
Laisse-le !
Du calme, Tarzan.
J'aurais dű me barrer
quand j'ai su
que pour toi, la Saint-Valentin
était un jour férié.
<i>C'est pas une grosse fęte...</i>
<i>Mais c'est aussi important</i>
<i>que la fęte des secrétaires.</i>
<i>C'est pas non plus un jour férié.</i>
<i>T'as jamais eu de secrétaire.</i>
S<i>i, une fois.</i>
<i>Aprčs le déjeuner,</i>
<i>on se rhabillait et au boulot.</i>
<i>A propos de secrétaires,</i>
<i>gros malin, tu es quoi ?</i>
<i>Un eXpert en effractions ?</i>
<i>Elijah m'a baptisé Abraham.</i>
<i>Et oui, je suis eXpert</i>
<i>en effractions, entre autres.</i>
<i>T'as piqué la virginité</i>
<i>d'une nana ? ça m'épate.</i>
<i>Normal, c'était ta soeur.</i>
<i>De quoi tu ris, crétin ?</i>
<i>Ta soeur, c'est ta mčre.</i>
<i>Comment vous avez réussi</i>
<i>20 coupsen 3 ans ?</i>
<i>On sait rien les uns des autres.</i>
<i>Rčgle d'or de M. Elijah.</i>
<i>Vous avez un appel vidéophonique.</i>
S<i>alut, les gars.</i>
<i>Vous avez fait connaissance</i>
<i>avec M. Abraham ?</i>
<i>C'est une eXcellente recrue.</i>
<i>ll est eXpert en bien des domaines.</i>
S<i>urtout les sciences.</i>
<i>Et nous, on est des andouilles ?</i>
<i>Content de te revoir, Job.</i>
<i>Job a raison.</i>
<i>On se débrouillait bien seuls.</i>
<i>Vraiment ? Je nomme</i>
<i>Abraham responsable.</i>
<i>Je dois obéir</i>
<i>au savant de service ?</i>
<i>Aprčs tout ce qu'on a fait</i>
<i>pour vous,</i>
<i>j'ai pas ŕ supporter ces conneries.</i>
<i>Les autres</i>
<i>se partageront tes 1 00 000 $.</i>
<i>- 1 00 000 $ chacun ?</i>
<i>- C'est beaucoup.</i>
<i>Mais tâchez de ne pas verser</i>
<i>de sang, cette fois.</i>
Comment ne pas verser de sang ?
Charmant !
Quoi ?
<i>La petite Brittan</i>y <i>Tate</i>
<i>tuée dans un cambriolage</i>
Qui est Brittany Tate ?
Notre dernier coup,
il y a 3 mois.
Une gamine a été tuée.
''Brittany Tate, 9 ans,
a été étouffée ŕ mort
''lors d'un cambriolage
ŕ Westbrook.
''On a retrouvé le coussin
ayant servi ŕ l'étouffer,
''un flacon de parfum
et une boîte ŕ musique.''
C'est ce qu'Elijah
entendait par
''Ne versez pas de sang.''
Lequel de vous l'a tuée ?
Personne ne sait.
Personne ne parle.
Caďn est bien silencieux.
Et alors ?
Tu as tué cette petite fille.
Ta cervelle commence ŕ fondre.
On s'en fout
de qui l'a tuée.
C'est fait.
<i>Vous avez un appel vidéophonique.</i>
- Dure soirée ?
- Dure ?
On a été exposés
au gaz neuroplégique.
<i>Vous avez donc accompli</i>
<i>votre mission. Bravo.</i>
Vous nous avez piégés ?
Vous saviez ce qu'on volait ?
<i>Vous auriez accepté la mission ?</i>
La mission ?
On est en train de crever.
Une des bombes fuyait.
On a tous été exposés.
<i>J'avais envisagé cette possibilité.</i>
<i>Au bureau de triage,</i>
<i>il</i> y <i>a un mini laboratoire</i>
<i>pour Abraham.</i>
<i>J'envoie</i>
<i>deuX hommes récupérer</i>
<i>les bombes.</i>
<i>lls seront lŕ</i>
<i>d'ici quelques heures.</i>
<i>Les plans d'urgence</i>
<i>sont mis en oeuvre.</i>
Rien ŕ foutre de l'urgence !
Et le fric ?
<i>Patience, Job.</i>
<i>Mes hommes arrivent.</i>
Attendez !
Et merde !
ll va nous laisser crever ici.
Dis-lui de la fermer
ou je le fais.
Elijah nous laissera pas tomber.
- C'est quoi ?
- Elijah m'a laissé
de quoi fabriquer un antidote.
Tu peux nous sauver ?
Tu regrettes pas
d'avoir été méchant avec moi ?
Combien de temps ?
Cinq heures, peut-ętre moins.
Qu'est-ce qui nous dit
que tu y arriveras ?
J'étais toubib
dans la Guerre du Golfe.
Je connais les armes chimiques.
ll me faut votre sang.
Rien ŕ foutre.
C'est peut-ętre un taré.
Je vais faire comme Caďn :
tenter le coup ŕ l'hosto.
Tu n'y arriveras pas.
Et si tu y arrives,
ils n'auront pas l'antidote.
T'as réponse ŕ tout.
Je me tire.
y a quelqu'un.
Allez, Samson, on y va.
lls sont partis.
La voie est libre.
Ne perdons pas de temps.
Leonard n'a tué personne.
lls l'ont abattu froidement.
Rembobinez, Broots,
avant les coups de feu.
ll appelle qui ?
L'image est trop petite.
Si je grossis l'image,
en isolant ses mains
et le mouvement.
- C'est possible ?
- J'en ai pour une heure.
L'heure tourne.
ça me rappelle
quand maman chantait ça.
Le signal revient.
<i>AuX derničres nouvelles,</i>
<i>un gardien, pčre de 6 enfants,</i>
<i>a failli mourir étranglé</i>
<i>dans le cambriolage</i>
<i>de Magna Technologies.</i>
S<i>on état est jugé critique.</i>
<i>La police recherche</i>
<i>toujours les suspects.</i>
Qui a fait ça ?
Quel idiot a étranglé le gardien ?
ça change quoi ?
ça risque de changer beaucoup
de choses si on survit.
Mais lequel d'entre vous
a des mains d'assassin ?
Dis-moi,
qu'est-ce qu'Elijah lui trouve ?
C'est comme pour les chevaux.
T'as pas Caďn sans Abel.
- Faut que je me tire.
- Calme-toi.
- Je vais me tirer.
- Calme-toi.
Je pensais bien juger les gens.
Je me trompais.
C'est-ŕ-dire ?
Je vous prenais pour des pros.
Vous avez tué une gamine.
Et maintenant, un gardien.
C'est toi ?
Et toi, Job ?
ll a les tripes.
Pour tuer une gamine,
il faut des tripes !
ça peut ętre
n'importe lequel d'entre nous.
- Parle pour toi.
- C'était pas moi.
Un coupable, tous coupables.
Je vais vous dire...
La mort, qui fauche tout
sur son passage,
elle s'en contrefiche.
Et toi ?
T'as pu buter le gardien
aussi bien que nous.
On se connaît
depuis un moment.
Mais toi ?
On te connaît męme pas.
En effet.
<i>Job s'occupera de décoder</i>
<i>les portes</i>
<i>et de détourner les caméras</i>
<i>de sécurité.</i>
<i>Eve, Caďn et moi</i>

<i>Eve aura son détecteur</i>

<i>- Oui.</i>
<i>Je veuX savoir qui t'es, minus.</i>
<i>Elijah eXige l'anon</i>y<i>mat complet.</i>
<i>Pas de nom, pas de passé, rien.</i>
<i>J'ai déjŕ désobéi.</i>
<i>De quoi tu parles ?</i>
<i>J'ai pris ton verre au café</i>

<i>Un pote ŕ moi</i>

<i>Tu me suis ?</i>
<i>Un criminel qui se respecte</i>

<i>T'as jamais violé la loi ?</i>
<i>J'en ai violé des tas.</i>
<i>Mais je suis trop malin,</i>
<i>trop bon</i>
<i>et trop attaché ŕ ma liberté</i>
<i>pour me faire pincer.</i>
<i>Mais toi, Job, en revanche...</i>
<i>Pourquoi tu ris ?</i>
<i>Disons que j'ai aussi vérifié</i>
<i>tes empreintes.</i>
<i>Tu veuX m'eXpliquer</i>
<i>en quoi consiste un ''acte obscčne''</i>
<i>dans un chenil ?</i>
Eh, Simplet, arręte !
Pourquoi ce type
est tellement plus mal que nous ?
On est tous différents.
Chacun évolue
selon son rythme génétique.
Lui, c'est sűr
qu'il ferme la marche.
Mesdames, Messieurs, Abel
et ses 5 morceaux préférés.
Six, si on compte le légume.
Laisse-le.
Désolé. Maman va ętre fâchée.
Je dois nettoyer.
Arręte.
Arręte, Abel.
- Je nettoie pour maman.
- Maman est morte !
Espčce d'imbécile !
Elle est morte !
ça fait 1 0 ans. Réveille-toi !
Je tue le premier qui dit un mot.
ça avance ?
J'y travaille.
Dépęche-toi.
Assieds-toi.
ça ralentit l'effet des toxines.
Je t'ai pas donné mon sang,
tout ŕ l'heure,
parce que j'avais peur.
Pourquoi ?
Je suis enceinte.
De quatre mois.
lls savent ?
Bien sűr.
lls me feraient une fęte,
tu ne crois pas ?
Qu'est-ce que le gaz
fera ŕ mon bébé ?
Les gaz ne passent pas
dans le placenta.
Ton bébé est mieux loti que toi.
Tu peux prendre mon sang,
si mon bébé risque rien.
Promis.
ça y est ?
Oui, mais ça va pas vous plaire.
ll compose le 2725.
Mon poste.

Je vais mourir
ŕ cause du vélo de Frank Beyer.
Pardon ?
Le 1 er truc que j'ai volé.
ll avait des vitesses,
une selle d'enfer.
Jamais vu un bijou pareil.
ça valait le coup d'ętre poursuivi
par les flics pour grimper avec
sur Lincoln Hill.
Elijah les a recrutés oů ?
Chez les scouts ?
Regardez.
La petite Brittany...
Son corps
a été retrouvé
dans une malle comme ça.
- Pas vrai ?
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Le journal, passe encore,

C'est Elijah.

Et alors ?
L'important est ici et maintenant.
Peu importe le passé.
Exact.

Ses affaires.
- A qui ?
- A Brittany Tate.
La petite qui est morte.
C'est ses affaires.
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
y a rien, lŕ-dedans.
J'ai vu une poupée...
une petite photo
et une boîte ŕ musique.
ça sentait le parfum.
ça y est, il perd la boule.
Je veux pas mourir...
Pas comme ça.
Ma peau est en feu !
Le savant !

Pas un geste !
Elijah sera pas content
si vous tuez ses messagers.
Elijah ?
ll nous envoie.
Des flics ripoux ?
C'est signé Elijah.
Vous avez notre fric ?
Vous rigolez ?
Quoi ?
y a pas plus de 1 0 000 $.
On devait avoir 1 00 000 $.
M. Elijah n'est pas satisfait
de votre travail.
ll vous contactera.
En attendant,
donnez-nous les bombes.
Pas de sitôt.
Par ici, allez !
Oů est le fric promis ?
<i>Ce sera dur de vendre</i>

<i>Quelqu'un doit pa</i>y<i>er.</i>

Vous ętes une ordure.
Je vous trouverai, juré !
<i>Męme si tu me trouvais,</i>

Peut-ętre pas lui, Elijah,
mais vous m'oubliez.
Je renvoie
votre messager survivant
chercher notre fric.
S'il n'est pas lŕ dans 2 h,
la police aura les bombes.
C'est clair ?
<i>Entendu. J'espčre</i>
<i>que vous vivrez assez longtemps.</i>
Au fait, c'est la fin
de vos émissions.
Attendez... Mirage.
L'e-mail venait d'Edna Raines.
lmpossible.
Elle peut ŕ peine parler.
Elle a eu un autre accčs
de lucidité.
Et c'est M. Raines qui l'a volé.
Comment il savait
ce que j'avais reçu ?
lls surveillent votre courrier
depuis mardi dernier.
C'est le jour
oů Edna s'est échappée.
ll a dű prévoir
qu'elle vous contacterait.
Que disait l'e-mail ?
Le message est vide,
mais il y a une vidéo
en pičce jointe.
Passez-la.
Pour ça, il faudrait accéder
ŕ l'ordinateur
oů elle a été transférée.
Le bureau de M. Raines.
Qu'attendons-nous ?
Je pisse le sang
et vous vous en foutez.
Vous auriez pas dű tuer
la petite.
Elijah était furieux.
Et le gardien...
Lequel de vous
a la manie de l'étouffement ?
C'était vous ?
Que s'est-il passé ?
Et puis merde,
vous allez mourir, de toute façon.
Un énorme domaine
ŕ Westbrook
abritait des documents
d'espionnage.
Une fortune !
Elijah nous a payés
pour les récupérer.
Celui qui les trouvait
devait les rapporter au fourgon.
Mais quelqu'un a été gourmand
et a décidé de faire un tour
dans la maison d'amis.
La fille du gardien
n'était pas censée ętre lŕ.
Je crois que Caďn l'a tuée.
La ferme.
Tout ça pour quelques dollars.
La ferme !
Ta gueule !
Mark, c'est toi ?
Je suis vraiment désolé
pour ton vélo.
Cette odeur...
ça sent... ça sent le parfum.
La ferme, le légume !
Je veux plus entendre
cette chanson !
Vas-y, joue-la, Sam.
Une derničre fois...
Essaie un peu.
C'est quoi, cette odeur ?
C'est l'antidote ?
Non, c'est ''Champs de Nuit''.
Le parfum de ma mčre.
Je le sentais
quand elle me bordait le soir.
C'est peut-ętre un mensonge.
Je me souviens ŕ peine
si j'avais une mčre.
Un parfum est constitué
de différentes notes.
Le parfumeur est une sorte
de compositeur.
Moi, je vais au coeur des choses.
Certains ne sentent
que les notes dominantes.
Moi, je plonge
ŕ la recherche de l'âme.
Le parfum...
Notes pétillantes du citrus,
notes sombres et graves
de la balsamine.
<i>D'aprčs le rapport médical</i>
<i>que je viens de recevoir,</i>
<i>le gardien</i>
<i>de Magna Technologies</i>
<i>vient de succomber</i>
<i>ŕ ses blessures.</i>
C'était malin !
ll est mort !
Vous avez entendu ? ll est mort !
C'est pas le seul.
Un cadavre de plus
sur les bras.
Je saigne !
Termine ton truc.
Je vais crever. Termine.
Je suis en train.
Lâche-moi !
C'est elle !
C'est la petite Tate !
Et alors ?
Elle est morte.
- On le sera bientôt.
- Je l'ai pas tuée.
- Je l'ai pas tuée.
- Je t'accuse pas.
C'est męme pas sa photo.
Je l'ai pas tuée !
Maintenant, il n'y a de l'antidote
que pour quatre.
Comment ça ?
L'un de nous va mourir.
Reste ŕ savoir
qui.
- Comment on décide ?
- On élimine celui
- qui a tué Brittany Tate.
- Mais on sait pas qui c'est.
On sait.
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
Par élimination. ça peut pas
ętre moi. J'y étais pas.
Je l'ai pas tuée.
Je jure que je l'ai pas tuée.
Je sais que c'est pas toi.
Et je sais que c'est pas toi.
Et je sais...
que c'est pas toi.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Donne-moi l'antidote.
Tu le mérites pas.
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce que...
tu as tué Brittany Tate.
Abraham, je ne sais pas
ce que tu crois savoir,
- mais tu te trompes.
- Vraiment ?
Pour commencer,
tu n'es pas enceinte.
Tu l'as inventé pour qu'on te croie
incapable de tuer une enfant.
Et j'ai cherché dans ton sang
l'hormone de grossesse.
Fin de la partie.
- Le gaz te rend fou.
- La meilleure preuve
a été Brittany elle-męme.
Seul l'assassin l'avait vue
ce soir-lŕ.
Sa photo n'était pas
dans le journal.
Tu es la seule ŕ avoir vu
que c'était pas sa photo.
Tu te rappelais son visage
le soir oů tu l'as tuée.
Pose ton flingue.
Si elle a tué la petite,
c'est par elle
qu'on aura notre fric.
Si tu me descends,
j'en tue au moins deux.
A commencer par le frérot.
Le nez qui saigne.
Tu sais ce que ça veut dire ?
Dis-moi la vérité
et je partage ma dose avec toi.
Désintégration
de tes organes internes.
Liquéfaction totale de ton cerveau.
C'est pas joli joli.
La petite aurait pas dű ętre lŕ.
Elle était lŕ !
Et tu l'as tuée froidement
pour la faire taire.
J'étouffe.
Dis-moi la vérité
et je te donne ça.
Oui, je l'ai tuée.
Maintenant, donne-moi ça.
Balles ŕ blanc.
Sauf les miennes.
Et les siennes.
C'est pas trop tôt !
J'ai failli éternuer.
C'est quoi, cette histoire ?
Je ne suis pas
celui que vous croyez.
J'appartiens au FBl du Texas.
Je vous ai exposés au gaz
pour démasquer l'assassin.
Toi aussi, tu as respiré le gaz.
Pas de gaz Soman.
C'était un virus intestinal
de 1 2 h,

les sinus et les bronches.
Et un léger hallucinogčne.
C'est inoffensif.
Je ne comprends pas.
La journaliste, les flics...
Une mise en scčne.
M. Elijah a passé
un accord avec nous.
Pour réduire sa peine de prison.
Vous les voyez.
Vous les voyez plus.
Les derničres choses que Brittany
a vues avant de mourir.
Rien n'était vrai ?
Rien.
Sauf tes aveux.
Et ils sont vrais ŕ perpčte.
Je suis sur le PC de Raines.
Voilŕ l'e-mail.
Mais la vidéo a été effacée.
Effacer des e-mails,
c'est comme perdre ses clés.
lls ne sont pas vraiment perdus.
Des traces magnétiques
subsistent ŕ leur emplacement.
ll suffit de recoller les morceaux.
Voilŕ, ça y est.
C'est Edna Raines.
Elle a pas l'air folle.
Elle l'est peut-ętre pas.
Passez-la vite.
<i>Mlle Par</i>k<i>er, je dois vous parler.</i>
<i>Vous devez tout savoir</i>
<i>de votre mčre et de Mirage.</i>
<i>Veuillez répondre ŕ ce message</i>

<i>Je vous enverrai une adresse.</i>
<i>C'est une question</i>
<i>de vie ou de mort.</i>
Pour Leonard, c'est trop tard.
Espérons qu'il soit encore temps
pour nous trois.
Si on apprend
comment ça s'est fait,
des tętes vont tomber.
A commencer par la mienne.
On a pincé une tueuse d'enfant.
Venez au bureau,
boucler ces monstres.
Ne m'attendez pas.
D'autres obligations ?
Des obligations familiales.

Si j'ai bien compris,
vous achetez des objets personnels
que vous revendez
plus cher à des étrangers ?
L'Amérique est un pays génial,
pas vrai ?
- J'ai une surprise !
- Tu as du boulot ?
A quoi bon,
quand on trouve un truc pareil ?
Un caméscope numérique.
Affichage à cristaux liquides,
machin numérique avec écouteur.
Pas mal !
ça sort de la rivière ?
Exact.
Je l'ai trouvé
près des chutes de Koomer.
On a dû la perdre en tournant
un film d'amateur.
- Je t'en donne 20 $.
- Quoi ?
Je pensais plutôt à 1 00 $.
Et en enfer,
les gens rêvent d'eau glacée !
20 $ et basta !
A prendre ou à laisser.
Vous êtes dure en affaires.
Qu'est-ce qu'un film d'amateur ?
Vous avez grandi dans un placard ?
- Si on veut.
- Vous savez,
papa, maman et les gosses
partent en vacances
et filment ça pour la postérité.
Au cas où quelqu'un voudrait
regarder de son plein gré.
ça me plairait beaucoup.
- Combien ?
- 1 00 $.
Vendu.
Comme je disais, l'Amérique
est un pays génial, pas vrai ?
<i>Mardi 9,</i>
<i>4e jour de vacances. Aujourd'hui,</i>
<i>on commence officiellement</i>
<i>notre pèlerinage du souvenir.</i>
<i>Nous sommes au bord du koomer.</i>
<i>C'est quoi ? Un torrent ?</i>
<i>Un ruisseau. koomer Cree</i>k.
<i>koomer Cree</i>k<i>. En tout cas,</i>
<i>c'est magnifique.</i>
<i>Je pensais que ça serait débile,</i>
<i>mais non.</i>
<i>Ta mère n'est donc pas</i>
<i>totalement abrutie ?</i>
<i>Pas totalement.</i>
<i>Tout ça était à grand-père ?</i>
<i>Oui, c'est là que j'ai grandi.</i>
<i>C'est sur cette souche</i>
<i>que ton père m'a embrassée.</i>
<i>Regarde, c'est encore là !</i>
<i>- Quoi ?</i>
<i>- Regarde.</i>
<i>ll faut filmer ça.</i>
<i>Nanc</i>y <i>et Ted.</i>
<i>Papa m'a parlé</i>
<i>d'un endroit pas loin,</i>
<i>un genre de cabane</i>
<i>où vous pouviez être seuls.</i>
<i>C'est un vieuX moulin.</i>
<i>C'est de là que je viens ?</i>
<i>Comment ça ?</i>
<i>Tu as parlé de mon héritage.</i>
<i>Je me demandais si papa et toi,</i>
<i>vous aviez donné</i>
<i>un nouveau sens</i>
<i>à ''moudre le maïs'' !</i>
<i>- Ecoute...</i>
<i>- Je crois que je brûle !</i>
<i>J'ai oublié mon sac</i>
<i>dans la voiture. Je reviens.</i>
<i>Cet endroit n'est pas nul.</i>
<i>Tu aurais dû m'</i>y <i>emmener avant.</i>
<i>Maman, tu m'écoutes ?</i>
<i>Pour une fois que je suis sérieuse,</i>
<i>elle écoute pas.</i>
<i>Arrêtez ! Non !</i>
<i>ça va, maman ?</i>
<i>Laissez-moi tranquille !</i>
S<i>i c'est une blague,</i>

<i>C'est pas drôle. Où tu es ?</i>

<i>Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?</i>
S<i>auve-toi vite ! ll revient !</i>
<i>A l'aide !</i>
S<i>ilence !</i>
<i>Au secours !</i>
<i>A l'aide, je vous en prie !</i>
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>à cause moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>ll défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
<i>Rapproche-toi du panneau, Leigh.</i>
<i>Pourvu que ça marche.</i>
<i>Lundi 8, 3e jour des vacances.</i>
<i>Et nous sommes à...</i> S<i>lade.</i>
<i>Tu sais quoi, papa ?</i>
<i>Elle va me laisser</i>

<i>C'est du joli,</i>
<i>papa va être content !</i>
<i>Tu es obligée de filmer ça ?</i>
<i>Tu n'as rien à dire ?</i>
<i>J'ai eu un petit accident</i>

<i>ll va falloir changer</i>
<i>un feu arrière.</i>
<i>Et je promets de pa</i>y<i>er.</i>
<i>Je vais prendre de l'essence</i>

<i>On se croirait dans un feuilleton !</i>
<i>Mais il</i> y <i>en a un</i>

<i>Et un qui a un joli cul !</i>
<i>Tiens-toi bien, Leigh.</i>
<i>Comme si tu avais pas remarqué !</i>
<i>Quoi ? J'ai pas remarqué.</i>
Du nouveau sur Jarod ?
Façon de parler.
Toujours ses vieilles ruses
mais une nouvelle méthode.
Tout à fait
dans votre rayon, Broots.
Mon rayon !
Allumez-le.
<i>Bonjour.</i>
<i>J'ai préparé</i>
<i>une petite carte postale</i>
<i>pour te faire plaisir.</i>
<i>Clique et amuse-toi bien.</i>
Génial ! Quand j'irai à Rock City
avec Debbie, je ferai pareil.
<i>Tu connais Edna,</i>
<i>qui malgré un très long séjour</i>
<i>dans un asile</i>
<i>grâce à son épouX dévoué,</i>
<i>est une grande historienne</i>
<i>du Centre.</i>
<i>Edna sait des choses sur ta mère</i>
<i>qu'elle ne veut dire qu'à toi.</i>
<i>Elle veut retrouver sa maison,</i>
<i>mais les netto</i>y<i>eurs</i>
<i>sont à ses trousses.</i>
<i>Elle m'a dit que sa rédemption</i>
<i>serait de te parler</i>
<i>avant qu'on l'attrape.</i>
<i>Alors, dépêche-toi.</i>
<i>Mais attention !</i>
<i>Edna a dit qu'il fallait</i>
<i>que tu continues à creuser,</i>
<i>que le secret que ta mère</i>
<i>voulait te révéler</i>
<i>était enterré quelque part</i>
<i>et que tu devais le trouver.</i>
Le Petit Poucet
sème des miettes électroniques.
On a intérêt à suivre cette trace
avant que quelqu'un n'avale tout.
Et mince !
Vous avez des ennuis ?
Si on veut. Je ne sais pas
ce qui s'est passé.
Je ne vous ai jamais vu.
Je ne fais que passer.
Je ne faisais que passer.
Je crois que je vais rester
un moment.
J.R. est au bout de la route.
Montez, je vais vous pousser.
On verra si on peut vous aider.
Je dois commander les pièces,
on n'en a pas en stock
pour ce genre de voiture.
ça sera pas prêt aujourd'hui.
Je me demande ce qu'elle a.
- L'homme du maïs a frappé.
- Pardon ?
Vous êtes un étranger.
A Slade, ils sont maudits.
La malédiction
de l'homme du maïs.
D'où votre panne de voiture.
Des histoires de bonnes femmes !
Pas du tout.
ça a commencé quand cet étranger
est arrivé il y a longtemps.
L'étranger a découpé
sa famille, toute sa famille.
En minuscules morceaux.
On les a trouvés au moulin.
L'âme de l'homme du maïs
ne connaît pas de repos.
La nuit, elle éclaire le ciel.
Son fantôme hante encore
les étrangers qui viennent ici.
Ferme-la !
Tu peux me dire de la fermer,
l'homme du maïs est quand même là.
J'accorde aucun crédit
à la malédiction de Newt,
mais vous semblez pas
avoir de chance.
J'ai eu un accident
avec deux femmes.
Elles sont passées par là.
Mère et fille, dans une Mustang
rouge décapotable.
Elles étaient belles.
Des blondes.
On aurait dit des soeurs.
ll leur fallait un feu arrière.
J'avais pas ce modèle.
Elles sont parties.
Je les ai pas revues.
Le plein, petit frère.
Facture ça à mon patron.
Me dis pas ce que je dois faire,
grand frère.
C'est ça, l'amour fraternel !
- Le shérif a parlé de vous.
- Les nouvelles vont vite
dans le coin.
On aime se tenir au courant.
Je peux vous aider ?
Vous pourriez
me recommander un motel.
Je vais rester un peu par ici.
Le Clearwater lnn
est le seul de la ville.
ll travaille qu'avec les routiers,
mais c'est propre.
- Je peux vous déposer.
- lnutile.
Je préfère marcher.
Comme ça, je verrai la ville.
Ne clignez pas des yeux.
Vous la rateriez.
L'homme du maïs a frappé.
<i>Clearwater lnn !</i>
<i>Je rêvais de descendre</i>
<i>dans un zéro étoile.</i>
<i>Essaie d'être gentille</i>
<i>5 minutes.</i>
<i>Mais je suis gentille !</i>
<i>Bienvenue au Clearwater lnn.</i>
<i>Vous avez la chambre 1 4.</i>
<i>- Va pour la chambre 1 4.</i>
<i>- La suite présidentielle.</i>
<i>Quel Président est descendu ici ?</i>
<i>Millard fillmore ?</i>
<i>Je l'appelle comme ça</i>
<i>pour faire pa</i>y<i>er plus cher</i>
<i>auX gamines effrontées</i>
<i>et à leurs mères.</i>
<i>Malin !</i>
<i>Je suis sûre</i>
<i>que ce sera parfait.</i>
<i>Merci, Ra</i>y<i>mond. On</i> y <i>va.</i>
Je voudrais une chambre.
Remplissez ça.
Notez bien le modèle
de votre voiture.
J'en louerai une.
A deux rues, par là.
- Bonne chance pour la voiture !
- Peu importe.
Je veux juste me balader.
La région est belle.
ça dépend pour qui.
Des amies à moi ont bien aimé.
En fait, elles ont dû dormir ici.
Une mère et sa fille.
Belles, blondes.
Je m'en souviens pas.
Vous n'avez que des routiers ici.
Vous devez vous souvenir
de deux femmes en décapotable !
C'est ce que vous croyez.
Mais elles sont pas descendues ici.
Vous avez la chambre 5.
Je voudrais la 1 4.
Mon nombre préféré.
Entendu.
Va pour la 1 4.
Quelqu'un se renseigne sur elles.
ll connaissait
leur numéro de chambre.
<i>Tu crois auX fantômes ?</i>
<i>Les âmes des morts qui reviennent</i>
<i>- hanter les vivants.</i>
<i>- Je ne sais pas.</i>
<i>Je n'</i>y <i>ai jamais pensé.</i>
<i>Alors, comment tu eXpliques</i>
<i>ces éclairs ?</i>
<i>C'est dû à la chaleur</i>
<i>et ça se produit depuis longtemps.</i>
<i>En tout cas, c'est flippant.</i>
<i>Comme l'histoire du t</i>y<i>pe</i>
<i>à la station-service.</i>
<i>Celui qui m'a donné ça.</i>
<i>ll m'a parlé de la malédiction.</i>
<i>Tous les étrangers sont maudits.</i>
<i>Tout a commencé quand l'homme</i>
<i>du maïs a découpé une famille.</i>
<i>Ce n'est qu'une vieille légende</i>
<i>qu'on raconte.</i>
<i>C'est ridicule.</i>
<i>- J'espère.</i>
<i>- Je t'assure.</i>
<i>Comment on éteint ça, déjà ?</i>
<i>Le petit bouton rouge.</i>
<i>- ll</i> y <i>a quelqu'un dehors.</i>
<i>- Où ça ?</i>
<i>Près de l'arbre.</i>
<i>ll me regardait fiXement.</i>
<i>Je ne vois personne.</i>
<i>ll était près de l'arbre,</i>
<i>je te jure.</i>
S<i>'il</i> y <i>avait quelqu'un,</i>
<i>il est parti.</i>
<i>ll avait dit qu'on serait</i>
<i>en danger. ll avait raison.</i>
<i>C'est peut-être</i>
<i>l'homme du maïs.</i>
<i>ça ne se produira pas.</i>
<i>Va te coucher.</i>
<i>Comment ça s'éteint ?</i>
<i>Une adolescente est trouvée</i>
<i>assassinée dans sa chambre.</i>
<i>Bourgeoisie d'une petite ville.</i>
<i>On ignore ce qui s'est passé</i>
<i>quand elle a quitté ses amis.</i>
<i>- Que dois-je faire,</i> Sy<i>dne</i>y <i>?</i>
- S<i>ers-toi des preuves.</i>
<i>Utilise tes dons de Caméléon,</i>
<i>deviens la victime.</i>
<i>fais ce qu'elle a fait,</i>
<i>éprouve ce qu'elle a éprouvé.</i>
<i>Mardi 9, 4e jour de vacances.</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui,</i>
<i>on commence officiellement</i>
<i>notre pèlerinage du souvenir.</i>
<i>Nous sommes au bord du koomer.</i>
<i>- Un torrent...</i>
<i>- Un ruisseau. koomer Cree</i>k.
<i>En tout cas, c'est magnifique.</i>
<i>C'est là que j'ai grandi.</i>
<i>Cet endroit n'est pas nul.</i>
<i>Tu aurais dû m'</i>y <i>emmener avant.</i>
<i>Arrêtez ! Non !</i>
<i>- Laissez-moi tranquille.</i>
<i>- ça va ?</i>
<i>- Au secours !</i>
<i>- ça va, maman ?</i>
<i>C'est pas drôle. Où tu es ?</i>
<i>ça va ?</i>
S<i>auve-toi vite. ll revient !</i>
<i>Je n'</i>y <i>arrive pas.</i>
<i>ll faut que tu</i> y <i>arrives.</i>
<i>La famille compte sur toi.</i>
<i>A l'aide !</i>
<i>L'homme du maïs a frappé.</i>
Vous pouvez repartir.
ll paraît que c'est jamais arrivé
avec ce modèle.
En effet, c'est drôle.
Pas quand on est étranger.
C'est la malédiction.
Je vous ai fait ce bonhomme
de maïs pour vous protéger.
Si vous restez ici,
vous en aurez besoin.
Merci...
Je crois.
Je vois que Kent
a tout réparé, M...
J'ai pas retenu votre nom.
Je vous l'ai pas donné.
- Vous partez ?
- Qui sait ?
Je vais peut-être rester.
Je m'attache à cet endroit.
Vous avez pas de boulot ?
Je suis entre deux trucs.
Un conseil :
choisissez l'un ou l'autre.
L'oisiveté
est mère de tous les vices.
Je compte pas rester oisif.
J'aime pas trop les étrangers.
Pourvu que l'homme du maïs
l'attrape pas.
Vous avez retrouvé Edna ?
J'ai agrandi la photo
de l'e-mail de Jarod.
Personne d'identifiable
dans la foule.
Mais vu les plaques
d'immatriculation,
c'est une rue de New y ork.
Quelque part dans Harlem.
<i>Edna veut retrouver sa maison,</i>
<i>mais les netto</i>y<i>eurs</i>
<i>sont à ses trousses.</i>
<i>Elle m'a dit que sa rédemption</i>
<i>serait de te parler</i>
<i>avant qu'on l'attrape.</i>
<i>- Dépêche-toi.</i>
- Sa maison...
La rédemption...
Bien sûr !
Ma mère avait créé
un foyer d'accueil à Harlem,
la ''Maison de la rédemption''.
Jarod vous dit qu'Edna est là-bas.
M. Wright ?
Je veux parler
de votre femme et votre fille.
ll y a eu des ennuis.
Comment ça ?
Je viens de leur parler.
Quand ?
Ce matin.
Elles allaient bien.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
On a eu un accrochage en voiture.
C'est bizarre,
Nancy ne m'a rien dit.
En effet, c'est bizarre.
Cette voiture
semble compter pour vous.
En fait, c'était votre fille
qui conduisait. Leigh...
Elle m'a percuté en reculant.
Votre femme
m'a donné les coordonnées
de l'assurance. Je les ai perdues.
Elle doit rentrer bientôt ?
Non. Elles sont en voyage.
Je suis assuré par Western Mutual.
Je préfère m'en occuper.
Faites faire un devis,
je vous enverrai
un chèque.
Oui, mais je...
Je vous contacterai.
Quelqu'un est venu.
ll s'est renseigné sur elles.
Grand, brun...
<i>Double indemnité</i>
<i>4 millions pour mort accidentelle</i>
Edna est dans ce bâtiment.
lci, chambre 24.
Le type a dit que j'étais le 2e
à la demander en une demi-heure.
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez là ?
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez là ?
C'était ma femme.
- C'était ?
- Edna Raines
est morte.
Une surdose.
Comme ça tombe bien !
Ce monde devait
lui être insupportable.
Avec vous, on la comprend !
Elle me manque tellement.
C'est pour ça que vous l'avez
enfermée pendant 30 ans ?
C'était pour la protéger.
Vous n'avez jamais protégé
que vous, Raines.
Vous pouvez l'enterrer à nouveau.
Avec tous les secrets
pour lesquels elle est morte.
ll faut qu'on parle.
Un instant, monsieur.
Bureau du shérif. Comment ?
Non, votre frère n'est pas là.
C'est mon adjoint, Kent.
ll est en patrouille.
Je lui dirai de vous appeler
quand il rentrera. D'accord.
Excusez-moi.
Quel est le problème ?
J'ai trouvé quelque chose...
Bureau du shérif.
Je ne peux pas parler.
Je comprends.
Je te rappelle.
Très vite.
Ne bouge pas.
Réveillez-vous.
Réveillez-vous, j'ai dit !
Parlez !
De quoi ?
De ce que vous savez
de Nancy et Leigh.
Depuis le début.
Elles ont disparu il y a 4 jours
et M. Wright
a souscrit une forte police
d'assurance sur elles.
Qu'est-ce que vous racontez ?
Le shérif et vous avez comploté
pour tuer
votre femme et votre fille
- et toucher la prime.
- Un meurtre ?
- On veut les sauver.
- En tentant de me tuer ?
On vous a trouvé !
Vous les avez enlevées.
Dites-moi où elles sont.
Je suis là pour les retrouver.
ll y a un caméscope avec
une cassette. ça explique tout.
<i>- ça va ?</i>
- S<i>auve-toi.</i>
S<i>auve-toi. ll revient !</i>
<i>Au secours !</i>
<i>A l'aide !</i>
Mon Dieu !
Vous êtes qui ?
J'étais en vacances
et ça m'est tombé dessus.
- Jarod Wilson.
- Un flic !
- S'il apprend, il les tuera.
- Quoi ?
ll y a 4 jours,
un homme m'a appelé.
ll a dit que si je voulais
revoir ma famille,
je devais trouver 500 000 $
d'ici ce soir.
Et ne pas contacter la police.
Ted m'a fait promettre
de ne pas demander
d'aide extérieure.
On est amis depuis le lycée,
Raymond, lui et moi.
Vous avez commencé à fouiner,
on vous a cru impliqué.
C'est quelqu'un de la région ?
Les gens du coin connaissent
la réussite financière de Ted
et sa famille. A vrai dire,
on a peu d'éléments.
Et encore moins de temps.
J'étais l'analyste
d'Edna Raines.
Elle n'aurait pas décidé
de mourir, pas de son plein gré.
Edna se savait en danger.
D'où les énigmes de Jarod
pour la localiser.
<i>Attention ! Edna a dit</i>
<i>qu'il fallait</i>
<i>que tu continues à creuser,</i>
<i>que le secret que ta mère</i>
<i>voulait te révéler</i>
<i>était enterré quelque part</i>
<i>et que tu devais</i>
<i>- le trouver.</i>
- Enterré...
- Mais où ?
- Qui est le plus susceptible
d'enterrer des choses ici ?
J'ai l'argent.
Tout est prêt.
ll aurait dû appeler
pour me donner rendez-vous.
ll va appeler. Soyez patient.
Je veux pas être patient,
je veux revoir ma famille.
ll est dans notre camp.
Retenez-le le plus possible.
Exigez de parler à Nancy.
Dites que vous ne paierez pas
sans la savoir en vie.
lci Wright.
Mettez l'argent dans un sac.
A minuit, vous viendrez seul
<i>et le laisserez dans la poubelle</i>
<i>près du pont de Walnut.</i>
Je veux parler à ma femme.
Vous n'êtes pas en position
d'avoir des exigences.
Pas question d'échanger
500 000 $ contre deux cadavres.
Dieu merci !
Leigh et toi,
vous allez bien ?
On est un peu moulues,
mais on est en vie.
Tout va s'arranger, chérie.
Je t'aime, Ted.
Moi aussi.
Je vous aime toutes les deux.
Minuit.
J'y serai.
C'est bon !
<i>J'ai déposé l'argent.</i>
ça fait plus d'une heure.
Je n'ai encore rien vu.
<i>- Et toi, Ra</i>y<i>mond ?</i>
<i>- Tu as vu quelque chose ?</i>
- Rien.
<i>- Ouvre l'oeil.</i>
Je n'aime pas ça, shérif.
<i>ll aurait dû venir.</i>
<i>Je crois avoir quelque chose !</i>
Raymond ?
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
J'ai vu le type foncer sur moi.
ll était à moto.
Je pensais pouvoir l'arrêter.
Et je me suis retrouvé
par terre.
La balle est entrée par derrière.
Comment c'est possible ?
ll y a deux ravisseurs.
Plus jamais. Vous m'entendez ?
Calmez-vous
et inspectez votre pantalon.
- Qu'avez-vous trouvé ?
- Rien.
Enfin, presque rien.
J'ai étudié les dossiers
de Raines liés à Edna.
Et la seule chose
que j'aie trouvée, c'est section
G-1 4-6 dans un message
d'Edna à vous
intercepté par Raines.
Section G...
allée 1 4, travée 6.
C'est la tombe de ma mère.
L'e-mail de Jarod
disait de creuser.
Les réponses
sont enterrées là-bas.
Jarod voudrait
que vous l'exhumiez ?
C'est la tombe de votre mère,
Mlle Parker.
Prenez des pelles.
On a du travail.
Elles sont mortes.
Si les ravisseurs les ont pas
déjà tuées, ils vont le faire.
Quelque chose
m'a peut-être échappé.
<i>Tu aurais dû m'</i>y <i>emmener avant.</i>
<i>ça va ?</i> S<i>i c'est une blague,</i>
<i>c'est pas drôle !</i>
<i>Pas totalement.</i>
<i>J'ai étudié les preuves,</i>
<i>lu les rapports,</i>
<i>mais ça n'est pas logique.</i>
<i>La réponse est sous tes</i> y<i>euX.</i>
<i>Tout ce qu'il te faut est là.</i>
<i>- Je ne vois pas ce que c'est.</i>
<i>- Elle, si.</i>
<i>Vois ce qu'elle voit.</i>
<i>Regarde, Jarod. Regarde bien.</i>
Vous avez vu ?
<i>La réponse est là.</i>
<i>Elle a toujours été là.</i>
<i>Elle le voit.</i>
Adams !
ll était dans le parking ?
Qui est Adams ?
Mon adjoint.
- Et un des ravisseurs.
- Qui est l'autre ?
Je parie sur son frère Kent,
de la station-service.
Ces types vont tuer ma famille ?
Pas si on les attrape d'abord.
Ecoutez ça.
<i>- ça va ?</i>
<i>- On est un peu moulues,</i>
<i>mais on est en vie.</i>
- Je ne comprends pas.
- ''Moulues''.
Leigh parlait
d'un vieux moulin.
Près du ranch de mon beau-père.
J'y allais toujours avec Nancy.
Votre femme voulait vous dire
où elles sont.
Allons-y.
Pourvu qu'elles soient
encore en vie.
Vous m'avez fait faire
beaucoup de choses,
mais celle-ci
est la pire de toutes.
Et si quelqu'un nous voit ?
Vous le retiendrez,
j'irai chercher de l'aide.
C'est parfait !
L'allée 1 4 est par là.
J'ai l'impression
de jouer dans Scoubidou.
Qu'est-ce que c'était ?
Pas d'affolement, trouillard.
C'est une chouette.
C'est là.
Ce n'est pas bien.
Vous êtes sûre
de vouloir faire ça ?
Jarod a fait pas mal
de choses tordues.
Mais il ne m'amènerait pas ici
pour me torturer.
Creusez.
Où tu étais ?
Wright a parlé au shérif.
On se tire.
Personne ne m'a suivi.
J'ai tiré
sur celui qui l'aurait fait.
Et elles ?
C'était pas prévu comme ça.
ça a changé, petit frère.
Elles peuvent nous identifier.
Sauve-toi !
Je m'occupe de la fille
et toi, d'elle.
ça fait mal, maman !
Si tu le prends comme ça...
ça m'étonnerait.
Je vais bien, mais Leigh
s'est enfuie.
L'adjoint la poursuit.
Tu peux pas t'en tirer.
Lâchez-moi !
ça marche pas comme ça.
- ça n'a rien de personnel.
- Je veux rentrer chez moi.
C'est purement professionnel.
Je veux rentrer chez moi.
Tu vas finir dans Koomer Creek.
Personne ne peut t'entendre crier.
Moi, si.
ça va ?
Tout va bien.
Comment vous remercier ?
Prenez soin d'elles.
Ce sera fait.
Prête ?
On rentre à la maison.
ça y est.
Vous tenez à faire ça ?
Ouvrez.
Allons-nous-en
et laissons-la reposer en paix.
C'est moi
qui veux reposer en paix !
Ouvrez.
Vous êtes sûre ?
Allez-y.
Mon Dieu !
- Quoi ?
- Mlle Parker, votre mère...
elle n'est pas là.
Mais alors, elle est où ?
<i>Je ne te le demanderai</i>
<i>qu'une fois, Jarod.</i>
<i>Comment tu savais</i>
<i>qu'elle n'était pas là ?</i>
Je l'ignorais.
<i>- Alors, qui ?</i>
- Edna savait.
<i>Elle connaissait tous les secrets,</i>
- surtout au sujet de Mirage.
<i>- Hélas,</i>
- elle les emporte dans la tombe.
<i>- Désolé.</i>
On pouvait faire confiance
à Edna.
Contrairement au Centre.
Ou à ma famille.
Tu avais raison
de faire confiance à ta mère.
Elle connaissait
l'importance de la famille.
<i>Elle aidait les gens.</i>
Si elle avait des secrets,
c'était pour te protéger.
Me protéger de quoi ?
De la vérité.
<i>Continue à chercher.</i>
N'oublie pas, il ne faut pas
croire tout ce qu'on voit.
Après tout,
la vie n'est qu'un mirage.
Parfois,
les choses les plus effrayantes
peuvent nous sauver la vie.

<i>Edna Raines sait des choses</i>
<i>sur ta mčre.</i>
<i>Je dois vous parler</i>
<i>de votre mčre et de Mirage.</i>
<i>C'est une question</i>
<i>de vie ou de mort.</i>
<i>- Edna Raines est morte.</i>
<i>- Elle savait tout,</i>
<i>surtout sur le projet Mirage.</i>
<i>- Jarod a dit de creuser.</i>
<i>- C'est la tombe de votre mčre.</i>
<i>Mlle Par</i>k<i>er, votre mčre...</i>
<i>Elle n'est pas lŕ !</i>
<i>Mais alors, elle est oů ?</i>
Tout le monde est allé
une fois en vacances.
Je te jure.
Je n'ai jamais pris de vacances.
Pas męme...
au Mont Rushmore ?
Au Fort Alamo ?
Et aux chutes du Niagara ?
Je m'en souviendrais.
Mais j'ai mangé chez Stookey's,
sur la 65e.
- ça compte ?
- S<i>tuc</i>k<i>e</i>y<i>'s.</i>
T'as goűté la bűche ?
- C'est quoi, une bűche ?
- T'as jamais pris de vacances.
Pas besoin de vacances.
Je t'ai, toi.
Tu es totalement guérie ?
Oui. La sécu doit l'avoir mauvaise,
c'est pas grave.
Me sors pas les violons.
C'est mon visiophone.
Je reviens.
S<i>alut, fils.</i>
Je te cherche depuis un an.
Oů étais-tu ?
<i>J'ai dű me cacher un peu,</i>
<i>avec le petit.</i>
<i>On t'a cherché, nous aussi,</i>
<i>en vain.</i>
<i>Et puis,</i>
<i>grâce ŕ un tu</i>y<i>au anon</i>y<i>me,</i>
<i>j'ai décr</i>y<i>pté ton mot de passe</i>
<i>et me voilŕ.</i>
Vous allez bien ?
<i>Dieu merci,</i>
<i>le petit et moi allons bien.</i>
C'est plus ou moins mon frčre.
Je t'expliquerai un jour.
C'est Zoey.
Mon pčre.
Jarod était inquiet pour vous.
Beau gosse.
C'est vraiment ton pčre ?
Je te verrai bientôt ?
S<i>o</i>y<i>ons prudents.</i>
<i>Je me méfie de cette ligne</i>
<i>alors, je serai bref.</i>
<i>J'ai retrouvé Emil</i>y.
<i>J'ai retrouvé ta soeur.</i>
Quoi ? Comment ?
Oů est-elle ?
Elle est reporter au Philadelphia
Examiner. Par prudence,
<i>j'ai laissé les détails</i>
<i>sur ton e-mail sécurisé.</i>
<i>Elle m'a dit qu'elle avait</i>
<i>presque retrouvé ta trace.</i>
<i>Ramčne-la-moi.</i>
Bien sűr !
<i>Bonne chance.</i>
<i>Tiens-moi au courant.</i>
J'ai retrouvé mon pčre !
Et ma soeur qu'on cherchait
depuis si longtemps...
- Et nos vacances ?
- Elles attendront.
On aura tout le temps,
si ça ne tient qu'ŕ moi.
Tout le temps du monde.
Ne me sors pas les violons.
Va retrouver ta soeur.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Une journaliste a été agressée
et défenestrée.
Emily quelque chose.
- Aidez-moi.
- Je suis lŕ pour ça.
Je vais t'aider.
Je suis Jarod.
Ton frčre.
- Jarod.
- Reste avec moi.
Appelez une ambulance !
<i>On m'a enlevé ŕ ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjŕ</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>ŕ cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>ll défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous ętes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
Pupilles non réactives,
respiration superficielle.
Pouls faible et filant.
Risque de traumatisme crânien
et de fractures multiples.
On la stabilise
avec une lV de cibacalcine.
Appelez la radio
pour un scanner
abdominal et crânien.
Qui l'a réanimée ?
Moi.
Vous l'avez peut-ętre sauvée.
Vous ętes médecin ?
Je suis du FBl.
La victime était connue
de nos services.
Pourquoi ?
Disons que ses articles
avaient dérangé, ŕ Washington.
Le bureau de la victime est lŕ.
lnspecteur Brucketts.
Appelez-moi Stan.
Agent Jarod Curtis.
Dites-moi tout ce que vous savez.
La victime est arrivée
tôt ce matin.
Si tôt que c'est le gardien de nuit
qui l'a trouvée.
A ce que je sais,
on l'a piégée ici
et jetée par cette fenętre.
Deux étages.
Une description ?
Homme blanc, environ 35 ans.
Taille moyenne, costume sombre.
On fait le portrait-robot.
Que tous ses cartons soient scellés
et envoyés au poste.
J'ai besoin d'un bureau
quelques jours.
ll était temps
que tu reviennes, Lyle.
Quel est ton plat du jour,
petit frčre ?
Poules de Malaisie ŕ domicile,
ou quiche cannibale
du Kalahari ?
Si tu veux voir papa,
il est parti.
Trouve-le.
Le tord-boyaux, c'est pas vraiment
le petit-déjeuner des champions.
Tu n'y es pour rien.
Excuse-moi.
Lŕ, je sais que tu es bourrée.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Parker ?
C'est ŕ propos de notre mčre.
Elle a disparu.
Elle est morte depuis longtemps.
Je veux dire : elle n'est pas lŕ.
Son...
Elle n'est pas lŕ ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Tu ne comprendrais pas.
Je veux savoir.
J'imagine.
<i>Boîte vocale 04. Enregistrez.</i>
C'est moi.
J'ai l'impression que Parker sait,
pour la tombe vide de Catherine.
Vous pensez qu'on a volé
le corps de votre mčre ?
A part ce séisme dű au whisky
qui me ravage la tęte,
je ne sais plus que croire.
Avouons que la disparition
du corps de Catherine Parker
coďncide avec d'autres bizarreries.
La réapparition d'Edna Raines,
que tout le monde croyait morte
depuis 30 ans.
Et qui est vraiment morte,
grâce au boucher
- qu'elle appelait ''doudou''.
- Le meurtre
de cet employé, Leonard,
au niveau souterrain 26,
parce qu'il avait vu un mémo.
La tombe vide
de Catherine Parker.
Etrange coďncidence.
Pas une coďncidence.
Mirage.
Mirage ?
Ce dont parlait Edna ?
C'était écrit sur les 2 mémos.
Celui que j'ai vu chez Lyle
et celui qui a tué Leonard.
C'est fort étrange, en effet.
Mais ça ne change pas du Centre.
C'est vous qui dites :
''Le meurtre est une affaire
de routine'' ?
Parfois, il vaut mieux
laisser filer les choses.
- La tombe de ma mčre est vide !
- Peut-ętre
avait-elle d'autres volontés
pour son enterrement.
Parfois, les gens font des choix
durs ŕ expliquer.
Je suis sur un gros poisson.
La meilleure piste,
c'est celle du corps.
En l'occurrence,
celui de ma mčre.
Commençons
par le rapport d'autopsie.
Pourquoi
vous ne laissez pas filer ?
Parce qu'une voix en moi
me dit de le faire.
Et je l'écoute.
Son état reste critique,
agent Curtis.
- Ne la fatiguez pas.
- Soyez tranquille.
C'est ton frčre... Jarod.
Je suis arrivé trop tard ce matin.
Je suis désolé.
Je ne serai plus en retard.
Je te le promets.
<i>Alors, ce tour du monde ?</i>
Comme dirait William Churchill
<i>ou je ne sais plus qui,</i>
le soleil ne se couche jamais
sur le Centre
et il ne se couchera jamais
sur les Parker.
Heureux de l'apprendre.
Pourquoi Raines
reçoit le Triumvirat ?
ll sera dans nos pattes
tant que Mirage fonctionnera.
Malheureusement,
on n'est pas seuls.
J'ai l'impression que frangine
suit la męme piste.
<i>- Mince !</i>
- Elle est loin derričre.
Elle le restera.
Elle ne doit pas savoir,
pour son bien.
Si elle savait la vérité,
elle le regretterait.
Dans quoi j'ai marché ?
Aucune idée, mais en courant,
vous pouvez l'attraper.
Vous avez trouvé
le rapport d'autopsie ?
Pas encore.
D'aprčs Buzzie, pour voir
un DSA du niveau souterrain,
il faut se connecter
ŕ l'unité centrale sur place.
- Qui est Buzzie ?
- Mon pote
au standard, avec le sonotone.
ll a toujours
les oreilles qui bourdonnent.
- Moi aussi.
- Regardez !
On dit que JFK est resté
quelque part dans le coma.
D'aprčs Buzzie,
c'était ici-męme.
Juste ŕ côté
des cadavres d'extraterrestres
que Nixon a montré
ŕ Jackie Gleason.
C'était ici aussi ?
C'est lŕ.
C'est lŕ qu'on a fait
l'autopsie de votre mčre.
ça ne devrait pas ętre long.
- Parker, ça va ?
- ça va, Syd.
ça y est.
<i>Voici le document visuel</i>
<i>intitulé nl566773.</i>
<i>L'autopsie</i>
<i>de Catherine Elaine Par</i>k<i>er.</i>
<i>Date et heure ŕ suivre.</i>
<i>Dr William Raines, médecin légiste.</i>
Quel touche-ŕ-tout, ce Raines !
ll les bat, il les bute
et il les débite.
<i>Le premier eXamen indique</i>
<i>une blessure par balle dans</i>
<i>le crâne comme cause du décčs.</i>
<i>L'angle et l'impact</i>
<i>de cette blessure indiquent</i>
<i>que le coup de feu</i>
<i>a été tiré par la victime.</i>
Allons jusqu'ŕ la fin.
On connaît tous ces mensonges.
C'est le corps qui nous intéresse.
<i>Préparez le corps</i>
<i>pour le transport</i>
<i>selon les volontés de la famille.</i>
<i>A titre personnel,</i>
<i>je voudrais eXprimer ici</i>
<i>mes sincčres remords</i>
<i>et dire que ce fut,</i>
<i>et que ça restera</i>
<i>une mort tragique</i>
<i>dans les annales du Centre,</i>
<i>qui j'espčre</i>
<i>ne se reproduira jamais.</i>
Et maintenant ?
A nous de jouer aux médecins.
Voyons ŕ quel point les remords
du Dr Folamort sont sincčres.
L'agression d'Emily me bouleverse.
Je me sentais proche d'elle.
Elle cherchait sa famille.
Je n'ai jamais connu mes parents.
Je suis désolé.
Elle était sur le point
de changer tout cela pour elle.
Comment ça ?
Elle avait trouvé la piste
de son frčre.
Elle disait qu'elle était
ŕ ça de le trouver.
Elle pleurait quand on en parlait.
Quand avez-vous vu ma...
la victime ?
ll y a deux ou trois nuits.
A vrai dire,
elle semblait un peu tendue.
Elle était sur le point
de faire une grosse découverte.
Le frčre qu'elle cherchait ?
Je ne crois pas.
C'était une chose qui la troublait,
pas une découverte heureuse.
Vous avez trouvé quelque chose ?
Pas sűr.
Merci, mais j'aimerais
jeter un oeil.
Vous m'avez économisé le trajet.
J'allais aller en ville
pour parler ŕ la police
du type qui traînait ici.
Le męme que le portrait-robot
dans le journal.
lls ont oublié le détail
le plus important.
Le fait qu'il lui manquait
un pouce.
Je ne vous connais pas
et vous parlez
de petit-déjeuner ?
M. Lyle ?
Vous n'avez pas lu le journal.
<i>La journaliste agressée</i>
<i>toujours en vie</i>
On veut tuer gentiment
et voilŕ ce qui arrive.
On retourne ŕ Philadelphie.
Vous permettez ?
Je ne vais pas
au niveau souterrain 1 8.
Vous devriez.
C'est une vraie foire aux monstres.
Vous connaissez l'histoire...
Kennedy, les Martiens morts.
La salle oů vous avez
autopsié ma mčre.
J'aimerais pas trimbaler
cette bouteille dans l'escalier.
Tout le monde sait
que j'ai autopsié votre mčre.
Mais tout le monde sait-il
que le corps de ma mčre
n'est pas dans sa tombe ?
Qu'est-ce que vous racontez ?
Qu'avez-vous fait de son corps,
espčce de vampire ?
Ce que tout médecin légiste
aurait fait :
j'ai honoré la volonté
de la défunte.
Si ça vous pose problčme,
adressez-vous ŕ elle.
Cette conversation est terminée.
Vous lui avez parlé
de la tombe vide de votre mčre ?
ll va... ll pourrait...
Nous mener droit ŕ la réponse.
- Vous lui avez dit exprčs ?
- Ce gros poisson...
Je viens de poser l'appât.
Attendons.
Vous ętes des nôtres ?
Navrée, agent Curtis,
la victime ne peut
ętre transférée.
Vous iriez en prison
pour violation d'un ordre fédéral ?
- Cet ordre ne vaut rien.
- J'ai vu sa fiche.
Son état est stable,
ses fonctions vitales aussi.
La réponse reste non.
Celui qui a tenté de la tuer
reviendra finir le travail.
Je vous le garantis.
Je ne peux la laisser
qu'ŕ un parent.
Et jusqu'ŕ présent,
il ne s'en est pas présenté.
Jusqu'ŕ présent.
Je suis le pčre d'Emily.
Vous devriez écouter cet agent.
Je prépare son départ.
- Content de te voir.
- Comment va-t-elle ?
Elle s'en tirera.
Willie, par l'escalier.
Vous, suivez-moi.
- lls étaient combien ?
- Quatre.
238.
Oů elle est passée ?
Sortie.
- A l'instant.
- L'escalier.
Cette ambulance est ŕ moi.
Je connais un endroit sűr.
Conduis.
Tu veux mourir ?
Dégage de lŕ.
Vous avez vu cette femme ?
Non, jamais vu.
Merci pour tout, soeur Mary.
Vous nous avez tant aidées,
restez tant que vous voulez.
Emily sera bien soignée.
<i>Programme fédéral</i>
<i>d'identification</i>
<i>Aucune réponse</i>
Rien.
Pas de chance ?
Comme s'il n'existait pas.
Qui que ce soit,
Emily était sur sa trace.
Je vais t'aider avec les notes.
''Troubles de la personnalité,
''homme sans nom.''
''Parle ŕ des voix. Enigme.''
C'est peut-ętre pour un article.
Ou un mystčre
qu'elle cherche ŕ résoudre.
Elle a cru que c'était toi.
Elle a cherché, comme moi.
Comme nous tous.
Pourquoi le Centre
voulait la tuer ?
Et quel rôle il joue ?
Vous avez lancé un hameçon
et il a gobé toute la ligne.
Je n'imaginais pas Raines
en campagnard.
Au milieu de nulle part,
on n'entend pas crier.
Allons voir ce feu.
Alors, Broots ?
Ce sont tous les souvenirs
de Raines.
De vieux papiers d'hypothčque
ŕ ses dessins de maternelle.
Un vrai Monet.
Ethan. Son fils ?
J'ai ménagé mes synapses
en oubliant la famille Raines.
Raines aurait vécu ici ?
On lui rendait parfois visite,
mais c'était loin d'ici.
ll se servait peut-ętre
de cette maison
pour stocker des effets personnels.
Malgré les talents de ce petit,
je crois qu'on est
dans une impasse.
Je crois que j'ai trouvé une issue.
La médaille de saint Christophe.
Mlle Parker, regardez.
<i>Mon frčre ?</i>
C'est moi, Em.
C'est ton frčre.
- Jarod ?
- Papa est lŕ, aussi.
Nous voilŕ réunis.
Prends ton temps.
Que veux-tu nous dire ?
J'ai trouvé cette photo
dans tes dossiers.
Tu as cru que c'était moi ?
Qui est-ce ?
Ethan.
ll entend des voix.
ll parle...
ll parle aux voix.
J'ai lu tes notes. Quelles voix ?
Elle a besoin de repos.
NuGenesis.
NuGenesis ? Mon Dieu !
La clinique
de fécondation du Centre.
J'en garde un mauvais souvenir.
Tiens.
AA-8585.
C'est un numéro de dossier ?
De NuGenesis ?
C'est lié ŕ cet homme, Ethan ?
Suivez NuGenesis.
Suivez-le.
Suivez-le.
Si vous vous considérez
comme son ami,
vous détruirez ces disques.
Et tout de suite.
Je ne peux pas.
Je n'ai pas vraiment le choix.
C'est la vie de Mlle Parker.
Son passé.
Elle a le droit de le voir.
Voir quoi ?
Faites comme bon vous semble.
Je ne vous aiderai pas
ŕ ouvrir la boîte de Pandore.
Quelle boîte de Pandore ?
J'ai pu reconstituer
une partie des disques
qu'on a trouvés chez Raines.
- Oů on était aujourd'hui ?
- Regardez.
<i>J'espčre que vous serez bien ici,</i>
<i>aprčs tout</i>
<i>ce que vous avez enduré.</i>
<i>Je n'imaginais pas vous remercier</i>
<i>un jour de votre bonté,</i>
<i>mais merci.</i>
Ma mčre est allée lŕ-bas.
Oui, mais regardez la date.
Regardez la date
affichée sur le DSA.
Votre mčre a été tuée
au Centre en avril.
lci, c'est daté de juin.
Sűrement une erreur.
C'est impossible
de modifier la date
des DSA du Centre.
Sydney ne voulait pas
que je vous montre ça,
mais votre mčre n'est pas morte
dans cet ascenseur, Mlle Parker.
Ma mčre serait encore en vie ?
Votre mčre en vie ?
Est-ce que ça a un sens ?
- C'était ŕ elle ?
- Je ne m'en souviens pas.
Continuez ŕ décrypter
les archives de chez Raines.
Et n'en parlez ŕ personne.
- Męme ŕ Sydney.
- Surtout ŕ Sydney.
ll m'aurait mis des menottes
pour m'empęcher de trouver ça.
A qui vous fier ?
Oů est Angelo ?
ça me rappelle
la folie de mon enfance.
Tu es sűr que c'est
l'adresse d'Ethan ?
Certain.
ll se filme depuis des années.
Rien sur NuGenesis AA-8585 ?
Non, mais il y a assez
de matériel
pour écrire un manuel sur les
explosifs. ll est allé plus loin.
ll construit sa propre bombe.
Regarde. Une lettre non postée.
A ses parents.
Les Clausen.
D'aprčs le time-code,
la vidéo date de moins d'une heure.
Voilŕ notre artificier.
Voyons ce qu'il mijote.
<i>Laissez-moi tranquille !</i>
A qui il parle ?
<i>Je sais qu'il faut pas crier.</i>
<i>Je serai sage, maintenant.</i>
D'aprčs les notes d'Emily,
il y a des signes
de comportement erratique
et de schizophrénie.
ll doit lutter avec ses démons.
Emily dit qu'il entend des voix.
Va savoir ce que ça veut dire.
<i>Ecoutez, j'ai des ennuis.</i>
<i>Je dois vous parler.</i>
<i>J'ai presque terminé</i>
<i>76-77.</i>
<i>ll me manque quelques pičces,</i>
<i>mais je dois vous parler.</i>
<i>Aprčs l'eXplosion,</i>
<i>la douleur s'en ira ?</i>
lls lui promettent
que ses tourments cesseront
s'il pose une bombe pour eux.
- Le Centre.
- Qui d'autre ?
<i>D'accord.</i>
<i>Mais je veuX voir mes parents.</i>
<i>Laissez-moi les voir.</i>
<i>ça fait si longtemps.</i>
<i>Je leur ai écrit une lettre.</i>
<i>Pourquoi je ne peuX pas</i>
<i>la poster ?</i>
<i>lls m'aiment !</i>
<i>Je sais.</i>
<i>Je sais que vous aussi.</i>
<i>Quoi ?</i>
<i>- Vous ętes sűr ?</i>
- Que fait-il ?
<i>ll parle auX voiX.</i>
<i>ll va faire du mal</i>
<i>ŕ mes parents ?</i>
<i>ll ne peut pas</i>
<i>leur faire de mal.</i>
Oů qu'il aille,
il ne reviendra pas.
ll a pris sa bombe avec lui.
Allons-y.
Ce n'est pas ma faute
si Jarod a trouvé sa soeur
avant nous.
<i>C'est ta faute</i>
<i>si elle est encore en vie.</i>
Tu ne disais pas
de suivre le courant ?
<i>Pas au point de te no</i>y<i>er.</i>
<i>Et Mirage ?</i>
- On cherche toujours.
<i>- Parfait !</i>
<i>Ma fille chasse un fantôme,</i>
<i>mon fils chasse un monstre.</i>
<i>Le dernier survivant a gagné.</i>
Secrets et mensonges.
Secrets et mensonges.
Au Centre, secrets et mensonges
sont comme de l'oxygčne.
Mensonges.
Concentre-toi sur ça.
ça appartenait peut-ętre
ŕ ma mčre.
Elle a porté ça.
Son voyage pas terminé.
Ma mčre est toujours en vie ?
Les illusions sont réelles.
Comment ça ?
Les mirages sont réels.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que Mirage ?
Les mirages sont réels.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
ll est dans votre camp.
Angelo désolé.
ll ne connaît pas les réponses.
Mais Sydney sait.
Sydney connaît tous les secrets
et les mensonges.
Ne mourez pas !
Ne me quittez pas !
Ne me quittez pas !
C'est vous.
Je jure que non.
Vous les avez tués !
- Pourquoi ?
- Ethan,
je ne leur ai rien fait.
Je ne les ai pas tués.
On leur a fait du mal.
On a tué mes parents !
Laisse-moi t'aider.
M'aider ?
Ma soeur, Emily...
elle t'a suivi car elle voulait
t'aider. Je ne cherche
rien d'autre.
On ne peut pas m'aider.
Pas vous.
Une seule personne peut m'aider.
- Pas un geste.
- Je suis du FBl.
Tout va bien.
- On a signalé des coups de feu.
- Lŕ-haut.
Deux morts.
Je suis arrivé trop tard.
Vous saviez ma mčre en vie
et vous ne m'avez rien dit ?
Donnez-moi une raison
de ne pas vous brűler la cervelle.
Je lui ai promis
de ne rien vous dire.
Comme vous savez,
j'ai donné ŕ votre mčre
sa derničre séance d'analyse
moins d'une heure avant
son présumé assassinat...
son présumé suicide
dans l'ascenseur.
''Présumé.''
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
<i>Catherine, détendez-vous.</i>
Sy<i>dne</i>y<i>, je viens d'apprendre</i>
<i>que quelqu'un que j'aime</i>
<i>veut me tuer.</i>
<i>- Qui ?</i>
<i>- Je ne peuX rien dire. Un ami.</i>
<i>Cela m'oblige</i>
<i>ŕ prendre une décision</i>
<i>trčs difficile.</i>
<i>Je vais simuler ma mort</i>
<i>dans l'espoir de rester en vie.</i>
<i>- EXpliquez-vous.</i>
<i>- Je n'ai pas le temps,</i>
<i>mais vous connaissez ces gens.</i>
<i>- Malheureusement.</i>
<i>- Depuis peu,</i>
<i>ils travaillent sur un projet</i>
<i>appelé Mirage,</i>
<i>dont je suis</i>
<i>une pičce essentielle.</i>
<i>Mon seul mo</i>y<i>en d'</i>y <i>échapper</i>
<i>est de mourir.</i>
<i>Par un meurtre ou un suicide.</i>
<i>Vos propos sont dangereuX.</i>
<i>L'époque est dangereuse.</i>
<i>Je ferai tout pour survivre.</i>
<i>Et je reviendrai sauver Jarod</i>
<i>et Angelo. Et ma petite fille.</i>
<i>Que deviendra-t-elle ?</i>
<i>C'est un don du ciel.</i>
<i>Je ne sais pas comment la sauver</i>
<i>sans lui causer un tel chagrin.</i>
<i>Promettez-moi,</i> Sy<i>dne</i>y<i>,</i>
<i>jurez-moi de la protéger,</i>
<i>de ne jamais lui parler de ça.</i>
<i>Vous me le devez.</i>
<i>- Je le sais.</i>
<i>- Quoi qu'il arrive,</i>
<i>męme si elle veut savoir,</i>
<i>elle ne doit pas connaître</i>
<i>la véritable tragédie</i>
<i>du secret de sa famille.</i>
<i>Promettez-moi.</i>
<i>Je vous le promets.</i>
<i>Bonne chance, Catherine.</i>
1 h plus tard,
le coup de feu a retenti.
Vous connaissez la suite.
Je n'ai jamais revu Catherine.
Vous savez ce que c'est ?
Mirage... La tragédie...
du secret de ma famille ?
Hélas, non.
C'est la vérité.
On a tué les parents d'Ethan
pour lui adresser un message.
''Termine l'attentat
ŕ la bombe 76-77, sinon...''
ça ressemble ŕ un message
du Centre.
- C'est signé.
- ça aussi.
Tu es entré
sur le serveur de NuGenesis ?
Et tu ne croiras pas
ce que j'ai trouvé
dans le dossier AA-8585.
AA-8585 était un transfert
de sperme conservé par cryogénie.
ll a été envoyé au Centre
il y a des décennies.
Quelqu'un voulait absolument
un bébé.
Ce n'était pas
n'importe quel sperme.
C'était le mien.
- Que sait Jarod ?
- On ne sait pas trop.
<i>Mais le fichier du Major Charles</i>
<i>a été piraté ŕ NuGenesis.</i>
<i>Et Jarod a été vu</i>
<i>chez les parents.</i>
Avant ou aprčs le meurtre ?
Aprčs, Dieu merci.
<i>Et Mirage ?</i>
ll court toujours.
<i>ll</i> y <i>a sűrement un mo</i>y<i>en</i>
d'empęcher Jarod de le trouver.
<i>ll</i> y <i>en a un.</i>
On lui donne quelque chose
de plus important ŕ suivre.
<i>Quelque chose du nom de...</i>
<i>Zoe</i>y.
Bien raisonné, M. Cox.
C'est de plus en plus bizarre.
Du nouveau sur tes fichiers
ŕ NuGenesis ?
Depuis 25 ans,
des tests génétiques comparatifs
ont été pratiqués avec mon ADN.
Reste ŕ savoir ŕ qui ou ŕ quoi
ils l'ont comparé.
ça n'est pas dit. Les résultats
ont été envoyés dans une maison
de Blue Cove, Delaware.
Allons-y.
ça va ?
J'ai une impression bizarre.
Avec M. Raines,
c'est censé ętre bizarre.
Plus bizarre que ça.
Que cherche-t-on ?
La vérité.
Je vais voir par lŕ.
Ce n'est pas par lŕ.
Comment le sais-tu ?
Je ne sais pas.
J'ai une impression de déjŕ-vu.
Que marmonnez-vous ?
J'ai décrypté les disques
de la maison de Raines et...
Si une image vaut mille mots,
j'ai mis le doigt sur un Thesaurus.
C'est 6 mois
aprčs la ''mort'' de votre mčre.
<i>ll va bientôt arriver.</i>
<i>Vous tenez ŕ faire ça ?</i>
<i>ll le faut.</i>
Que devait-elle faire ?
Attendez. Regardez cette porte.
Tu as déjŕ vu cet endroit ?
Je suis déjŕ venu.
Jarod hors du Centre ?
lmpossible.
Comment ?
Secrets et mensonges.
<i>Bonjour, Jarod.</i>
<i>Bonjour, Mme Par</i>k<i>er.</i>
<i>Merci d'ętre venu.</i>
<i>ferme la porte.</i>
Des instruments d'obstétrique ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
Les outils du métier.
Une table d'accouchement ?
Reste ŕ savoir... de qui.
<i>Approche, Jarod.</i>
<i>J'ai quelque chose ŕ te dire.</i>
Ma mčre était enceinte ?
<i>Tu vas avoir un frčre.</i>
C'est vraiment trop bizarre.
Tables d'accouchement,
incubateurs, suivis génétiques...
Tu penses comme moi ?
J'ai un frčre.
J'ai un frčre ?
Jarod et moi
avons un frčre en commun ?
C'est sans doute Ethan.
Mais oů est-il ?
Mes parents sont morts.
Maman est morte, papa est mort.
Je suis ton pčre, maintenant.

<i>j'ai retrouvé ta soeur.</i>
<i>Je sens que Par</i>k<i>er sait,</i>
<i>pour la tombe vide de Catherine.</i>
<i>Ma mère serait toujours en vie ?</i>
<i>- Mirage ?</i>
<i>- ll court toujours.</i>
<i>J'ai presque terminé 76-77.</i>
<i>- ll faut attraper Jarod.</i>
<i>- Donnons-lui</i>
<i>quelque chose</i>
<i>de plus important : Zoe</i>y.
<i>- ll entend des voiX.</i>
<i>- Qui est-ce ?</i>
<i>- Ethan.</i>
<i>- J'ai un frère.</i>
<i>Jarod et moi</i>
<i>avons un frère en commun ?</i>
<i>C'est sans doute Ethan.</i>
<i>Je suis ton père, maintenant.</i>
<i>On m'a enlevé à ma famille.</i>
<i>Au bout de 36 h, il semble déjà</i>
<i>plus doué que les autres.</i>
<i>Combien de gens sont morts</i>
<i>à cause de moi ?</i>
<i>Depuis mon évasion,</i>
<i>je cherche mon passé.</i>
<i>C'est un Caméléon.</i>
<i>Un génie qui peut devenir</i>
<i>qui il veut.</i>
<i>- Le Centre le veut vivant.</i>
<i>- De préférence.</i>
<i>ll défend les opprimés.</i>
<i>La vie est un don.</i>
<i>Vous êtes médecin ?</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, oui.</i>
On manque de détails, Jarod.
Moi-même,
j'essaie d'y voir clair.
J'ai une impression si forte
d'être déjà allé
dans cette maison.
Mais mon esprit
- a tout effacé.
- Moi, j'ai l'impression
que tu mens.
<i>Contente que ton esprit</i>
<i>ne m'ait pas effacée. Dites-lui,</i>
- au cas où il ne saurait pas.
- On a vu le DSA.
Tu y étais indiscutablement.
- Pourquoi je m'en souviens pas ?
<i>- C'est toi, le génie.</i>
- Dis-le-nous.
- S<i>i je pouvais,</i>
<i>je le ferais, tu le sais.</i>
Je ne t'ai rien caché
sur ta mère.
<i>Tu étais sur le D</i>S<i>A.</i>
<i>Elle t'a confié des secrets.</i>
Je ne m'en souviens pas.
Elle t'a dit
pourquoi elle a simulé sa mort ?
Je ne sais pas.
Ou comment ce bébé
pouvait être ton frère ?
Où elle allait,
où le bébé est allé ?
Je ne sais pas !
<i>ll est fort possible</i>
<i>que ton subconscient</i>
ait bloqué ces souvenirs, Jarod.
S<i>oit de lui-même,</i>
<i>soit aidé par quelqu'un.</i>
Ces souvenirs
seraient encore dans sa tête ?
Chaque moment de notre vie
est gravé dans notre esprit.
S<i>i ça peut t'aider, je crois</i>
que notre frère
est un dénommé Ethan.
<i>J'ignore où il est,</i>
mais il est impliqué
dans un projet intitulé 76-77.
<i>Trouve à quoi correspond</i>
<i>76-77, tu trouveras</i>
petit frère.
<i>J'ai presque terminé 76-77.</i>
<i>ll me manque</i>
<i>quelques pièces.</i>
<i>Mais je dois vous parler.</i>
- Toujours rien ?
- Rien.
Me sortez pas
de chez moi comme ça !
J'avais du fromage fondu
sur le feu.
Où je le mets ?
- Allez.
- Faites un voeu...
C'est le petit trafiquant
de munitions.
Jed Cidel.
Un petit intermédiaire.
Une fouine.
ça tombe bien, la chasse
à la fouine vient d'ouvrir.
Agent Curtis, FBl.
Au nom du Bureau, bravo.
T'es promu.
Ah bon ?
Aider un fabricant de bombes
à tuer d'innocents citoyens,
ça change des télés volées.
Tu entres chez les grands.
Tes parents doivent être fiers.
Vous vous trompez.
Vraiment ?
ll a pas l'air de penser ça.
Je sais pas qui c'est.
- C'était pas ma question.
- C'était quoi ?
Pourquoi tu aides
ton ami à faire des bombes ?
Ethan est pas mon ami.
Ethan ?
Tu le connais, alors ?
ll va me tuer, si je parle.
ll cause à des gens
qui sont même pas là.
ll est dingue.
Contrairement
aux prisonniers à perpète.
ll paraît que la douche
est super.
ll cherchait des explosifs.
Semtex C-4, amorces digitales...
Moi, tout ce que j'ai fait,
c'est appeler un type
et fixer un rencard.
Quand et où ?
A l'entrepôt à minuit.
Broad Street et Franklin.
ll ne restait qu'une minute
sur le DSA,
mais ça nous a appris des choses.
<i>Dr Raines, laissez-nous seuls.</i>
<i>Je ne crois pas</i>
<i>que ce soit une bonne idée.</i>
<i>C'est une idée formidable.</i>
<i>Jarod, il</i> y <i>a une chose</i>
<i>que je dois te dire,</i>
<i>que tu ne dois jamais oublier.</i>
<i>Je ne vivrai</i>
<i>peut-être pas longtemps</i>
<i>et je veuX que tu dises</i>
<i>une chose importante à ma fille.</i>
<i>Tu me promets de lui dire ?</i>
<i>Je vous le promets.</i>
<i>C'est quelque chose</i>
<i>que personne ne doit entendre.</i>
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Réparez ça.
Elle a débranché.
C'est tout.
C'est tout, mes fesses !
Faites-le parler.
Je ne peux pas.
Le secret de ma mère,
la seule chose
qu'elle voulait que je sache,
est non seulement perdu
techniquement,
mais également
dans la tête de Jarod.
Raines a dû effacer
cette portion
de l'esprit de Jarod.
Par un lavage de cerveau ?
- Sûrement.
- J'ignore comment Raines
a verrouillé la mémoire du génie,
mais je la libérerai,
même si je dois
lui ouvrir le crâne
avec un couteau à pastèque.
- Comment on fait ?
- On suit Raines.
ll doit savoir où est Ethan.
On trouve Ethan, on trouve Jarod.
Du calme, fils.
Tout va bien se passer.
Je me sens si seul.
Tu n'es pas seul, Ethan.
Je suis là.
Tu le sais, non ?
Quand tu auras gagné la confiance
du Triumvirat avec l'attentat,
tu viendras au Centre.
On fera de grandes choses ensemble.
Je t'appellerai bientôt.
Ethan ? ça va.
Je ne te ferai pas de mal.
C'est vous qui avez tué
mes parents.
Je n'ai pas tué tes parents.
Comment vous savez
que je peux le croire ?
Je ne crois personne.
Ni vous...
ni lui.
Ethan, je suis ton ami.
Ethan, cours !
Ta 9e vie vient de s'écouler.
Tu as l'air étonné d'être ici.
Je suis étonné
d'être encore en vie.
Les morts ne parlent pas.
Puisqu'on est ici,
ça n'a rien à voir avec le Centre ?
C'est personnel.
J'ai besoin de ton aide.
Dis-moi ce que je veux savoir
et tu seras libre.
Pourquoi je croirais
que tu me laisseras filer ?
Regarde ça.
<i>- Bonjour, Mme Par</i>k<i>er.</i>
<i>- Merci d'être venu.</i>
<i>ferme la porte.</i>
<i>Approche.</i>
<i>Je dois te dire quelque chose.</i>
<i>Tu vas avoir un frère.</i>
Je ne m'en souviens pas, Sydney.
C'est dans ton esprit.
Quelque part.
Faisons-le sortir.
Remonte dans ta mémoire.
A quand tu étais enfant.
Tu y es ?
Reviens à un moment
où Raines est venu
pour te faire sortir du Centre.
Où t'a-t-il conduit ?
Une maison dans la forêt.
Tu vois cette maison ?
Entre à l'intérieur.
Tu y es ?
Oui. Je sens une odeur de bois.
De boiseries... de cèdre.
Très bien, Jarod.
J'ouvre une porte coulissante.
- Elle est là.
- Qui ?
Catherine Parker.
Elle est toujours en vie.
Elle n'est pas morte
dans l'ascenseur.
Elle semble inquiète.
Pourquoi ?
Elle me demande
de dire à sa fille
quelque chose de très important.
<i>C'est très important</i>
<i>qu'elle sache la vérité sur Ethan.</i>
<i>C'est lui qui m'a dit son nom.</i>
<i>Je ne comprends pas.</i>
<i>Comment le sait-il ?</i>
<i>Et vous ?</i>
<i>J'appelle ça mon 6e sens.</i>
<i>Pour la plupart des gens,</i>
<i>c'est un frisson dans le cou</i>
<i>ou l'impression</i>
<i>que l'estomac se noue.</i>
<i>Pour moi, ce sont des voiX</i>
<i>que j'entends autour de moi.</i>
<i>Elles m'avertissent</i>
<i>de ce qui va arriver.</i>
<i>Comme des âmes</i>
<i>qui vous parlent ?</i>
<i>Plus ou moins.</i>
<i>J'ai reçu ce don, Jarod</i>
<i>et, bien qu'elle l'ignore,</i>
<i>ma fille aussi.</i>
<i>Mais ni elle ni moi</i>
<i>ne l'avons autant qu'Ethan.</i>
<i>Je prie</i>
<i>pour que ce don</i>
<i>ne soit pas eXploité à tort.</i>
<i>- Pourquoi me dites-vous ça ?</i>
<i>- Ethan est ton frère.</i>
<i>A mon insu,</i>
<i>alors que j'étais sous sédatifs</i>
<i>pour une opération bénigne,</i>
<i>mon mari...</i>
<i>a utilisé la semence de ton père</i>
<i>pour me féconder.</i>
<i>L'ADN de mon père.</i>
<i>M. Par</i>k<i>er voulait créer un enfant</i>
<i>qui ait ce 6e sens</i>
<i>et qui soit aussi intelligent</i>
<i>que toi,</i>
<i>pour l'eXploiter, sans doute,</i>
<i>comme ils t'ont eXploité.</i>
<i>M. Raines m'a montré</i>
<i>la preuve</i>
<i>de tout cela</i>
<i>et du projet de M. Par</i>k<i>er</i>
<i>de me tuer une fois le bébé né.</i>
<i>M. Raines me fait peur.</i>
<i>Vous lui faites confiance ?</i>
<i>Je lui ai fait confiance</i>
<i>car il m'a fait confiance.</i>
<i>Et c'était l'unique mo</i>y<i>en</i>
<i>d'offrir à cet enfant une chance</i>
<i>d'avoir une vraie vie.</i>
<i>Mais... maintenant...</i>
<i>Quelque chose ne va pas ?</i>
<i>Les voiX me disent</i>
<i>que je ne quitterai pas</i>
<i>cette maison vivante.</i>
<i>Vous m'avez fait venir pour ça.</i>
<i>Tu es intelligent.</i>
<i>Je sais que tu n'oublieras pas.</i>
<i>Je veuX que tu dises</i>
<i>à ma fille</i>
<i>d'achever mon projet.</i>
<i>Elle comprendra un jour.</i>
<i>Dis-lui d'écouter son 6e sens.</i>
<i>ll guidera ses actes.</i>
<i>Jarod, tu as une âme</i>
<i>pleine de confiance,</i>
<i>comme ta mère.</i>
<i>Vous connaissez ma mère ?</i>
<i>Un jour, vous serez réunis.</i>
<i>Ethan t'aidera à la retrouver.</i>
<i>Ecoute...</i>
ton 6e sens.
- Des nouvelles de Cox pour Zoey ?
- ll est prêt.
Je suis venu pour ça.
Les gens du Triumvirat voulaient
que vous voyiez ceci.
Raines n'a pas chômé.
<i>J'ai intercepté une note</i>
<i>de Raines au Triumvirat</i>
<i>et je ne suis sûrement</i>
<i>pas le seul.</i>
Crachez le morceau.
ll s'agit de 76-77
et de ce truc, Mirage.
Ce ''truc'' est mon frère.
En gros, il y a un projet
intitulé 76-77
et s'il suit son cours, M. Raines
dirigera le Centre.
Un coup d'éclat de Raines.
J'ai l'impression que tu sais
ce que Broots m'a dit.
Raines a préparé ça
toute sa sordide carrière.
Avec Ethan.
ll l'a enlevé enfant,
l'a placé
chez des parents adoptifs,
des gens qui laisseraient Raines
contrôler ses émotions.
ll l'a bousillé
au point qu'il ne se fie
qu'à Raines.
Pour que Raines
en ait le contrôle absolu,
qu'il fasse d'Ethan
son assassin privé.
Et quand Raines a tué
ses parents adoptifs,
il a coupé tout lien affectif
avec le monde extérieur.
C'est la spécialité de Raines.
Enlever les gens
à leur famille.
Tu vas faire quoi ?
J'en sais rien.
Fais ce qu'aurait voulu ta mère.
Achève son oeuvre.
L'oeuvre qui lui a coûté la vie.
Ma mère est peut-être
toujours en vie.
Et si elle ne l'est pas ?
Tu peux arrêter Raines.
Je ne sais pas !
Ecoute ton sixième sens.
Moi, je l'écoute.
Je vais retrouver mon...
notre frère.
Je vous ai déjà dit
à quel point était inspiré
votre numéro
de saint à roulettes ?
De quoi vous parlez ?
Vous êtes pas plus
ressuscité que moi.
Mais bon,
après votre fiasco de l'an dernier,
ça vous a sauvé la vie.
Pas de honte à cela.
Mais quand on est le chouchou
du Triumvirat, pas besoin de Dieu.
ça n'a pas de sens.
Mais si !
Comme cette note adressée
au Triumvirat.
Vous êtes bien
avec nos chefs africains.
76-77 et Mirage.
Votre coup d'éclat.
ça ne vous dit rien ?
- D'où tenez-vous ça ?
- Si vous pouvez trouver Dieu,
moi, je peux trouver ça.
Que voulez-vous ?
Je veux diriger le Centre.
Avec vous.
L'attentat 76-77 a lieu,
Mirage, ou plutôt Ethan,
vient au Centre
comme promis au Triumvirat.
Et tout ça parce que je décide
de ne pas dire à M. Parker
que vous lui avez volé son fils.
Que vous lui avez volé
son trophée, Mirage.
Si j'ai bien lu le communiqué,
il est temps pour vous
d'activer Ethan
et de mener à bien 76-77.
Alors, associé ?
<i>76-77 est lancé.</i>
<i>C'est ton dernier appel.</i>
<i>Après, c'est à toi de jouer.</i>
<i>Parcours 3 blocs</i>
<i>jusqu'à la gare routière,</i>
<i>ouvre la consigne nl9</i>
<i>et tu trouveras les dernières</i>
<i>instructions pour l'attentat.</i>
<i>Où sont mon père et ma mère ?</i>
On ne pourrait pas l'arrêter,
mais si on le voulait.
Content ?
Un peu !
- Fils de...
- Allons...
C'est ainsi que vous traitez
votre nouvel associé ?
Nouveau patron.
On a localisé l'appel.
On surveille Ethan jusqu'à
la fin de 76-77
et on le ramène.
- Pas de fiasco.
- Enfermez-le
au niveau souterrain 25,
avec les rats.
Après toutes ces années,
finir comme ça...
Je ne suis pas fini, moi.
Je peux vous aider ?
En fait, oui.
- Comment te sens-tu ?
- Mieux.
On a du temps à rattraper.
Je vais retrouver maman.
Et on sera tous réunis
en une grande famille.
Et Ethan ?
Papa m'a tout raconté.
ll n'est pas fou.
Pas comme tu le pensais.
Notre frère...
ll a un don.
ll n'est pas comme les autres.
Ne les laisse pas briser Ethan
comme ils ont brisé notre famille.
D'accord,
je te le promets.
Fais de beaux rêves.
Quelqu'un est mort ?
J'ai reconstitué
une autre partie des DSA.
Et ?
Asseyez-vous.
<i>Je vois sa tête.</i>
<i>- C'est un...</i>
<i>- Un garçon.</i>
<i>Vous avez raison.</i>
<i>Un garçon.</i>
<i>Bonjour, je suis ta mère.</i>
<i>J'ai de grands projets pour toi.</i>
Vous ne vouliez pas
que je voie ça ?
Ce n'est pas fini.
<i>Après ma tâche,</i>
<i>je voulais t'élever,</i>
<i>avec ton frère et ta soeur,</i>
<i>comme une vraie famille.</i>
<i>Mais je ne pourrai pas,</i>
<i>petit bonhomme.</i>
<i>J'ai compris</i>
<i>que je ne pourrais pas</i>
<i>te voir grandir.</i>
<i>Mais tu as un frère</i>
<i>et une soeur</i>
<i>qui te retrouveront</i>
<i>et te protégeront.</i>
<i>Dis-leur de finir mon oeuvre,</i>
<i>de finir mon projet.</i>
<i>Je t'aime.</i>
- Vous ne devriez pas...
- J'ai besoin
de savoir.
<i>Je regrette.</i>
<i>Je ne fais qu'obéir auX ordres.</i>
<i>Vous m'aviez convaincue</i>
<i>que vous aviez changé,</i>
<i>que vous teniez à ce bébé.</i>
<i>ll n'</i>y <i>a pas d'autre mo</i>y<i>en.</i>
Raines l'a exécutée.
<i>- faites-la incinérer.</i>
<i>- Bien, docteur.</i>
<i>Je suis ta maman, maintenant.</i>
Raines a exécuté ma mère.
ll ne me prendra pas mon frère.
Syd, parlez-lui.
ll n'y a plus rien à dire.
Tu as trouvé
l'ordinateur d'Ethan ?
A l'entrepôt
où il a pris les pièces.
J'ai reconstruit le disque dur
et trouvé le schéma
de l'attentat.
Mieux encore :
je sais où il aura lieu.
76-77 ?
C'est un métro.
A Washington.
Le métro n'est pas sa cible.
C'est son système de livraison.
Le métro 76-77 a pour terminus
Freedom Station.
Juste au-dessous
du National Hotel.
Où des centaines de dignitaires
sont réunis pour parler de la paix.
Adieu, la paix.
J'ai décrypté son mot de passe.
Ethan activera la bombe
de son portable.
Le métro quitte la station
dans une heure.
On a juste le temps
de sauver Ethan.
<i>Navré d'appeler si tard,</i>
<i>mais j'ai pensé</i>
<i>que tu aimerais</i>
<i>sauver la vie</i>
<i>d'une amie proche.</i>
<i>- Relâche-la !</i>
- C'est exactement
ce que je voulais faire,
mais M. Cox veut exploiter
ta petite amie
<i>à son avantage.</i>
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
<i>Vous proposer un échange.</i>
<i>fais pas ça, Jarod !</i>
<i>Je sais pas ce qu'ils te veulent,</i>
<i>mais ils vont te tuer,</i>
<i>je le sais !</i>
S<i>i vous voulez Zoe</i>y <i>vivante,</i>
<i>rendez-vous ce soir</i>
<i>à Rosing's farm,</i>
<i>Highwa</i>y <i>1 2,</i>
<i>à côté de Blue Cove,</i>
<i>dans eXactement une heure.</i>
Dans une heure !
Exactement quand Ethan
sera dans le métro !
Du fond du coeur, Mlle Parker...
Mon 1 er souvenir de vous,
c'était dans le hall du Centre.
Vous fumiez une cigarette.
J'avais six ou sept ans
et vous,
vous vous êtes accroupi,
avez tiré une bouffée
et m'avez soufflé
la fumée au visage.
Et vous voilà...
toujours à souffler de la fumée.
Si ça peut servir, Mlle Parker...
Je ne reverrai jamais ma mère.
Mais je compte bien
sauver mon frère.
Dites-moi
tout ce que vous savez
sur 76-77
et je vous laisserai peut-être
vivre un jour de plus.
Je suis votre dernière chance,
Raines.
76-77 est un métro
de Washington
qui part de Beacon Station
dans un peu plus d'une heure.
Et après ?
En arrivant à Freedom Station,
le métro et l'immeuble au-dessus
exploseront.
Votre frère posera la bombe
et conduira le métro.
- Notre Père...
- Pas si vite.
Avant de mourir,
ma mère a parlé
d'une ''tâche inachevée'',
d'un ''projet''.
Que voulait-elle dire ?
Vous n'avez jamais trouvé ?
Trouvé quoi ?
Votre mère aurait laissé un DSA
expliquant son projet.
Mais c'est la seule preuve
que je n'ai ni trouvée
ni détruite.
Trouvez-la
et vous connaîtrez son projet.
Vous devez en savoir plus.
C'est à propos de tout.
A propos du Centre,
des mensonges.
N'oubliez pas,
même si votre mère
a laissé des réponses,
il reste
une personne vivante
qui sait toute la vérité.
Qui ?
Je ne voulais pas que ma fille
ait du sang sur les mains.
C'est le sang
qui t'inquiétait...
ou la vérité ?
Jarod devrait arriver dans 20 mn.
A vos postes
et tenez-vous prêts.
Vous êtes sûr qu'il viendra ?
ll viendra.
Zoey, on n'aurait pas
réussi sans vous.
Allez vous faire voir.
En amour comme à la guerre.
Dommage,
vous n'êtes pas asiatique.
Quand ce sera fini,
on vous enverra
en renouvellement.
Laissez Jarod tranquille.
ll nous appartient.
- Ce n'est pas Jarod !
- Major Charles !
<i>- C'est moi, Zoe</i>y.
- Tu vas bien.
<i>Oui, tout va bien</i>
<i>de notre côté.</i>
Mais je me demande
qui sont Cox
<i>- et L</i>y<i>le.</i>
- Désolé de t'avoir mêlée à ça.
Sois prudent, Jarod.
Promis.
<i>Pilotage automatique</i>
Reculez !
Je ne te veux pas de mal.
- Elles me disent de me méfier.
- C'est pas vrai.
- Pas toutes.
- J'aimerais ne pas les entendre.
C'est ton 6e sens.
Ce qui te rend unique.
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Je suis ton frère.
Elle m'a parlé de toi.
Bien sûr,
une des voix.
C'est elle que tu dois écouter.
Qui est-elle ?
Ta mère.
Tu ne l'as pas connue,
on t'a interdit
de la connaître,
mais c'est ta mère.
Elle est ton guide.
Ecoute sa voix.
C'est ton 6e sens.
M. Raines est mon guide.
ll a exploité tes dons contre toi,
t'a appris à craindre
ces voix
au lieu de les écouter.
ll t'a exploité.
ll t'exploite encore.
Ne le laisse pas
exploiter ton don pour détruire.
Je dois suivre ses ordres.
Si tu le fais,
des innocents mourront.
Ce n'est pas toi.
Tu n'es pas comme ça.
Ecoute-la.
Concentre-toi sur sa voix.
<i>fais-lui confiance, mon fils.</i>
C'est Jarod.
Ecoute-la.
Mon frère ?
Tu peux t'affranchir de lui.
Ecoute sa voix.
Tu as une famille.
Une vraie.
On sera toujours là.
Dis-moi où est la bombe.
Tu peux pas arrêter le train
ni désamorcer la bombe.
J'ai appartenu à 3 équipes
de déminage. Je peux.
La bombe est sous le train.
On peut pas s'arrêter.
ll faut dévier le train.
Où est Freedom Station ?
- La voie de droite.
- Et celle de gauche ?
Elle conduit
à un dépôt abandonné.
- Attends.
- ça sert à rien.
Je l'ai programmé
pour tourner à droite.
J'ai aussi construit
des fusées.
3 000 mètres,
2 900...
2 800. Vas-y !
C'est bon.
Le train freine
dans 40 secondes.
La bombe explose
Faut sortir de là !
Pas un geste !
Ecoute-moi.
- ll y a une bombe.
- Je sais !
- On a moins de 60 secondes.
- Désamorce-la !
lmpossible,
elle est sous le train.
Arrête le train !
Trop tard.
Avec de la chance,
on pourra sauter, mais je peux pas
arrêter l'explosion.
C'est ton frère.
Notre frère.
ça pourrait être un début.
N'en fais pas une fin.
<i>Je suis ta mère. Je t'aime.</i>
C'est sa voix.
C'est la voix de ta mère
qu'il entend, Parker.
Tu l'entends peut-être aussi.
Ecoute cette voix.
Le train freine.
Plus que 20 secondes.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
- L'effet Raines.
Tu décides quoi ?
Aide-moi à le sauver,
à sauver notre famille.
A toi de voir.
Accroche-toi à moi.
- Et maintenant ?
- On saute !
Maintenant !

NlCE FELLOW
[Man]
Previously on The Pretender.
You people only understand one thing- power.
- Daddy, get back!
- Shoot him!
Welcome back to the Centre, Jarod.
Settle down or I'll bash you again!
[Sniffs, Sighs]
He still stinks,
On the way to the shower, he freaked.
Thought he was gonna chew my heart out.
It took a little swipe
from the motivator to calm him down,
[Grunts]
If you don't want to go to the showers,
I'll bring the showers to you.
[Spits]
[Grunting]
Enough!
We don't want him dead,
just less odiferous,
Clean the filth off yourself,
then do the walls.
- You clean it.
- [Chuckling]
The world is changing.
Mr, Parker is gone,
Mr, Raines is gone,
Miss Parker is...
God only knows where.
But you and I are here...
and I'm in charge.
[Crackling]
[Gasping]
Like I said, the world's changing.
No! No! No! You bastards!
No! No! No!
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us,
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family,
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others,
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be,
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
[Miss Parker]
He defends the weak and abused,
[Jarod]
Life's a gift,
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
No! No! You bastards!
That was three weeks ago, Since then we've
been working on making him more manageable,
Why haven't I been allowed to see him?
- Look at him, He was out of control,
- Was?
The world is changing,
and so is Boy Wonder.
[Screaming]
Listen to me, Lyle.
You're a sick man.
I'm a persuasive man.
Jarod? I have a project
that I'd like you to do for me,
Anything you want, Mr. Lyle.
[Sydney]
Brainwashing's not possible with Jarod,
Oh, we all have an Achilles' heel.
In Jarod's case, it's family.
The one he so desperately
wants back,
If you wanna hear about
Mommy and Daddy, just trust me.
[Jarod Crying]
- I love that part.
- Lyle, please let me go to him.
Sydney, if it were up to me, you two
could go on a father-son picnic...
but the isolation orders come from
the Triumvirate - Big Mutumbo,
I got here as quickly as I could.
Sydney, if you'll excuse me.
We haven't finished talking about Jarod!
Jarod is no longer the most important thing
in the world, and tomorrow he leaves forever.
He's Mutumbo's property, and I, for one,
am not gonna cross that crazy Zulu.
Did you see the look on his face
when he took Raines and my father away?
Just, uh, take in a movie.
Get a massage,
Check out the amputee dwarves
down in SL 6.
Just forget about Jarod.
[Broots]
Yous tole a D.S.A. from Lyle?
Ever since Mutumbo's put
that thumbless maniac in charge...
more bodies have been droppin' around here
than St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
Did he tell you where
Miss Parker's hospitalized?
- No, He played dumb on that too,
- Who's the albino?
Someone more important than Jarod.
[Broots]
Who could be more important than Jarod?
I don't know. Maybe the world
really is changing.
[Man Screaming]
[Man]
Stop the voices!
Nurse, uh, I'm looking for my daughter.
At the end of the hall.
Oh! Oh, my! Oh, my angel!
- [Grunts]
- Daddy?
Where-
Oh! Oh, thank you, Lord.
- My angel, I am so sorry.
- [Monitor Beeping]
- It wasn't your fault.
- It is all my fault.
- Are you okay?
- They kept me drugged in I.C.U.
for three weeks.
You're the first visitor I've seen.
Yeah. I noticed.
Yeah, it's a damn good thing, angel, huh?
Those bastards don't know where I am.
They don't know I'm here,
and we're gonna keep it that way.
- Where have you been?
- Equatorial Africa.
The Triumvirate must be happy
they got Jarod back.
Oh, yeah, you'd think so.
Instead, they threw
one right nasty soiree...
for me and that wheezing bastard Raines.
- I'm beginning to wonder about his loyalty.
- Beginning to-
The bullet in my back was meant for you.
[Chuckling]
Can't kill a Parker. Never.
I got Brigitte out already.
Gotta keep that baby.
Gotta have that baby, especially alive.
Daddy, what the hell's going on?
Same as usual-Jarod.
He's the key to our survival- all of us.
- Oh, can't talk. Not here. Not now.
- You're scaring me.
Oh, we can't have that. I mean,
that's what they want. Can't have that.
Can't give them the edge.
- [Clears Throat]
- She's not supposed to have visitors.
- I was just leaving.
- Me too. I'm discharging myself.
- Only your psychiatrist can discharge you.
- The psychiatrist?
I was shot!
Since when do headshrinkers
use scalpels?
[Man]
I want my mommy!
Oh, she probably went to call somebody.
I hope I can trust you
not to tell anybody I was here.
Daddy, don't leave me.
I'll come back when I can explain. Huh?
Oh, who was that, uh, playwright
with the white beard?
Your mother used to read him
all the time-with all that punctuation.
- Shaw?
- Yeah, well, whatever.
Listen, there's a quote
I want you to remember.
"A family is a tyranny...
ruled over by its weakest member,"
Its weakest member.
Don't forget that.
Oh, Daddy.
Daddy, Daddy,
# Kri kra toad's foot #
# Geese walk barefoot #
So what's in store tonight?
Another date with Mr. Lyle's jumper cable?
Different game this time, Jarod,
- Are we taking another trip?
- This time it's not so dependable,
Vaccines.
Hepatitis "A," malaria, typhoid.
- Africa.
- You are as smart as they say.
- Lot of good it's done me lately.
- Arm.
[Grunts]
# Kri kra toad's foot #
[Sydney]
Tell me where Jarod is, Angelo,
Find him for me,
Hey. What's goin' on?
I'm using Angelo's empathetic abilities to try
and determine where Jarod is being kept.
How does the, uh, freak
with the Flowbee fit in?
In case of suspicions, I wanted
the lab to be business as usual,
Ah. Usual.
- Sydney. Scared.
- Yes, Angelo.
Sydney is scared
that he'll never see Jarod again.
Empath Jarod. Tell me where
they're holding him,
- [Broots] Any luck?
- Not yet. You?
I found some bread crumbs
that may lead us to Miss Parker.
A short call comes in at the exact same time
from a hospital 50 miles west of here,
- Patient update.
- Exactly,
Before I could track where the calls went to,
Lyle's albino came blustering in.
Something about
a priority communication,
Something called Si- Silence.
Silence, huh?
[Angelo]
Angelo happy. Find Jarod.
If you wanna hear about
Mommy and Daddy, just trust me.
[Whispering]
Jarod. Jarod.
- Sydney.
- Are you okay?
Is it true?
- Is it true that they captured
my father and the boy?
- Did Lyle tell you that?
He said only one of them survived,
and I'd find out which one in Africa...
if I cooperate.
- You trust Lyle?
- Don't you?
[Door Opens]
Well, don't you, Sydney?
I see even you found this needle
in our little haystack,
I wonder how.
I never liked you.
I 'm not even sure
what the hell you are.
Come on, Jarod. Time to go.
No injections this time, Jarod.
- [Pills Rattling]
- Sedatives.
- Jarod.
- It's okay, Sydney.
- I prefer to sleep through this.
- Jarod, don't!
Lyle, I won't allow this!
Deny it as sweet sorrow
if you want, Sydney...
but you two are parting,
so be a man.
Say adios.
Good-bye, Sydney.
Tongue? That-a-boy.
Uh, Sydney? Put him away.
Jarod's soul is clouded,
His mind is still sharp.
Good night, sweet prince,
We're good to go.
The tower called, We have a priority
passenger to be dropped off,
Level "A" project called Silence.
Until we cross the Atlantic,
we're not stoppin' anywhere for anyone.
[Man]
Mr, Lyle says we are,
I'll tell you where we're going
when we get in the air.
Yes, Mr, Lyle, I have the blueprints
and everything I need,
Tell our clients at Raylor that as soon
as our inside person gets the E.T.A...
Silence will go down flawlessly this time.
Well, the C-4 will catalyze the on-site
accelerant and burn white hot,
Even if someone could dig
through the debris...
our corporate customers
can rest assured...
there'll be no trace of even
the timing device that survives.
Oh, I guarantee you- there'll be
no trace left of the Nash family...
or anyone else
who happens to be in that building.
Any residual fallout will just help to mask
the I.D.'s of our intended targets,
I'll contact you when I'm in place.
- Haven't you people destroyed enough lives?
- What the hell's goin' on?
If a bullet penetrates the jet's skin,
it can explode,
Not if something plugs the hole.
[Alarm Beeping]
Come on! Come on!
- [Gasps]
- Good morning, sweet prince.
Fortunately, I was able to land
the plane in almost one piece,
My lucky day.
Where's Mr. White?
He disappeared. Any idea where
he might have disappeared to?
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
[Lyle] Yes, Mutumbo, I understand clearly
every word that you are saying...
and I assure you that the irony
of Jarod's escape is not lost on me either.
[Mutumbo On Phone]
Sir, are you being facetious?
Facetious? No. No.
Of course I'm not being facetious, sir.
[Mutumbo]
You understand?
Yes, I understand the importance of
reacquiring Jarod as it relates
to Silence, sir...
but, as you know,
we have an inside person,
So, our friends at Raylor can rest assured
that the project will not be compromised.
- [Mutumbo] It better not be.
- Yes, sir, You have my word,
- All right.
- It seems like the world
hasn't changed so much.
Okay, Sydney,
you were right, and I was wrong.
But I would rather be alive and wrong
than dead right.
And if we don't get Jarod back...
I'm not the only one Mutumbo's
gonna personally reeducate.
- Oh. Oh, sorry for bursting in.
- What?
You won't believe who I just saw
walkin' around the hallways alive as day.
I mean, rumor has it he's supposed
to be dead, but he's, uh, not.
[Wheezing]
Glad to disappoint you.
Huh.
[Gasps]
It's good to be back
in the bosom of the Centre.
God bless you all!
Now, let's go catch Jarod.
Amen.
A Ph.D. in nuclearphysics from M.I.T. and a
doctorate in radio isotopic design from USC,
That's a pretty impressive sheepskin.
You see what they look like on the Internet,
press print, and you're somebody else.
Oh, uh, Jeanie,
this is Dr. Jarod Hickum.
Helped design the propulsion system
on the Cassini probe for NASA.
- Nice to meet you.
- Weren't those Russian-made reactors?
I believe that you're thinking
of the TOPAZ II.
The Cassini's reactors were Chandon designed,
with 72 pounds of 238 at the core.
Well, I hope your expertise can help us
with the Neptune probe.
We're, um, three months
behind schedule.
And we've lost our two
best researchers.
[Jarod]
Well, I'm here to do everything I can,
[Monitor Beeping]
Sydney,
Miss Parker.
Miss Parker, we've been searching
everywhere for you.
- Thank God you're-
- Alive? Hardly.
And these morons in here
won't let me out,
Oh, I get my strength back,
I swear I'm going postal.
That's what they're afraid of.
According to this chart,
you were admitted under a suicide watch.
Suicide? I was shot in the back!
- Only your next of kin can okay your discharge.
- Next of kin.
Parker, have you heard
from your father?
- No.
- Well, somebody sure wants
to keep you in here.
- Yeah, the wheezing sack of bones Raines.
- I'm not certain that's right.
Raines may have spent some time
on Mutumbo's side of the street...
but he's acting more like he's been
in Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.
- He found religion- or it was given to him.
- I don't buy it.
There's somethin' goin' down at the Centre,
and they don't want me around.
Lyle keeps saying, "The world is changing."
Besides Raines's rebirth, Jarod has escaped.
Lyle has some albino running
a priority project called Silence,
I gotta get outta here.
[Groans]
You still need rest.
At least another 24 hours.
Twenty-four hours, and then
I'm blowin' this CAT scan stand.
I want you to find out everything you can
about the albino and Silence.
They may have me down,
but I'll be damned if I'm out. Go!
[Chattering]
- Jarod, What are you doing here?
- Jeanie. Hi.
I was trying to get a leg up on things and I
thought I would go straight to the source.
What part of the project
were the Nashes working on?
They were heading up the research
for Raylor Corporation's propulsion system.
They made some incredible discoveries
with multiple applications,
But most of their work
was sealed after the accident.
- Accident?
- Yeah, a freak thing.
Their sailboat blew up while in port
in the Caribbean. A gas leak or something.
- I can't believe they're dead.
- Maybe they're not.
Who sealed the data?
The word was it all went to
the Department of Energy office in Albany.
- [Phone Ringing]
- This is Sydney,
I hear silence is golden,
especially at the Centre,
There is a project called Silence,
but God only knows what it is.
- Is that Mr. Broots I hear?
- Yeah. How'd you know?
Deviated septum. Right nostril.
Well, I did get beaned with
an Etch A Sketch when I was seven-
What can you tell me about Silence?
Just that Lyle and some weird-looking
albino guy were talkin' about it.
[Jarod]
Ah, yes, The white-haired man,
He and I shared
some frequent-flyermiles,
I can't talk to you about this. We're-
We're supposed to be tryin' to catch you.
I know where you live, Mr. Broots.
Even if we did find something out
about Silence-
You don't know
what's going on around here.
I mean, they turned Mr. Raines
into Pat Robertson.
Silence is about the Centre killing
a man, woman and their child,
Now, Lyle and the albino have
an inside person helping them,
My guess is someone
within the Department of Energy,
- I need help finding out who.
- We'll do our best.
Well, you'd better,
because if you don't...
an innocent family is going to die.
[Beeps]
[Siren Blaring]
So, who's this new hot shot
joining the Nash detail, Inspector?
His name is Jarod Watts,
but he is hardly a hotshot.
Bottom third in college,
barely squeak-by I.Q
This guy has been bounced around from
one mediocre assignment to the next,
- But he has one thing
on his resume that none of us have.
- [Woman] What's that?
- The same last name as the undersecretary.
- Son?
- Nephew.
- Oh.
I'm sorry I'm, uh, late.
So-
Sorry. Uh, Jarod Watts.
The reason I'm late is I was doing
a little boning up on that Nash thing,
The "Nash thing" is a P-1
Witness Protection transfer, Watts,
- Please don't forget that.
- Uh, yes, sir.
- Now then-
- [Loud Clattering]
Agent Timson will continue to be point
on the Clare Nash protection team...
up until she is reunited
with husband and daughter.
I'll be maintaining a Code 3
security status on the Nash woman.
Excuse me,
Uh, isn't a Code 3 a little bit thin?
That's the idea, Watts,
You see, a Code 3 provides protection
without drawing undue attention...
to the location
said witness is being held,
- It's really quite effective.
- Yes, sir. Code 3.
[Chuckling]
Agent Carlson.
Please, try to bring Watts up
to speed on the "Nash thing,"
I'll tolerate no mistakes,
That's lunch.
Angel, it's Daddy. I looked for you
at the hospital, but you're gone.
You can't keep a Parker underwraps.
No, sirree.
Uh, what I need to tell you
has to be said face-to-face,
I'll be at your place tonight at 9:00,
Now, you be alone, Erase this tape,
I wouldn't want
the wrong people showin'up,
Wrong people. Raines.
[Carlson] The Nashes'nuclear research
for the Raylor Corporation...
was supposed to be strictly
for space propulsion applications.
But when they suspected Raylor was sellin'
their work for weapons applications...
they decided to blow the whistle
to the D.O.E.
- That's when someone
tried to kill them on the boat.
- Are there any leads?
None. Completely professional job.
- It turned out to be almost
as good as killing them.
- How's that?
Well, the Nashes got separated in the mayhem,
and it drove them underground.
Until the D.O.E. found Jason Nash
and his daughter living in the Caribbean.
They were placed in protective custody,
Jason Nash said he'd testify if his wife was
found and they were reunited as a family.
We just recently found Clare,
Tomorrow at 3:00 we bring them all back
together at the Atomic Research Lab.
Family reunited, family talks.
Family talks, family dies.
My work here is my life, I've spent years
here doing the work of the Lord,
Raines, it's time for you
to pay for killing my mother,
Say your prayers, you son of a bitch.
Miss Parker, I'd like to introduce
Father Connelley.
- He was a friend of your mother's,
- How do you do?
I look forward to you continuing
with your good work, Mr. Raines.
What's your good work?
Free exorcisms for the whack jobs
in Renewal?
Do you believe in miracles, Miss Parker?
I believe in revenge.
Now tell me,
why did you try and kill Daddy?
A selfish, misguided act.
But it came from above,
as God is my witness.
This kindness crap
may slay 'em at the parish potluck...
but it ain't cuttin' it with me.
Then I'll turn the other cheek.
Miss Parker,
those miracles I mentioned-
they begin with... love.
When I find out what you're up to...
it's gonna take a hell of a lot more
than a prayer to save your sorry ass.
Thank you, but I'm not hungry,
Mrs. Nash won't eat?
- She's a little freaked out,
- Let me try.
I know it's not gourmet,
but you really should eat.
- It will help you keep your strength up.
- No.
- Thank you though,
- I understand.
When I was a kid...
in the place I grew up in,
I never wanted to eat either.
Why was that, Agent Watts?
Because it wasn't my body
that needed nourishing.
It was my heart.
There wasn't a meal satisfying enough
or a room safe enough...
to help me stop missing the family
that I wanted to be with so badly.
Well, where's your family now?
I don't know.
It's the not knowing, the waiting,
that's the hardest part,
But while you wait,
maybe this can help,
C-Courtney gave me this
for Mother's Day.
I thought I lost it forever.
Tomorrow you'll be back together
with the real thing.
I promise you.
I miss the days
when the people I couldn't trust...
were the people I couldn't trust.
You've obviously met
the new Mr. Raines, Miss Parker.
Now meet Mr. White.
He reports to Lyle.
Since when does anybody
report to my brother?
Since the Triumvirate gave him
his own covert team a few years ago.
His latest project is called Silence.
It's a corporate-sponsored Centre hit
on a couple research scientists.
Jarod was on that plane with White
when it went down.
He knows those innocent people will die
if he doesn't stop him. You know he'll try.
- If Jarod's going, then so am I.
- Hmm.
Miss Parker's gonna want to off herself
when she hears this one,
- Can anybody spare a noose?
- Miss Parker!
- Is your nose whistling?
- I have a deviated septum.
You know, Mr. Parker couldn't
have been the next ofkin...
to have you committed in that hospital
on that suicide watch.
The dates don't square, Mutumbo
had already siphoned away Mr, Parker,
So, the next of kin
would had to have been-
Lyle. Lyle trapped me there.
Daddy?
Daddy!
I'm sorry I can't be there to talk to you
face-to-face, but, uh, plans change, huh?
After all, it is the Centre, right?
Now, I don't have a whole hell
of a lot of time, so pay attention.
The world is changing.
The Centre is changing.
I am changing.
And you? You have to ride
all this crazy stuff out, see?
Just, uh, ride her out.
Don't try to find us.
And above all else, angel,
watch out for yourself.
Don't forget-
"A family is a tyranny"-
"Ruled over by its weakest member."
Thank God you're safe.
You had me worried.
About what? That suicidal sis might
play a little game of razor roulette?
The suicide watch was
for your own protection.
- Oh.
- Not perfect, but it was all I could think of.
The more the others thought you were
a non factor, the safer you'd be.
- Others?
- The same ones that got to Raines...
that put the scare into our father.
Which conveniently put you in charge.
Mutumbo snaps, I jump. Guilty.
You and your team-
I know all about your covert division.
Mr. White. Silence.
Good, because I need your help.
Look, I'm being straight here.
Silence is a Level "A" contract.
The last thing I needed was for Jarod
to escape and make this his cause.
Careful. You're sweating.
Well, with Jarod hovering,
I'd be stupid not to.
You botch a Level "A,"
and you'll need my prayers, not my help.
I need my sister.
I've always been a survivor, Parker...
but in the past year
since I found my father and you...
I- I've realized it's not just me
against the world.
I hear the world's changing.
One look into Dad's eyes confirms it.
Despite that, the Centre's
always been about Parkers,
And like it or not, you and I are it.
Let's fight for it, for us-
for him.
[Chiming]
Timson,
Timson!
- [Grunts]
- Where is she? Where's Clare now?
Jarod! Gone. She's been taken out
to go meet her husband and daughter.
- You weren't told about the schedule change?
- No, I wasn't.
Out of the blue, the transfer orders
were moved up to noon.
- Timson.
- Yeah. They were his orders.
When I asked for details,
he said it was "need to know only."
Guess Timson doesn't think
you and I need to.
Glad to see you've decided
to take up the fight.
I didn't come to help you.
I came to recapture Jarod.
[Beeping]
- It won't be long now, Mrs. Nash.
- Thank you.
[Man On Radio]
Agent Blaine,
- We're in position.
- Roger that,
- Sir, "B" Team has Mr. Nash
and their little girl in position.
- Very good.
[Door Opens]
Well, this is an honor.
Murderers have no honor.
No, no, no. Meeting you.
I mean, my God, you're Jarod.
Didn't have much chance
to talk on the plane,
By the way, I owe you
for some great, great flying.
- Thought I was toast,
- Where's the bomb?
You know where the bomb is,
otherwise you wouldn't be here.
Now, that said, I'm leaving,
- I don't live, I don't get paid.
- You're not going anywhere.
Was it good seeing your dad again?
I mean, you just beat me to him.
But, hey, he's now out there again...
and it kind of keeps me in business,
you know what I mean?
Business?
I'm a finder. Missing families
are kind of my niche.
And yours is a full-time job, brother.
What are you getting at?
Well, just that occasionally Mr. Lyle...
will, uh, pay me for special projects,
Take your sister, Emily, for example,
What do you know about my sister?
That she adores yellow tulips,
she hates cruelty to animals...
she's smart, she's funny...
she's tortured
by the tragedies of her family,,,
and that she has the cutest
little tattoo just above her-
Uh-uh-uh!
Her last known address is in here.
There might even be some tidbits
about dear old Mom too,
Shame to see it all go poof,
There may be time for you
to save that family upstairs...
maybe even time for you
to save this family in here.
But you do not get me in the package.
I'll see you on down the road,
No, No!
[Grunts]
We'll have a better chance
of catching Jarod if we split up,
You three take the interior,
and I'll cover outside.
Fine.
Can I see my husband
and daughter now?
Soon. Very soon, ma'am.
Very soon, ma'am.
- [Rings]
- Oh, excuse me. This is Timson.
Yes, sir, Absolutely, sir,
If I'm not back in, uh, five minutes...
go ahead and bring in
Nash and the girl.
- It won't be long now, ma'am.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
- Oh, there you are.
What the hell are you doing here?
I just came from
Inspector Wocheck's office.
He suspects there's a contract out
on Mrs. Nash's life...
and they think the hitter
might be within the D.O.E.
Ah. Uh, Blaine,
you and Jarod here keep watch.
I'm going out to the mobile unit
to contact the inspector,
- I can save you that trip, sir.
- No, I gotta go.
I nspector Wocheck is gonna call me
on this cell phone at 12:00 sharp.
- That's only a few minutes away.
- I have to review the placement
of my agent perimeters.
- You can use my walkie, sir,
- I don't want to use your damn walkie!
Speak when you're spoken to, Agent,
Excuse me,
Is there something the matter?
- No.
- You seem like you're
in a hurry to get somewhere.
- What the hell's wrong with this thing?
- Nothing.
It's just, uh-
Well, it's, uh-it's locked,
- Open it.
- What's the rush?
Open the damn door! Now!
I-I don't understand. I-
What's the problem?
The problem is, if you don't open the door,
we're gonna blow up, you idiot!
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, you mean this thing I found is a bomb?
- [Beeping]
- Do something!
- Kaboom!
- [Screams]
I find it interesting that you knew
there was a bomb in the building...
but you didn't bother to tell anybody.
You were going to allow
an innocent family to die-
and your own men- in an explosion.
And for what?
Agent Blaine?
Get him out of here.
It would be my pleasure, Jarod.
I think you're here
to see some special people.
Yeah.
[Gasps]
Oh, my baby!
[Jarod]
There's a brown sedan in the parking lot,
Here's all the information you need
to start your new life.
You'll be safe. I promise you.
- But- But who are you?
- No, it's all right. We can trust him.
Oh, Jarod, I hope that one day you
and your family can feel this moment too.
[Kisses, Chuckles]
- Good luck.
- Bye.
- Parker.
- Our work's done here.
What, he got away? How?
You shouldn't underestimate Jarod.
Mm-mmm.
And you should never
underestimate me.
And the next time that you send me
into a building that's gonna explode...
it had better blow...
because if it doesn't,
it's gonna be your gray matter...
they'll be mopping up
with a toothbrush.
By the way,
Jarod left you something.
[Mr, Parker On Answering Machine]
Oh, my angel,
God, I'm sorry I missed you.
I wanted to hear your voice. Needed to.
Now, if you don't hear from me,
don't you worry,
Brigitte and I are safe,
At least I think I am,
It's always when you think you are,
that's when you're the most vulnerable,
Now, don't you make
the same mistake I did,
Now, don't expose the soft underbelly,
They target that,
No, no, no, You catch Jarod
and never, ever let him go,
Damn it! He's the key,
He's the only key, Always has been,
And there's one last thing-
[Sighs]
'Cause I know you're tough,
I'm not worried,
You watch your back at the Centre,
Nobody's what they seem to be,
There's no soul in that place-
not one- that you can trust...
with the possible exception
of your brother,
[Chattering]
Who the hell are you?
My name is Jarod.
Have you seen this woman?
- Like I said, who the hell are you?
- I'm her brother.
Damn, She's gonna be sorry
she missed you, but she just left today,
She wouldn't say where. Sort of like
she thought someone was followin' her.
Sweet girl.
- Was she alone?
- Yeah, but she didn't want to be.
She was searchin' for her family.
Said she was determined to find them.
Like I said...
she'd be sorry
if she knew she missed you.
Yeah.
[Electricity Crackling]
[Rings]
What?
At least we put
one family back together.
- While mine got ripped apart again.
- I know the feeling.
You know, Jarod, maybe Lyle's right.
Maybe the world is changing.
It doesn't seem to matter
how much it changes.
It's still the same for us.
We're still alone in it.
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
[Man]
Jarod booked out of here
a couple days ago.
I sure miss that old boy.
- To know him is to love him.
- Amen, brother.
I kind of took him under my wing,
so to speak. Yeah, I kept my eye on him.
I'm sure that's just like you, Junior,
always thinking of the other guy.
I believe in helpin' those
less fortunate.
"Darwin Transport."
Yep, this is it.
- This is what? Jarod stayed in that?
- Yep.
He'd lock himself in there
for three, four days at a time.
Paid me to check in on him
now and again.
You know, bring him a little bread,
some water, chain him up-
- [Together] Chain him up?
- Live and let live.
That's my motto, especially when
there's cash comin' myway.
Hell, he'd even ask me to zap him
with a carbattery now and then.
Whatever turns you on, I guess.
- Why, Jarod!
-Jarod!
I didn't know you was in there!
I got ya, didn't I?
[Wheezy Laugh]
Buy yourself a fifth of happiness.
I couldn't get a shot of joy for this.
There's no place like home.
Well, they say there's a fine line
between genius and insanity.
[Miss Parker]
Jarod's line was erased long ago.
Huh. What's a home without TV?
- That's Jarod's handwriting.
- Since when do we follow his directions?
There's always a method
to Jarod's madness.
So if it says don't touch, don't touch.
- [Buzzer Sounds]
- [Miss Parker] Lyle!
Oh, no.
It won't budge.
Junior? Junior!
[Junior]
Seeyou later, Miss Parker, Mr. Lyle!
Oh, damn it!
We never told that
scum-toothed idiot our names!
Jarod set this up.
Now we're his prisoners.
[Helicopter Passing Overhead]
Worst heat wave we've had in years...
and this one's been locked
in the hole for three days.
We're gonna need to scrape him out
with a shovel.
[Jarod]
Thanks, but that won't be necessary.
I could use a shower, though.
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
[Miss Parker]
He defends the weak and abused.
[Jarod]
Life's a gift..
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
# [Jarod Whistling]
Good morning, gentlemen.
- [Groans]
- Excuse me, sir.
If you don't mind my saying...
it's creepy that you just spent
the last three days in the same hole
Officer Rion hung himself.
Sometimes, you gotta walk
in somebody else's shoes...
to understand
what they've been through.
Call it a... simulation.
Is that something they teach you
in criminal investigation training?
It's just something I picked up
as a kid. Lieutenant-
Kimbrall. Molly Kimbrall.
I'm with the provost marshal's office.
-Jarod Stevens.
- Yeah, I know.
The base's grapevine
is pretty much sizzling...
with word that C.I.D.'s here
investigating Rion's suicide.
Colonel Dance assigned me to escort you around.
He wants to see you in his offiice A.S.A.P.
- He's a little pissed.
- Pissed?
Ticked off.
- You know, mad?
- Why should he be mad?
I've only kept him waiting
72 hours and 13 minutes.
[Man] I am honored
you finally decided to pay me a visit...
even if it did take you
three and a half days.
I was just doing a little recon,
trying to be a good soldier.
That's an understatement.
Top 10 in your class at West Point.
J.D. with honors.
Georgetown Law.
And I saw Rambo 27 times.
Captain Saunders here is the leader
of Rion's training unit.
- He was there the night he died.
- We'll be doing some talking, Captain.
- Most definitely.
- Your file tells me damn near
everything except your rank.
I don't even know if you're
supposed to call me "sir."
Well, that is the army. Not only
does it promote the incompetent...
but it allows C.I.D. offiicers
like myself to kick around anyone...
from a private to a general
regardless ofrank.
But if it makes you feel any better,
I'll call you "sir."
Would you excuse us for now?
Gladly, Colonel.
Let me know if there's anything
I can do to help, sir.
Afteryou, Lieutenant.
Okay, Stevens, let's just stop
all this nice crap.
- Agreed?
- Fair enough.
P.O.W. survival training
is about the systematic breaking down...
of a man's psyche, his identity,
even his will to live.
It's about survival.
Now, it is my duty...
to see who can and cannot
pass that test.
If a man fails here,
he goes down alone.
But if he fails that test in war,
he takes his brothers down with him.
Now, that's all very noble,
but let me tell you about my duty, Colonel.
Your duty is akin
to a snake in the grass.
Around here,
we protect and police our own.
We don't need some Pentagon copperhead
slithering around our feet.
Maybe the late
Warrant Officer Rion does.
Rion's death was
investigated thoroughly.
He was in the hole during P.O.W. training,
and he snapped.
- And mutilated and hung himself.
- He snapped!
Now, anyfurther investigation
will be a waste of your time...
and, more importantly, mine.
Rion's parents are convinced that
their son's death was not a suicide.
They can't accept the fact
that Scott killed himself.
Now, it ain't pretty,
but it is true.
The truth is exactly
what I intend to find out...
sir.
# [Classical]
[Chuckles]
Whoa.
Yes, I'm studying the impact
of unique physical characteristics...
on sensory processing.
I would have guessed that.
There's something weird...
about this shipping invoice
that Jarod left at his last lair.
- Weird how?
- It's such an obvious clue.
It's like Jarod wanted Miss Parker and Mr. Lyle
to go down to Texas and investigate it.
Maybe he did.
What else did Jarod leave?
Some army stuffi-
manuals, books, equipment.
A- A worn-out Rambo video.
But there's just so much stuff...
I haven't had time
to go through it all yet.
We need to alert
Miss Parker and Lyle...
as this may be relevant
to their investigation.
That's the other weird part.
No one's heard from them yet.
It's like they just vanished.
[Miss Parker] I can't get
a signal out through these walls.
Screw signals.
- Why don't you just point it at my head? Huh?
- Don't tempt me.
- What the hell kind of game
is Jarod playing anyway?
- Hmm. Let's see.
He locks us both in here together
for God knows how long...
with nothing but a bucket of
stagnant water and a roll of toilet paper.
It doesn't take much time to figure out
this isn't just a game of survival.
This is survival of the fittest.
[Mr. Lyle] Well, at least
he's not a complete jerk.
He left us some army rations.
- [Monitor Beeps]
- Miss Parker. Mr. Lyle.
Welcome to your home
away from home.
Revise that last statement.
He is a complete jerk.
For all the years that I was
locked away at the Centre...
and for the three years I've been out,
the key to my life has been survival.
A fun little game.
Now ask yourselves...
what would you do to survive?
I found it's important to know yourself
and to know your family.
Have a good time.
Oh, by the way...
I've whipped you up
a yummy little meal.
Hope you enjoy it.
Mmm-mmm!
Barbecued grasshoppers.
[Chuckles]
Bon appetit.
Actually, they're supposed to be
very high in protein.
Tastes like liquorice.
What about you? What are you
willing to do to survive, Miss Parker?
[Gulps]
Mmm.
- Oh! Oh! [Spits]
- [Object Clatters]
A key.
Clever.
Another little piece
to Wolfgang Puke's puzzle.
I think I chipped my tooth.
Great. What next?
[Beeping]
[Jarod] So you've been here
ever since O.C.S. and M.P. school?
- You read my file.
- I'm C.I.D. I'm supposed to snoop.
You're a very capable officer.
Shouldn't you have your bars by now?
The reason I'm not a captain yet
has less to do with ability
than it does with biology.
It's not easy to be a woman
in this man's army, huh?
Chief Rion used to remind me that.
- You knew Rion pretty well?
- We were friends.
He treated me with respect,
not like some of these gung-ho idiots.
He was nice.
Really nice.
Is it true he called his parents the night
before he started P.O.W. training?
I'm the one who's supposed
to snoop, remember?
Sorry. It's just rumor is...
he told his father that someone on base
committed a breach of conduct...
which he was going to report when he
got back from the P.O.W. isolation test.
I guess he never got the chance
to make that report, did he?
No, sir.
I guess not.
The training area's just up the road...
but I doubt you'll find Sergeant Reed
any more helpful than Colonel Dance was.
Sealy, Sealy, Sealy.
Sealy!
It's hot out here, isn't it, Sealy?
[Sighs] That sure hit the spot.
You want some?
Want a sip? Huh?
Damn, I've been doin' that all day.
- Hang tough, Airborne.
- Don't crack, Sealy!
All you gotta do is quit, Sealy.
- [Car Door Closes]
- Quit.
You can go over there
and drink as much as you want.
We'll take you back to your nice,
air-conditioned room.
Take a nice, long, cold shower.
And after that,
you get to call your mommy...
tell her to come pick you up
at the airport on the first flight home!
- Is that what you want, Sealy?
- I'm not giving up, Sergeant.
- Hang tough, Sealy.
- Don't crack!
Mr. C.I.D. Step into my office.
[Man]
Don't give up!
I understand that you were in charge of
training the night that Chief Rion died.
Not only that, but I'm the one...
who opened up the hole
and found him hanging by his belt.
It's all in the report.
You must at least have a theory
about what happened.
He went in there by himself,
stayed down there all night by himself.
We were all right outside
the whole time.
Boy must've been scared of the dark
all I can figure.
Let his mind get the best of him.
- Enough to mutilate and hang himself?
- Never got a chance to ask him.
- You here to arrest me?
- Not today.
Good, 'cause I got work to do.
See, these boys are still alive.
It's my job to keep it that way.
[Rion's Voice] "Dear Mom and Dad,
We're almost finished here.
"I can't tell you how much
this opportunity means to me.
"Ever since I was little,
I've wanted to be on the Special Forces...
"just like Dad was.
"Our talks about his experience
as a P.O. W. in Vietnam...
"prepared me for what I had to
go through here in training.
"And like he always said, the most
important survival tool is the mind.
"I miss you both very much and
look forward to us being together soon.
Your loving son, Scott."
We should've heard something by now.
There's been no word from Miss Parker...
no word from Mr. Lyle,
no answer on their cell phones.
- Syd, I'm gettin' kind of freaked here.
- I'm concerned as well.
You think their disappearance
has something to do with Jarod?
All those military manuals we found in his lair,
don't they all have a survival component?
- Yeah.
- I'm going to send
another Sweeper team to Texas.
Broots, dig deeper into that shipping
manifest and all the other items we found.
Okay, I'm on it like a cheap suit.
What are you up to, Jarod?
Some P.O. W.s returned from the brutality
and isolation ofprison camp intact...
others as mere shadows
of the man they once were.
- [Young Jarod] They seem haunted.
- You're right.
[Young Sydney]
Study these men,Jarod.
Help us understand why
some survive and some shatter.
- [Knocking]
- Come in.
I found Cap-
Captain Saunders and the rest
of Chief Rion's unit...
- sort of.
- Where?
Well, they finished
the P.O.W. phase of their training...
and headed out to the south range
for some kind of initiation.
- Initiation?
- Yeah.
They could be anywhere
in this 50-square-mile area.
Well, I guess I better
bring my canteen.
Um, nothing personal, sir,
but you'll never find them.
They are experts.
They just go out there and disappear.
[Man]
Brand's ready, Captain Saunders.
You've earned it, soldier.
Give me the bottle.
Take a hit.
- You ready?
- I'm ready, sir.
[Yelling]
- Whoo! Yeah!
- You did it, man! You did it!
Is this what they call
a weenie roast?
- How the hell did you find us, C.I.D.?
- I followed your tracks.
- We don't leave tracks, Stevens.
- Call them what you will.
But there was a pressure indentation
by the creek bed...
a stone was kicked over
by the outcropping...
and someone with a size 11 -and-a-half
boot has a crack in their heel.
Sending up a flare
would have been less conspicuous.
You know, I'd be careful who the hell
you're sneakin' up on, C.I.D.
And I'd be careful
about violating regulations.
This is tradition, and it's voluntary.
- Right, Sealy?
- Yes, sir.
Demolitions man.
- Yes, sir.
- You don't find that very often
in survival training.
We all come from
different disciplines.
I was a medical officer,
counterintelligence.
Rion was logistics.
Duvall here took his place.
And Walker's our weapons expert.
Different disciplines, one mind,
body and soul.
- We train to become a team.
- So you all knew Scott Rion pretty well.
When your training's about survival,
it's as important...
to get to know your friends
as it is to get to know your enemies.
- Your life depends on it, sir.
- A whole lot of good that did Scott Rion.
- Scott had his own problems.
- What kind?
Personal.
In fact, I sensed he was fallin' apart.
There were times I even
covered forhim during training.
Look, I wanted Rion to make it.
We all... wanted Rion to make it.
And I guess I should've gone to the colonel,
but I was afraid he'd kick Rion out.
Maybe if I had, he'd still be alive.
Well, like you said...
it's as important
to know your friends...
as it is to know your enemies.
[Horn Honking]
[Mr. Lyle]
We need fluids, or we'll dehydrate.
This tooth'll kill me before then.
When it comes to survival, Jarod
doesn't know the first thing about me.
Too bad you quit smoking.
Give it up, Daniel Boone.
Brr! I bet it's getting
pretty cold in there.
I hope you two are getting along okay.
You know what they say:
When opposite polarities come together,
things can get hot pretty quickly.
Oh, in case anybody's interested, there's
a tube of Anbesol in there somewhere.
Searching for it can keep you warm.
No. Matches for a fire
would keep me warm.
Shut up and find the Anbesol.
"Opposite polarities."
Oh, great.
We'll suffocate.
Found the Anbesol.
I bet you're glad I'm here now.
You can thank me later.
We're gonna choke on the smoke...
if I don't get this thing sealed.
I need... duct tape.
Perfect.
- Gotta hand it to Jarod.
- [Tape Ripping]
They say duct tape
is the best thing to have...
in a survival situation.
- Very clever.
- [Tape Ripping]
But he's not as clever
or smart as he thinks he is.
Few people are.
[Kimbrall]
What are you doin' here so late?
- I was going over files
in Colonel Dance's office.
- After midnight?
Well, I guess you didn't get the memo
on the colonel's new "open door" policy.
You do like to ruffle feathers,
don't you?
Hop in.
I'll give you a ride home.
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car!
[Animal Howling]
Taking a stroll down
memorylane, Sealy?
- You scared me, Stevens.
- Well, there's a lot of that going around tonight.
Somebody tried to blow up
me and Lieutenant Kimbrall.
Somebody who knows their way
around a firecracker.
It wasn't me. If it had have been,
they'd be mopping you up about now.
I see.
So, you having trouble sleeping?
I just thought I'd take a walk.
To the place where Chief Rion died.
Interesting.
You can still hear him, can'tyou?
His screams.
His pain.
I was here when it happened.
It was his last night in the hole.
He was down there
howlin' and screamin' all night...
callin' out Captain Saunders's name...
and yellin' all kinds of crazy stuff.
[Groaning]
[Yelling]
It was horrible listening
to him the whole night.
Then around daybreak,
it just stopped.
I thought he passed out
till Sergeant Reed opened the door...
and we saw him...
hanging from the ceiling.
He'd gone and scratched himself all up.
It was like something out of a horror movie.
I don't know who or what
could cause someone to flip out like that.
I swear I don't.
- Why didn't you get him out?
- I wanted to. We all did.
- But we were ordered not to.
- Captain Saunders?
And Sergeant Reed. They said if we pulled
Rion out, he'd be kicked out of training.
So they just left him
down there to die.
It's not like they knew
he'd kill himself.
How could anyone have known?
[Mr. Lyle] It hasn't been easy
trying to put the murders out of my mind.
Looks like you've done
a pretty good job.
I met Sue at the University of Virginia.
She was part of an exchange program
with her sister Cindy.
One night, I stopped by their apartment.
The door was open.
So I went on in and found 'em-
what was left of them-
in the bedroom.
I was a suspect at first.
Then the police found a roll of duct tape...
in the trunk of
Cindy's ex-boyfriend's car.
The same tape that had
been used on both sisters.
Or maybe someone planted
the duct tape on an innocent man.
You know, to survive.
Don't you see what Jarod's trying to do?
Whether it's in this trap...
or at the Centre, he's trying
to keep us from trusting each other.
You've gotta trust me, Parker.
It's a must for our survival.
What's that?
Parker?
Parker?
You think of everything,
don't you, Jarod?
What's the watch about?
Survival.
Sydney! Syd!
That Sweeper team you sent to Texas-
They didn't find them,
but they interviewed some bum...
who had taken Miss Parker and Mr. Lyle
to a shipping container
where Jarod had been living.
- The shipping container-was it still there?
- Oh, no, it's gone.
I can't find it. All anyone
seems to know is that it's heading east.
- Along with Parker and Lyle?
- But that's not all.
For 10 bucks, the bum
told the Sweepers that...
Jarod had turned the container
into a kind of a P.O.W. camp...
and that he was the prisoner.
- Hmm. Survival.
- Exactly.
I sifted through everything
from Jarod's lair.
Most of it is used in training at military,
P.O.W. and survival units across the country.
Jarod may have been
at one ofthese facilities.
Or still may be.
- [Young Jarod] I've evaluated the data, Sydney.
- And what have you determined?
It's not necessarily the prisoner
who suffered the most physically...
orwere held in captivity the longest who
experienced the most significant trauma.
Then what is the critical factor
to their survival?
[Young Jarod]
Their minds, Sydney.
Their will to survive.
If the captor removes their hope...
their ability to understand
their fears and overcome them...
the prisoner loses his grip
on reality, self-destructs.
[Imitating Ricky Ricardo]
Lucy, you got some explainin' to do.
- I saw that on a rerun.
- This isn't what it looks like.
I hope not, 'cause it sure doesn't look
very good to my friend over here.
I came here to look
in Chief Rion's file.
I can't just sit back
and hope this all goes away.
I have to find out
what really happened to Scott.
You don't believe that
it was just a suicide either, doyou?
I don't know what to believe.
All I know is Scott's family
deserves the truth.
And if that means risking my commission
to get it to 'em, then so be it.
What you're risking is your life.
That bomb in your car
wasn't meant for me.
Why don't you tell me
about Captain Saunders.
I see the way he looks atyou.
Well, when no one's around,
he's touched me...
inappropriately.
- How long has this been going on?
- A few months.
[Sighs]
First, it was just comments.
Suggestions.
You get used to that kind of crap
when you're a female in the military.
You just learn to ignore it
and hope it stops.
- But it didn't?
- No.
- And you told Scott about it?
- [Scoffs]
I made him promise not to tell anyone.
What happened?
About a week before Scott's death...
I went off base to meet
some friends for dinner.
Captain Saunders was there,
Chief Rion, the rest of the unit.
Captain Saunders kept staring at me...
to the point that it was scaring me.
So I got up and left.
I just wanted to get out
of there and go home.
Captain Saunders grabbed me.
He wouldn't let go. I tried to fight him.
- I was yelling at him to let go of me.
- Get off of me!
But he wouldn't stop.
I was so scared.
He was trying to push me into the car.
Then, all of the sudden,
someone pulled him off of me.
Scott Rion.
He told Captain Saunders
he was going to report him.
They argued. Captain Saunders
told Scott he'd forgotten the first rule-
that the unit always comes first.
He said it wasn't over
between them...
that he'd make sure
Scott learned his lesson.
When Scott committed suicide,
I felt responsible.
Scott did commit suicide,
but it wasn't by choice.
I don't understand.
His psychological profile
showed no signs ofinstability.
Prisoner of war training is tough...
but Scott knew he only had
to endure one more night.
Then what could have made him
go out ofhis mind?
Something I found in his mind.
You're saying he was given something
to make him go crazy?
That's what hewas trying to tell us.
He wasn't mutilating himself.
He was writing a word.
Scott knew he was drugged.
Hewas attempting to tell us
who did it and how.
That seems so impossible.
Rion knew that Saunders was involved
in a secret research project...
to develop drugs to interrogate
prisoners of war.
The name of that project was-
[Kimbrall]
"Abyss."
Scott knew he was given
the Abyss drug.
As he became more
psychotic and disoriented...
he attempted to tell us.
So what are you gonna do about it?
I'm going to give Captain Saunders...
a little taste of his own medicine.
It's okay to drink now.
Trust me.
"Tick tock."
Jarod wanted you to find that watch.
He knew it meant something to you.
It was my-
our mother's.
She won it in a swim competition
when she was little...
and Daddy gave it to me
for my 12th birthday.
I used to use it to time myself...
treading water when
we would go to the lake.
And this one particular morning,
it was early.
I took the skip out alone,
and I went way out into the middle.
I t started taking on water,
and before I could make it back, it sank.
And I tried to swim...
but it was just so far.
All I could do was tread water
and hope someone would find me.
My legs were cramping, and my arms
were aching. It was terrifying.
Every time I wanted to give in...
and to surrender to the pain,
to let myself sink...
I would hear the ticking of this watch.
And it was like Mother's voice
whispering to me...
to fight for my life-
to fight to survive.
And I did.
[Scoffs]
Anyway...
eventually Daddy came and rescued me.
But it was this watch
that saved my life.
- I lost it a long time ago.
- Looks like somebody found it.
[Engine Shuts Off]
What now?
Syd! Syd!
I found it.
I found the container,
and you're not gonna believe where.
- [Pounding]
- [Broots] Miss Parker? Miss Parker?
Broots? Broots, you lovable moron,
is that you?
Yeah, I guess.
- Open the door!
- [Sydney] You'll have to do it.
- What?
- [Broots] It says out here:
"To open,
pull the "Do not pull' lever inside."
Really!
[Buzzer Sounds]
Jarod shipped us back to the Centre?
- Ironic, isn't it?
- It's a regular junior jumble.
When I catch him, I'm gonna kill him.
- Well, you may get your chance.
- We tracked him to an army survival camp.
- Where?
- It's in Texas...
right next to the container yard
where you started.
Welcome back, ladies.
Sorry to ruin your "R" and "R"...
but we have new orders to move up your
three-day survival solo into the wilderness.
You'll be assigned separate quadrants.
Your mission is to escape and evade
for the next 72 hours.
All that you need
and all that you are getting...
is in your gear,
which you can pick up at the table.
- Make me proud! Let's go!
- [All Shouting]
- Let's go!
- Make me proud!
Let's go! Come on!
- [Shouting Continues ]
- Move it!
- Let's go!
- All right!
[Yelling]
[Jarod]
Wake up, Saunders.
Wake up!
Where am I?
What's happening?
I bet Scott Rion
asked himself the same question.
- Who's in here?
-Just demons in your mind.
- And victims fromyourpast.
- [Gasps]
What's the matter, Saunders?
Feeling a little crazy?
- Stevens, is that you?
- You look scared.
Scared to death!
[Yells]
This is gonna cost you your commission.
Well, it can't really cost me my commission,
because I don't really have one.
The truth is, my name's not Stevens.
I'm not even in the army.
[Chuckles]
What have you done to me?
The same thing you did to Scott Rion.
[Echoing]
Rion hung himself.
He couldn't cope.
I told you that!
Because of the hallucinogens
you put in his M.R.E.
Drugs you designed to increase
his feelings of fear and terror.
Man, this is crazy!
Almost as crazy
as Scott Rion must have felt...
when you left him
in the hole all night!
As the drug took control of his mind,
he had two options-
either go crazy, or kill himself.
No! No!
You knew he was going to report you
for the sexual harassment of Lt. Kimbrall.
You would have been court-martialed,
lost your precious career.
You can't prove any of it.
You can't prove it.
That's why I whipped up
my own little special batch...
of Abyss.
- [Gasping]
- As you know, it starts out slowly.
And then it builds,
getting stronger with each wave...
until your mind slowly
slips into insanity.
It should be kicking in
pretty well right now.
Your eyes playin' tricks on you?
Your skin crawling?
Your mind losing its grip?
Oh, uh, the key to your handcuff is.
You should have your hands free
in case you wanna mutilate yourself.
Well, gotta go now.
Have fun in your own private little...
hell.
Oh, one more thing.
Rion's belt...
just in case you would want
to, uh, hang around.
- Have fun.
- Wait! Wait! Don't leave me in here!
Wait! Don't leave!
[Whimpering]
Let me out, man!
Look. You're right!
Okay? I did it! I did it!
[Panting]
I drugged him.
[Sobbing]
I drugged him.
Come on, man!
Let me out!
Mmm- Uh-uh.
Let me out!
How long should
we leave him in there?
The drug should wear off
in a couple of hours. After that...
he'll just weep.
[Panting]
Let me out!
[Kimbrall] The colonel assures me
Saunders will get everything he deserves.
Twenty to life
at Leavenworth minimum.
And Rion's family will get a full apology
and disclosure of what happened.
From Colonel Dance personally.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
And I have a feeling...
those bars of yours
won't be long in coming.
You know, I don't know
your rank, Jarod...
but I am honored to call you "sir."
Thank you.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to practice some of those...
escape and evasion skills
I've learned here.
Good luck.
[Phone Ringing]
- What?
- [Jarod] Aside from the chipped molar...
- it sounds like you survived.
- No thanks to you.
Actually, everything you needed
was there all along.
All you had to do
was open your eyes and see.
What exactly was it
I was supposed to see?
That survival comes down
to knowing the difference...
between your friends
and your enemies.
I suppose you're trying
to tell me that...
Lyle is my enemy
and you're my friend.
Maybe. And you have to be willing...
to do whatever it takes to survive.
You can sure bet that Lyle will.

I would like a double-dip vanilla
with granola sprinkles, please.
- Truck ain't open.
- Uh, I have cash money.
It's 7:30 in the freakin' morning.
Why don't you try the Waffle House?
Considering the iron,
calcium and lactose in the ice cream...
the carbohydrate value of the cone
and the fiber content of the granola...
one could, in reality, receive more nutritious
ingredients in one Tasty Surprise...
than in an entire
bacon and egg breakfast.
- Are you some kind of nut?
- No. I just like ice cream.
Yeah.
- Taxi!
- [Man] I don't understand.
The police looked through my
daughter's room once already.
- What did you say your name was?
- Waxman. Detective Jarod Waxman.
The other officer said a teenager
missing less than 48 hours...
wasn't gonna be
a high priority case.
We reconsidered the situation.
Was there anything
out ofordinary going on...
in your daughter's life
before she disappeared?
Something bothering her?
[Man] My wife passed away
three years ago.
- Cancer.
- I'm sorry.
And it's been hard for me,
but not like it's been for Jesse.
She just barely turned 15.
She was at an age where a girl
really needs her mother.
And I guess I just didn't have
the answers that she needed.
Maybe she went away with a friend,
someone from school?
Jesse's shy. She doesn't have
much of a social life.
I don't know. It's like she
just vanished into thin air.
She seemed to have
a special interest in angels.
Yeah. When her mother passed away...
Jesse started collecting them,
reading books about them.
That one's her favorite.
- Have you seen this before?
- No, never.
"Gates of Hell."
That's Jesse's handwriting.
You've got to help me.
My daughter's life
is in your hands, Detective.
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift..
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
A man with no face?
It reminds me of a young man
I recently hired...
to help restore
a broken-down old wax museum.
- Mr. Kleinman, I didn't even
hear you come in.
- [Chuckling]
Oh, a gift for a friend?
More like... a message.
Ah. I brought you a snack.
- Ooh, I hope it's ice cream.
- Better. A delicacy.
Alcatraz oysters.
These little beauties you can
find only in San Francisco Bay.
Go ahead. Eat.
Enjoy. Yeah.
- Eh?
- Mmm.
- They're very good.
- [Chuckling]
[Sniffs]
You know what?
This just might do the trick.
You are a very strange
young man, Jarod.
Not half as strange as the people
I'm sending this to.
Jarod, are you sure you wouldn't
want to stay upstairs?
Actually, I spend a lot of time alone.
It's sort of nice to have the company.
-Ah.
-Mr. Kleinman, have you ever
seen anything like this before?
[Gasps]
My God!
Where did you get this?
A man I know is searching
for his daughter.
- You have seen it.
- Yeah.
- I have seen it.
- You're a Holocaust survivor.
Members of the S.S.
wore similar symbols...
on their uniforms.
- Devils. Demons.
- This man-
He's worried
for his daughter's safety.
Oh, he should be.
He should be scared
to death.
# [Techno, Man Singing, Indistinct]
# [Man Screaming]
# [Singing Resumes]
Didn't your mother ever tell you
it's rude to stare?
I hardly knew my mother.
- See something you like?
- I'm confused.
- Doesn't all that... hurt?
- That's the idea, slick.
So you enjoy...
self-inflicted pain?
You're screwin' with my head, right?
Actually, I'm looking for someone.
A young man. A magician.
Throw a rock, baby cakes.
Yeah, I've seen Hawk
handing these out to a select few.
He's holding court in the back room.
- You can't miss him.
- Thank you.
And when you're finished playing games
with the bird man, come back.
- I'll show you a real magic show.
- That would be enjoyable. Thank you.

Most people can't comprehend
the very world they inhabit.
They exist,
but they don't experience.
They look, but they never see.
I believe that they're portals-
windows to the body,
the mind and the spirit.
Given the perfect exchange of energies,
these windows can be opened.
Pass beyond.
I look at you.
I look into you...
and I see tremendous sorrow,
emptiness.
I want you to think about
what was taken from you.
I magine in your mind's eye
the cause of your suffering.
- I- I don't-
- Shh. Trust me.
I want you to think about the object
of your pain. Can you see it?
Yes.
I offer you this gift...
with all my love.
[Gasps]
Oh, my God!
- How could you-
- Who is Clare?
Sh-She's my- my twin sister.
[Murmuring]
- And where is she?
- She was killed...
in a car accident when we were two.
[Sobbing]
But how could you know that?
Simple.
Your heart told me.
Tell us again about
the Angel's Flight.
What's Angel's Flight?
It was a dream the great Houdini
had repeatedly throughout his life.
Or nightmares, some believe.
Houdini felt, given the power of angels,
he could break free...
from the boundaries ofEarth
and soarin the heavens like a god.
But, unfortunately, he wasn't.
And when he died,
his dream died with him.
Hawk says the Angel's Flight
is attainable.
Close enough to touch.
I suggest we assemble again
at midnight for a reading session.
Go with the angels.
- [Girl] This is too heavy for me.
- [Boy] This guy is awesome.
- They seem to be very... loyal.
- I offer them something they need.
- Something their worlds have denied them.
- # [Techno, Woman Singing]
- Magic.
- Love.
My name is Jarod.
I hear you have a great gift-
the ability to touch people.
- And you desire this gift.
- I wish to learn from the best.
And why should I open myself
to a stranger?
# [Continues]
[Blowing]
The perfect exchange of energy.
Kessler will show you the way.
# [Continues]
- Midnight.
- You don't seem to share Hawk's
belief in the power of angels.
- Excuse me?
- When the subject of Angel's Flight came up...
you seemed rather uncomfortable.
- # [Continues]
- Midnight.
Where are you, fallen angel?
Where are you?
Don't even talk to me
unless it's good news. Broots?
You're not gonna be happy.
It's not good news.
- Any sign of Jarod?
- It's like he vanished into a black hole.
- Kind of like your personal life?
- Tell me about it.
- [Sydney] That's odd, isn't it?
- [Miss Parker] What, the girl?
Cigar.
Lyle doesn't smoke.
Oh, yeah,
that's a gift.
Jerry, the guy with the glass eye
who works down in Transportation-
well, he told me
that Mr. Lyle is expecting...
some Centre hotshot
from the West Coast.
- [Miss Parker] Did marble-eyed Jerry
give you a name?
- Not that I can remember.
Hmm. That makes him about as
worthless as this shirt then, doesn't it?
- What, did Don Ho have a garage sale?
- Don who?
The box. What's in it?
Oh, yeah. Miss Parker,
this box is for you.
Well, that's something
you don't see every day.
- "Beware of strangers bearing gifts."
- I bet it's from Jarod.
- Gee, you think?
- Maybe he's talkin' about Lyle.
Uh-uh.
Cigars and champagne?
Maybe.
What are you up to now, Jarod?
What are you up to now, Jarod?
[DoorKnob Rattling]
[Hawk] Welcome, my friends,
to the midnight session.
Let us begin.
Please stand.
Common, I know.
Read the date on this coin.
- 1994.
- 1994.
That has special meaning
for you, doesn't it?
- Yes.
- Why?
Because that's the year
my mother died.
Turn the coin over.
Oh!
She-She used to call me her Puppy.
Yes. She's with you.
[Sobbing]
[Whispering]
She'll always be with you.
Thank you.
[Applause]
I see you found your way.
- I wasn't sure which way to go.
- Obviously not that way.
Tight security.
Protecting magic secrets.
Hawk likes to keep
his personal life... personal.
I suggest you join the others.
The reading's already started.
- Can I ask you something?
- If I said no, would you walk away?
Probably not.
- Look familiar?
- Where did you get that?
I like to keep
my personal life... personal.
You don't want to miss the session.
Of course not.
- [Hawk] Your name?
- Uh, Scott.
Stand up, Scott.
It's all right. I won't bite.
[People Chuckling]
You can put that down.
- You're new here.
- Yes.
- You're nervous.
- [Chuckles] A little bit.
- You're also bleeding.
- Bleeding?
Inside.
You were betrayed.
Hurt by someone you trusted,
someone you loved.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do.
It's all right.
It's all right.
- We love you.
- [People, Softly] We love you.
[Gasps]
You couldn't believe it
when it started.
You wanted to scream,
but you were afraid.
- Confused.
- Please don't.
[Hawk] You were so young,
vulnerable.
It was like a nightmare the way
he came at you. So much anger.
I can't do this.
You thought if you closed your eyes,
it would stop.
But it didn't stop, did it, Scott?
It got more violent and angry.
No. No.
[Hawk]
You were afraid to tellanyone.
Afraid to say the name,
terrified that no one would believe you.
I was afraid.
[Sobbing]
You were only a boy,
and he was so powerful, so terrifying.
[Scott]
I wanted him to stop hitting me.
I wanted to say his name.
I know you did.
And now you can.
Now you can say it
for the entire world to hear.
- I can't.
- Say it.
- I can't.
- Say it, Scott!
Say it and end
the nightmare forever!
I can't!
[Sobbing Continues]
I can't.
It's all right.
I'll say it for you.
- [People Gasping]
- It was your father.
It was your father
who beat you, Scott.
I never wanted it to happen.
I know you didn't, Scott.
I know you didn't.
You don't have to
be afraid anymore.
It's okay, Scott.
You should try that on me.
- Maybe I will.
- You think you helped him?
Everyone has secrets,
demons they keep hidden.
And sometimes,
if you don't stop them...
they eat you alive
a piece at a time.
What about you,Jarod?
What kind of demons
are you hiding inside?
That's all for tonight.
Mr. Kessler will collect your offerings.
- Another rush delivery from Jarod?
- Yeah, number three.
Great. Now your boy's yankin'
my crank on an hourly basis.
Jarod never plays these games
without substantial motivation.
It's a head made of Sterno.
- What is it this time?
- Wow!
Another giant leap
into the Twilight Zone.
You were saying something
about motivation?
Substance, Parker.
And there's another note.
"See no evil."
In the box with the ears,
the note was, "Hear no evil."
Anything else on the identity
of Lyle's mystery arrival?
Nothing on the grapevine.
Well, at least we have
Mr. Potato Head.
Cool.
[Beeps]
I finally found you, Jessica.
Kill the son of a bitch.
I was excited to get your call,
even if it was a bit cryptic.
- Found something out about Jessica?
- I'm still working on the case.
Mr. Bracken, you told me
that your wife...
passed away from an illness.
- That's right.
- That's not what really happened, is it?
I wanna help you find your daughter,
but we're running out oftime.
If I'm going to help you,
you have to tell me the truth.
Okay.
Sarah was... vibrant.
Shewas so full of life.
Then she got sick.
All that life just
slowly drained out ofher.
She tried to take the treatment,
but... it was too late.
I don't know why
she went out on that roof.
I don't know... what she
was thinking when she jumped.
The police found her body
in the alley the next morning.
She was still clutching
her angel pendant in her hand.
And that's how Jesse
became obsessed with angels.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I should have told you the truth.
I just, uh, didn't think
that it-
Find my little girl, Detective, please.
She's all I have left.
[Broots]
Speak no evil.
- Anybody recognize him?
- He kinda looks like Gilligan.
- Gilligan?
- Yeah.
You know, the Skipper and the Professor
and Mary Ann and-and Ginger.
You grew up in a trailer park,
didn'tyou?
No, I did not.
It was a mobile home.
It's obvious Jarod is trying to keep us
busy chasing Mr. No Name's identity...
while he skips along
free as he pleases.
- The question is, why all the effort?
- What about the notes?
- Jokes without punch lines.
- Maybe a warning.
- What is that?
- It looks like a-a water stain.
[Sniffs]
Ew!
- Smells like low tide.
- [Sniffs] Wow! They all smell the same.
Maybe Jarod's just
dropping breadcrumbs.
- Have these cards analyzed.
- Okay.
Who are you, pal?
"A History of Fallen Angels."
Fallen... angels.
Hawk says the Angel's Flight
is attainable.
Close enough to touch.
[Echoing]
I don't know why she went out
on that roof. I don't know...
what she was thinking
when she jumped.
[Squeaking]
Jessica.
- [Gun Cocks]
- I hoped you were smarter.
Why couldn't you just walk away
and let this thing finish?
The same reason that you couldn't sit
at that table with Hawk...
and talk about Angel's Flight.
He did this, didn't he?
What happened?
Jesse Bracken
didn't have enough to offer?
Or she found the computer files
that Hawk keeps on the others?
The wealthy, disenfranchised,
young people...
that were recruited
off the streets by you.
That's the game, isn't it?
Dazzle them with magic...
and then take them
for every penny you can.
I told Hawk that we
should just cut and run...
but it was never only
about the money for him.
Angel's Flight was just
the last act of the play.
I swear, sometimes,
the guy really thinks he's gonna fly.
- What happened to her?
- Hawk flipped out a couple of days ago...
and Jesse overheard us
talkin' about the scam.
I just thought he was
gonna talk to her.
- I never thought he'd kill her.
- He didn't.
- What?
- She's still alive.
- Give me the gun and help me
get her out of here.
- No. Hawk-
If you let her die, there is no magic
in the world that's going to save you.
- Now give me the gun.
- All she wanted...
was somebody to care about her,
somebody to watch over her.
Somebody did.
Now give me the gun.

Miss Parker, not only has Jarod topped off
Mr. Potato Head with a nice hairpiece...
I just found out that the stains
on the cards were made by oysters.
- [Sydney] Oysters?
- Mm-hmm.
What are you saying?
Jarod was a sloppy eater?
The residue was left
by a very specific shellfish...
found only in the San Francisco Bay.
I think Jarod wanted us to find him.
San Francisco is a big city.
Well, I started thinking
about the head Jarod left...
so I scraped some of the wax,
and I had it analyzed.
It is used almost exclusively
for the construction of human replication.
- Wax museum.
- [Broots] Touche, Syd.
So I called the Frisco area
and found one defunct wax museum.
And when I called,
this is what I got.
[Jarod] Hello, Sydney, Broots,
and as always, Miss Parker.
I assume since you're listening
to this recording...
you figured out my current location.
I realize things got
a little fishy along the way...
but you realize timing
is everything...
in the "run for your life"
business.
I won't keep you
longer than necessary.
I realize you have
a plane to catch.
I just ask two things:
First, bring along the wax head.
I think you'll find it enlightening.
And second, don't forget to buckle
your seat belts. Happy landings.
- Good work, Broots.
- Thanks, Sydney.
Let's not polish each other's
doorknobs quite yet.
- Get the jet fired up.
We're going to California.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Broots?
- Yes, ma'am?
- Don't wear that shirt.
It makes me nauseous.
- Yes, ma'am.
It does.
[Boat Horn Blaring]
- I have told you. He is gone.
- Sweep it.
- Yes, Miss Parker.
- Was that a gun? Who are you people?
You were saying that Jarod
helped you to remodel the museum.
[Mr. Kleinman] An artist he is,
sent here by the angels.
- So I see.
- [Mr. Kleinman] He redesigned
the movie star exhibit...
the presidential study
and my rose robe.
And he even added a new display.
-Jarod calls it... Centre of Shame.
- Show me.
I have no idea what
it is supposed to mean...
but something tells me you will.
Hey, it's us!
[Chuckling]
Incredibly life like.
[Miss Parker]
It just gets weirder and weirder.
[Broots]
Uh-oh. This can't be good.
[Echoing Laughter]
- I'll be damned!
- [Broots] We just witnessed
our own execution.
- Let's get out of here.
- [Laughter Continues]
[Hawk]
Welcome to the Angel's Flight.
As I look at you all tonight...
I'm filled with divine energy.
The belief in the possibility
of the impossible.
That faith is what separates
the leaders from the followers...
the enlightened from the blind,
the gods... from the mortals.
With your strength and spirit,
all things are possible.
[Jarod]
Looking for your safety line, Hawk?
- Jarod.
- You seem surprised to see me.
I saw the shirt.
Kessler shot you.
Ah-ah-ah.
The first rule of Magic:
Never believe what you see.
Hawk, what's going on?
It seems our friend Hawk here isn't
exactly the magic man he pretends to be.
You want to tell them?
Or should I?
- Go to hell.
- You first.
- What's that?
- It's you. And you. And you.
It's all of you.
Go ahead. Take a look.
Hawk had a personal file
on each and every one of you.
He knew who you were,
who you are, where you're from...
how much you had to...offer.
He knew your deepest fears,
your darkest secrets.
He knew you better
than you knew yourselves.
And in return for his amazing insights,
you gave him whatever you had of value.
And why not?
He saw into your souls, right?
- Why?
- Money.
Unfortunately, not all of you
were so easily led.
That's why you killed Jesse Bracken.
She stumbled onto your computer room,
discovered your little scam.
And that's it.
She had to go.
So you dragged her up here
and you threw her off the roof.
- You can't prove anything.
- Can't I?
Next time you toss someone
off a building...
you'd better make damn sure
you clean up after yourself.
So, you still think...
that you're worthy to fly
with the angels, Hawk?
Or is this just a pathetic curtain call
ofa half-baked magic show?
What are you waiting for?
Divine intervention?
[Hawk]
My final gift to you.
Son of a bitch!
You killed him!
[Jarod] Ah-ah-ah.
Remember what I told you?
The first rule of magic:
Never believe what you see.
I hate to say it,
but Jarod has me stumped this time.
There must be something
that we're not seeing.
[Broots] Eyes, nose, ears, mouth.
It all seems to be there.
See no evil, hear no evil,
speak no evil.
I don't know what it means,
but it gives me a bad feeling.
- Good. You're all still here.
- Where else?
As you may or may not know,
the Triumvirate has decided...
to become more hands-on
in the pursuit ofJarod.
And in an effort to protect
the integrity oftheir pursuit...
an element has been added
to act as a safeguard...
or a safety net, if you will.
Why don't you just say it?
A new player.
You can think of him as
a one-man Internal Affairs Division.
Mr. Cox.
- Cox?
- It's with an "X."
[Chuckles] I hope we get to know
each other better in the coming days.
- No doubt.
- I hate to be rude...
but we really have to leave if we're
gonna make that next appointment.
That answers that.
Brings us to a bigger question.
Who is Mr. Cox?
Jarod already answered that.
He's the Grim Reaper.
- Hi.
- Hey, Detective Waxman.
I was hoping we'd see you again.
I was on my way out of town, and I thought
I would stop by and say good-bye.
- You look good.
- The doctor said it's a miracle
she wasn't killed.
My dad says that you saved my life.
I don't know how to thank you.
Seeing you sitting there smiling
is thanks enough.
They said the man that did this confessed
to running the scam all over the country.
It's good to know he won't be
hurting anybody else's children.
Detective, I know it's not the same
as saving your life...
but I thought maybe
you'd like to have this.
It helped keep me safe.
I hope it'll do the same for you.
I'll keep it close.
Thank you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
I told Jarod he was welcome
in the crew quarters...
but he said he wanted to be here,
nearer the animals.
Careful where you walk.
He let some of them run free.
Let's see if he left.
anything else besides... this stench.
Oh, look at these.
Wild Kingdom, National Geographic.
Hey, here's that crocodile guy.
[Australian Accent]
"That mammoth snake's a real beauty, ain't she?
I'm gonna try and ride her."
You were saying that Jarod
claimed to be an animal behaviorist?
Yeah. Some zoo up north.
Some place in, uh-
Blue Cove, Delaware?
That's where I've been waiting...
since someone failed to notify me
about this little road trip.
- Lyle-
- It's an oversight.
- Your people were gonna call my people.
- Actually, I was going to say-
- [Squishing Sound]
- Watch your step.
So, this is all Jarod did? Just watch TV
and, uh, play with his furry friends?
Actually, he spent most of his time
in front of the chimpanzee cages.
He'd sit there for hours,
mesmerized.
[Sydney]
Jarod knows the agony of being caged.
The prying eyes.
That's why he studied the chimps...
- because he related to them.
- [Laughs]
Nah. He just liked
watching them do it.
- It?
- Yeah, you know, mate.
Okay, weird time.
Hot peppermint-flavored
massage oil.
Feather ticklers.
Edible apparel.
I guess it's all for, uh, for-
Sex, Broots.
The word is sex.
Looks like our little monkey's in heat.
[Woman]
Oh, good morning.
You must be Dr. Kinsey.
Welcome to the Arnett Center.
Thank you, Nurse Plenty?
- Plen-tay.
- Ah.
I took the liberty of
getting you all set up.
Your daily schedule is here.
Your weekly here.
Here's a little pamphlet
to explain the phones.
Andsince I didn't know which you prefer,
I brought you tea and coffee.
Well, thank you very much.
That's great.
At the Arnett Sex Center,
satisfaction is our motto.
Was there something else you needed?
Oh, yes, Doctor.
There is something I need very badly.
Uh, Nurse Plenty, I-
- Plen-tay.
- Uh-
Oh! I am so sorry, Doctor.
Monique slipped right past me.
She's not really a nurse, is she?
- No. She's your 9:00 patient.
- Ah. Monique Brooks.
Suffering from an uncontrollable urge
for sexual role playing.
We all like to pretend
once in a while, don't we, Doc?
Uh-huh.
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift..
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
It went from a couple of
quickies on the dryer-
To the upper deck at Dodger Stadium.
We crave daring places.
Need daring places.
It never occurred to us
that we had a problem.
Until this.
The paramedics said we were lucky
falling off the scoreboard like we did.
If it weren't for the peanut guy?
We might have been killed.
Hmm.
We've been together five years.
And... we're still...
you know-
unspoiled... after five years.
Well, many people choose to wait.
In the grandscheme of things,
five years really isn't that long.
We've been married for four of them.
We have some videos here
I think might help.
Thank you very much!
Just don't try everything
in one night.
Excuse me.
You must be Dr. Kinsey.
- That's what it says on my door anyway.
- I'm Dr. Covney.
- All my patients call me Allen.
- Nice to meet you, Allen.
Hey. How many sex therapists
does it take to change a lightbulb?
Is there a lightbulb
that I can help you change?
It's just- It's just a joke.
[Man] Sort of like the funny ones,
only diffierent. Get used to it, Jarod.
Sex therapy's the butt of a lot of jokes.
The work we do at this clinic is important.
Speaking of which, Dr. Arnett,
my 11:00 group is waiting.
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.
- Jarod, you got a minute?
- Uh, sure.
Syd, do you ever wonder
why these dolls...
always have the same surprised
expression on their face?
- [Snickers]
- Go ahead. Say it.
This is fish in a barrel territory.
Tell me about this stuff, boys.
Looks like Jarod could use a nice cold shower.
[Sydney]
Well, his is an inquisitive mind.
No reason he wouldn't use it
to explore his sensuality.
Syd's fancy way of saying
our boy has his horns up.
[Chuckles]
Horns up.
So, did you find anything useful?
Uh, well, basically whatever
turns you on, baby.
- To locate Jarod?
- Still lookin'. Maybe we'll get lucky.
- I'll keep you posted.
- Thank you.
[Lyle]
Forget to call me again?
Don't worry, Lyle. You can play
with the toys when we're done.
The game's changing.
Due to recent lapses in communication...
I have decided to take a more
supervisory role in the hunt for Jarod.
From now on, you'll report
every aspect of your search to me.
Every aspect.
And if we don't, you'll go up to the Tower
and get us in lots of trouble.
Tattletale will go
so nicely on your resume.
Like you said, watch your step.
Reporting to Mr. Lyle can't be good.
Wonder what that means?
I know what it means to me.
Nothing.
I don't answer to anyone.
Especially my little brother.
This is interesting.
Shipping invoice, no return address.
Just a Web site.
lustyfun.com. This is where Jarod
ordered all the stuff from.
Find a real address on that.
And, Broots, not a word.
- But Mr. Lyle just said we're supposed to-
- Broots.
Think of your worst nightmare.
[Cracks Whip]
Mighty Bobcats from Marrietta University.
You must really like
these Mighty Bobcats.
You're a therapist.
You can use the term obsession.
Don't you have a similar attachment
to your alma mater?
I have a strong feeling
about the place.
Please. Jarod, I want to thank you
for stepping in on short notice...
and taking over for Dr. Blass.
I have to tell you, I'm concerned
about Dr. Blass's patients...
how they're going to
make the transition to you.
Many have spent a long time
developing a trust with her.
Well, I'm going to have to work
very hard to maintain that trust.
You never realize how many lives are affected
when a tragedy like Melissa's happens.
Has her attacker been caught yet?
No. Police are looking for one of her
court referral patients- Luke Carlo.
Melissa was working with him
as a term ofhis probation.
What happened?
Melissa had the admirable tendency
to care too much.
Carlo was a predator.
He took advantage of that.
He called her,
said he was having a crisis.
She ended up downtown
in some dive called the Eros Inn.
I hear she's in pretty bad shape.
She's a shell of who she was.
I just wish that you could have met
the Melissa that we all used to know.
She was a wonderful, loving woman.
[Dr. Arnett On Tape]
Mr. Truly, do you know why you're here?
Yeah. Judge Dettman
thinks I'm a pervert.
Tony?
I'm Dr. Kinsey.
I'm the new guy.
So, I understand you're the one who knows
everything that goes on around here.
Yeah. I live the lowly life of an intern.
I'm also workin' on my master's.
"Psycho-SexualAggression."
"Aberrant Sexual Behavior."
Hmm. Cheery stuff.
My honor's thesis is on sexual predators,
and I watch all the court referred sessions...
so I might as well make good use of it.
- Is this Dr. Arnett working with someone?
- Yeah.
This is your standard trench coat
and sneaker flasher. Here.
[Dr. Arnett] Everyone has fears.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
The key is to acknowledge
and understand them.
Yeah, well, I'm not afraid
of anything.
[Tony] It's amazing what you can learn
about a person's psyche by just watching them.
Mr. Truly, when I was a kid,
my father took me duck hunting.
I was laying out the decoys
and somehow the boat flipped.
I got trapped underneath
in this tiny air pocket.
The water kept rising
up my neck, over my chin.
I was terrified.
I nearly drowned.
To this day, I'm hydrophobic.
A shower, fine.
But a bath, a swimming pool...
the fear rises in me
as fast as the water.
See, fear is natural.
It's healthy even.
But we've got to control it.
We can't let "it" control us.
Did you observe Dr. Blass's sessions
with Luke Carlo?
The guy that assaulted her?
Yeah. There are tapes of that guy
in her office.
Scary dude. He was the kind of guy
that was just wound too tight.
Unfortunately for Dr. Blass, he decided that
she was gonna be the one that he went off on.
Interesting drawing, Broots.
[Clears Throat]
Oh, I was just doodling. It's nothing.
Well, doodling is often the most
direct expression of the unconscious.
And I couldn't help notice there was
a certain resemblance to Miss Parker.
Yeah? Well, it's just
that she's so impressive.
You know, the way she's always in control.
The way she never shows fear.
Oh, God.
Fantasies about coworkers
are perfectly natural, Broots.
I'd be very surprised
if sublimated sexual feelings...
- didn't surface from time to time.
- So, what do I do?
Well, you can't keep
these emotions inside.
Otherwise they'll, uh, control you.
Oh, no. I'm not gonna tell her.
Tell her what?
Another crush, Broots?
Who is it this time?
That double-chinned chick in, uh, R & D?
[Chuckles]
No. Yeah.
Uh,yeah.
But it's two, uh, clefts, one chin.
- # [Music On Computer]
- Oh, look.
It's the address for Jarod's receipt-
lustyfun.com.
All right, Broots, you stay here
and pretend like we're still searching.
- Okay.
- The less Lyle knows, the better.
Aren't we supposed to report
everything we hear?
Aren't you supposed to have a pair?
Uh, Miss Parker, I'll stay.
I have plenty of things to do here.
It's you and me, cowboy.
Saddle up.
Good luck, Broots.
[Woman]
I don't know, Doctor.
I'm just so confused.
I never had to deal
with anything like this before.
[Woman #2]
Gloria, it will be fine, I promise you.
- We're gonna get you through this.
- Dr. Blass?
Oh, Dr. Kinsey.
I'm sorry. I just needed
to look at these old tapes.
I heard your voice.
You were one of Dr. Blass's patients?
Oh, well, she- she was just, uh, helping me
with a problem I had with my boyfriend, Eddie.
I-I just wanted to hear
her advice again.
- There's no one else like her. Excuse me.
- [Phone Ringing]
[Tape Starts, Rewinding]
Gloria, it will be fine. I promise you,
we're gonna get you through this.
Thank you.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Oh.
[Dog Barking In Distance]
[Doorbell Rings]
Put the package in the box.
Oh, I'm not a deliveryman,
Dr. Blass.
I'm a doctor with the clinic.
Go away.
I don't need your help.
Well, actually, I was
hoping to get your help.
You see, I'm taking over
your case load at the clinic.
There's a new patient
I need some advice with.
A young woman. I need to reach her
before she slips over the edge.
[Lock Clicks]
I really wish I could help.
I, uh, don't practice anymore.
Maybe not, but I'm hoping
you still care.
How do I know you really are
who you say you are?
My name is Dr.Jarod Kinsey.
Dr. Arnett hired me. I work
with Dr. Covney, and Tony is the intern.
But anybody could know that.
Well, you're right.
But, uh, Gloria...
she's still having problems
with her boyfriend, Eddie.
[Clicks Tongue]
Gloria.
Please? I won't take up
too much of your time.
You collect shells.
Do you like the ocean?
My grandmother had a beach house
when I was growing up.
She was my sanctuary.
I guess the ocean still reminds me of her.
I was just about to put on some tea.
So, you said something
about a new patient?
Yes. She's suffering
from a generalized anxiety disorder...
brought on by emotional trauma.
Symptoms?
Insomnia, panic attacks
and an overwhelming sense of fear.
The thing is, deep down inside,
I think she really wants to get better...
but the fear stops her.
Some days she's too scared
to even get out of bed.
Her heart races, she can't breathe.
She feels like she's losing control.
The thing that really worries me
is she's beginning to think...
that ending it all
is the only way out.
There's no new patient, is there?
Like I told you before,
I don't want your help.
Maybe if you just talked about
the night you were attacked?
- No, I can't.
- Just try.
- Look, my head is all just twisted
and jumbled.
- Melissa?
Just try.
I went downtown to this hotel one of my pa-
one of my patients was staying in.
Luke Carlo.
The door was open, so I walked in.
There was a... hand
clamped over my mouth.
And... a blindfold.
Handcuffs.
Handcuffs with Luke Carlo's
fingerprints on them?
- [Breathing Heavily]
- [Pills Rattling]
Luke. I thought he was
getting better, you know?
I thought I was helping him.
- You have to go now.
- It's not a very good idea
for you to mix those things.
I know that.
Can you please just go?
- We should just go sit-
- Please go!
Okay. Okay.
It's not like I ever hurt anybody.
I just like to look, all right?
No, it is not all right.
You are victimizing these women.
So what we have to do
is find a better way...
for you to deal
with your sexual impulses.
Deal with them.
Lady, you have no idea
what it's like in my neighborhood.
Around here,
sex is all secrets and whispers.
There it's sold in the streets.
It's in your face 24-7.
It doesn't take a genius to figure out
why they call it the "Flesh District."
[Rewinding]
It doesn't take a genius...
to figure out why they call it
the "Flesh District."
The "Flesh District."
The "Flesh District."
[No Audible Dialogue]
Excuse me.
I'm looking for this guy.
I don't see nobody.
Nobody sees you. The best eyes
to see the world with are invisible.
You've spent some time
on the streets.
You could say that.
He's supposed to be a regular around here.
Walked by here just a minute ago.
I see him around here all the time.
When in doubt, liquor store
down the street.
- There he is, right there.
- Thanks.
[Clattering]
What do you want with me?
I want to talk to you  about Dr. Blass.
I didn't have nothin' to do with that.
- Is that why you're pointing a gun at me?
- I didn't do it.
I'm tellin'you.
I didn't... do it!
I didn't do it!
This isn't sleazy.
It's Beaver Cleaver's house.
This is not exactly what I would have
expected from lustyfun.com.
Behind all the aluminum siding,
suburbia's a freak show.
Miss Parker, can I ask you something?
You see, Sydney has this theory
about expressing your feelings...
not bottling up your emotions.
Is this more about you and the chins?
Yeah. Uh, no.
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Well, kind of.
- Broots.
No woman worth her salt wants
to be with a guy who spills
his feelings all over the floor.
You like this chick,
either make a move or move on.
- [Door Opens]
- Hi. We're here to shop.
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Something exotic for hubby?
- [Sniffs]
- I'm afraid I can't help you.
I guess Jarod lied to us, honey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're friends of Jarod's?
Come on in!
[Chuckles]
Sorry about the hassle.
Gotta keep a low profile for the neighbors.
This is my wife, Linda.
I'm Roy.
God bless the Internet.
A few months ago- sex toys, experimenting-
it was just a hobby with us.
Of course, I don't have to tell
you two about that, now do I?
Mmm. It'd be nice if you didn't.
So, uh, Roy, how do you know Jarod?
Never met. Except in chat rooms
and the humongous order he laid on us.
It got my wife's attention,
I can tell you that.
[Chuckles]
Yeah, we're still shippin' him
stuff on back order.
Really? You know,
he just recently moved.
- You don't happen to have
his new address, do you?
- Well, yeah.
I think he gave it to us, yeah.
Yeah. 1248 Wren Park, Wyattville.
Yeah, 1248 Wren Park.
That-That's it.
Why don't you two come into the den.
We'll open up the sloe gin...
and see what kind of
natural wonders occur?
[Chuckles] I prefer my natural wonders
in national parks. But thank you.
Oh, come on, I just laid
some brand-new shag.
It's three-quarter pile,
extra thick padding.
Makes for some comfy cuddlin'.
- Are you talkin' about the four of us?
- You two swing, don't ya?
- [Broots Chuckles]
- Very tempting, Roy.
However, I could never share this stud
muffin with anyone. Maybe next time.
- [Miss Parker] Buh-bye.
- [Door Opens, Closes]
[Phone Beeping]
Yeah, it's me.
They just left.
Jarod? I heard you went to see
Melissa last night.
- Yes, I did.
- I'm surprised you got in.
Most of the time
she's not even answering the phone.
- How is she?
- She's not doing well.
She's obviously paranoid and she's
exhibiting obsessive-compulsive behavior.
Now I realize she's been traumatized...
but I'm sensing there's something,
something else going on with her.
So, you think there
could be deeper issues at work?
Perhaps. I'm not sure.
I was hoping maybe you could tell me.
Up until all this, Melissa Blass was one of
the most solid, stable people I've ever known.
[Doorbell Rings]
Jarod, please.
I don't want to talk.
I have a delivery this time.
How would you like to take a walk
on the beach?
[Waves Crashing, Seagulls Squawking]
Jarod, this is crazy.
We're shrinks.
Crazy is our business.
I want you to close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Imagine yourself
at your grandmother's beach house.
Remember how safe
you used to feel there.
Hear the surf rolling in and out.
Feel the warm sun on your face.
Nothing bad can ever
happen to you here.
[Melissa's Voice]
And so I walked in.
There was a hand
clamped over my mouth.
Blindfold. Handcuffis.
- Handcuffs. Handcuffs.
- Jarod, I know what you're doing.
I use sensory-relaxation exercises
all the time with my patients.
And you know that they work.
It's very important that we talk about
the night you were attacked.
But I told you everything I could.
I need to know if you
actually saw Luke Carlo.
Did you actually see him?
[Breathing Heavily]
Well, he called me and lured me down there.
But did you see him?
Well, I don't know.
I don't remember. I-
- [Pills Rattling]
- No.
I guess I- I mean I never-
No, I didn't.
But why would anyone else
want me there?
Damn it! Oh!
- Pronil?
- Just a mild sedative.
Dr. Covney filled this?
He handles all the meds
at the clinic.
- Oh, hey, Jarod.
- Dr. Covney.
- Something wrong?
- How often are mistakes made
on prescriptions around here?
- Never. Why?
- Because this was given to a patient...
- in a bottle marked "Pronil."
- Daronex? Well, this is wrong.
This is really wrong.
Pronil's a sedative.
But Daronex- its main side effect
is heightened anxiety.
A steady diet of these will push
just about anybody over the edge.
Then explain to me
why you gave it to Melissa Blass?
Melissa? Now wait a minute.
I did not fill that prescription.
- Your name's on the bottle.
- I'm the one with the med permit.
My name is on all the labels.
But I didn't fill that one. Dr. Arnett did.
He takes care of
Melissa's meds personally.
But I can't believe
he'd make a mistake like that.
Neither can I.
We tried what you suggested,
Dr. Kinsey.
Making love at home, behind closed doors,
in your own bedroom.
Yeah. It was good.
Unfortunately, I got a little out
of control. I couldn't help myself.
- I opened the curtains.
- And then it got great.
We had no idea we had so many
nice neighbors in our apartment complex.
It's reallya shame
we're gonna have to move now.
Give me an "S"! "S"!
Give me an "E"! "E"!
Give me an "X"! "X"!
Sex!
[Giggles]
Thank you, Monique.
Please put your clothes on.
Well, this is the address we got
from that lustyfun.com couple.
It's not the nicest place
Jarod's ever lived.
Better than swinger's central.
Come here.
Yeah. Give me a boost.
- Broots?
- Oh, yeah, okay, right.
One. Two. Three.
- Broots!
- Oh, yeah, okay.
[Clattering]
Damn it!
I'm so tired of being late for the party.
Shh. Miss Parker,
we might not be late this time.
Look at all this stuff.
Today's paper.
Food, clothes, a D.S.A. player.
This computer's still warm.
Jarod's still living here.
This is too important
not to tell Mr. Lyle.
Don't you think this is important enough
that we have to let him know?
Sorry. I-I get hungry
when I'm nervous.
- Pistachio?
- Broots, when exactly...
did we find that receipt
in the box from Jarod's lair?
Right after Mr. Lyle left.
- We're out of here.
- What?
Why? Wait. Miss Parker?
Wait, don't leave me here.
[Melissa]
I can't believe the difference.
I already feel so much clearer.
I should've known something was wrong
with those other pills.
How could you?
They both look exactly alike...
and with what the Daronex
was doing to your mind.
Melissa? I think it's time
that we had a real talk...
about what happened toyou.
Look, you can put locks on your doors,
you can put bars on your windows.
But they can't keep out
the fear inside of you.
Yeah, but I already told you
everything I could.
The rest just isn't there.
Then let's go further back...
to the first time
you were attacked.
- How did you know?
- Call it... a doctor's hunch.
[Chuckles]
It was back in college.
You went to Marrietta University
with Dr. Arnett.
Yeah.
I was, uh, coming home
late one night after studying.
[Sniffles]
[Sighs]
I was, uh, passing by
one of the old dorms.
A man in a mask
jumped out of the shadows...
grabbed me and pulled me inside.
They never even caught him.
But you bounced back.
Yeah, I did. I really did.
I got counseling, I-I worked
really hard to become me again.
But always in the back of my mind...
part of me is just... shattered.
I don't know if I can
bounce back this time.
No. No more crutch.
It's time to figure out what really
happened downtown that night.
But how, Jarod?
By asking someone who knows.
Luke, I want you to just imagine
somewhere very peaceful.
It's very safe.
- Tell me what you're seeing.
- Trees.
Lots of green grass.
That's a-a park I go to sometimes,
not far from here.
There's a-a bench I like to sit on.
I look up at the clouds.
- Are you hearing anything?
- Music.
There's a-a guy who's always there...
and he brings his cello.
[Sighs]
It's really soothing...
sitting on the bench...
just listening to the cello.
# [Cello]
You were right, Luke.
It is relaxing here.
- What the hell?
- You can run all you want.
But your guilty conscience
will be tapping you
on the shoulder wherever you go.
Look, I told you.
I'm not guilty of nothin'.
I didn't attack Dr. Blass.
I know. But someone made you
lure her to that hotel room.
Why?
Dr. Arnett attacked her,
didn't he?
I didn't wanna call her.
I like Dr. Blass.
She was the first person
who really seemed to care about me.
But one night, after a session...
Arnett grabbed me.
He told me he'd make me a deal.
He said that if I got her to the hotel,
he wouldn't report me.
I was, like, report me for what?
Missed appointments. Probation violations.
Whatever he could make up.
He said sending a deviant
like me back to prison was easy.
So either I called or he did.
The next day, when I heard...
I was, like-
I felt like I was gonna puke.
Dr. Blass always said...
"Recovery is a long road."
But one step at a time...
will get you there.
And I was taking those steps.
I was getting better, thanks to her.
Why didn't you come forward?
My word versus Arnett's?
A lowlife like me
against the respected doctor?
No one will ever lay a finger on him.
Don't bet on it.
Jarod. You're working late.
Yes. I have a case that's
starting to trouble me.
Anything I can help you with?
Maybe you can.
Being that you have such an insight...
into the mind of sexual predators.
You see, I'm having trouble
understanding his motivation.
Well, you know, Jarod,
it's control.
Sex may be the avenue they choose...
but the underlying motivation-
it's always control.
To get it, he puts his victim down.
He debases their humanity.
It's the only way the predator
can convince himself he's worthy.
And if he refuses to seek treatment?
Without admission of responsibility...
there's very little hope
for improvement.
Then I guess I'd better find
a more radical form of therapy.
Thank you for your... insight.
Everyone has fears.
To this day, I'm hydrophobic.
So, Monique, you wanna play dress-up?
Really?
[Door Closes]
Melissa?
Melissa, is that you?
Melissa, I didn't know
you were out of the house these days.
Monique?
[Groans]
- Jarod.
- Just a B-12 shot, Dr. Arnett.
Whoops. It's a sedative.
Don't you just hate it
when medications get switched?
# [Whistling]
[Gasps]
- Jarod?
- Relax, Doctor.
You're strapped down
and going nowhere.
Welcome to the Eros Inn, Doc.
Oh, that's right.
You've been here before.
What the hell are you doing?
Just tryin' to help you relax.
And what's more relaxing
than a nice, warm bath.
- No, no! No, don't! Don't, don't, don't!
- That's right. Hydrophobia.
You really should see
a therapist about that.
Jarod, you're crazy.
What'd I ever do to you?
Oh, it's not what you did to me.
It's what you did to Melissa Blass.
You're out of your mind.
Everybody knows Luke Carlo attacked her.
Not everyone.
Allow me to float my theory.
[Gasps]
Damn it,Jarod! You can't do this!
It's all about control.
Like back when you were in college,
when you were a Mighty Bobcat.
The way you took control
over those four innocent girls.
You don't know what
you're talkin' about.
I may not have all the details,
but I do have the broad strokes.
Oh, speaking of strokes?
Do you know yours? Breaststroke. Backstroke?
'Cause you're going to need them
the way this water level's rising.
- I swear!
- Now you know how Melissa felt.
Powerless. Drowning
in her very worst fear.
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you did it to her!
Jarod, no!
Please don't!
It was her fault! I put her down
12 years ago! She should've stayed down!
But she didn't! She wouldn't let
what you did to her destroy her!
- She kept rubbing it in my face.
- Then you tried to ruin her for good.
From the day you hired her at the clinic,
every day since then...
you've been planning
her second assault.
She had to learn her lesson!
Now it's time that you learn yours.
She had to learn her lesson!
[Gasping]
[Water Off]
Like you said, Doc,
everyone has fears.
[Whimpering]
Miss Parker,
I was starting to worry.
I hadn't heard any developments
in your Jarod pursuit.
That's because there was no Jarod pursuit,
was there, Lyle?
It was all just a setup.
The bogus shipping report...
the fake lair with all the sex toys.
The swinging couple, however,
was a very cute touch.
You don't usually show so much imagination
when trying to screw me over.
I don't have the foggiest idea
what you're talking about.
Next time, do your homework.
Jarod's allergic to pistachios.
- [Broots] God, she's amazing.
- Go on, tell her.
No, Syd. Women don't wanna be told.
They wanna be shown.
It's time I make my move.
Broots, I'm flattered.
In fact, it's kind of sweet.
But it's never gonna happen.
Good luck with
the chinny-chin-chin.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Oh, that sun feels nice.
[Sighs]
Well, it's a start, huh?
Today the porch,
tomorrow the world.
Melissa, there's a lot
of people who miss you...
who want- who need your help.
Well, I'm sure helping them...
will be the best therapy for me.
One step at a time
is the best therapy.
Jarod, thank you.
Good luck.

[Clucking]
[Broots] Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop!
Right here.
This is it.
Nice job, Broots.
Can you even spell "map"?
No, we're not lost, Miss Parker.
The G.P.S. coordinates Jarod gave us...
say it's right around here.
About, uh, 25 yards...
that way!
This should be it.
This-This should be it, right here.
- This is it! This is it!
- All right!
I'm way past the point of losing patience
with Jarod's little games.
This is a waste of time.
If he brought us here,
there must be a reason.
Yeah. To make us feel like asses
traipsing around Kansas all day.
Well, uh, actually, Miss Parker,
I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.
- What'd you say?
- Well, based on this map...
we just crossed the state line
right there.
No. Exactly what did you just say?
I said, "I don't think
we're in Kansas anymore."
What's that there?
A brick. Ayellow brick...
with an address on it.
- I get it. Follow the yellow brick road.
- Very good, Broots.
- I love that story.
- Either of you munchkins...
break into song,
I'll drop a house on ya.
Let's go find out what our
little flying monkey is up to.
Well, I see that
the slop on a shingle...
seemed to work out all right after all.
I am sorry about the misunderstanding.
But with the name and all, well...
I thought it had something to do
with the biological function of a pig.
I'm just kinda glad that I didn't
suggest the red-eyed gravy.
[Laughing]
Oh. Oh.
- Do you have a restroom?
- For customers only.
I'll take a doughnut.
- Excuse me. Is everything all right?
- Yeah. Peachy.
- I mean, if there's something I can do?
- Damn it!
Thanks.
-It was just a kiss, sweetheart.
-Maybe I can help you.
- Getting out of the way would be a start.
- That guy didn't seem friendly.
You're a great kisser, but if you don't
shut the door, I'm gonna have to hurt you.
Shut the door!
There. It's shut.
[Sighs]
Not what I had in mind...
but we're gonna have to go with it.
- [Grunts]
- [Horn Honking]
He's wearing a badge.
You're on the run from the police?
Nah, we're on the run from the police.
How's it feel to be a wanted man?
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because ofwhat I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
[Miss Parker]
He defends the weak and abused.
Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
You could have told me you were
on the run from the police.
I don't remember beggin' you
to get in the car.
I thought you needed help.
I appreciate the whole Dudley Do-Right thing,
but you're a little out of your league.
What are you?
Insurance, banker, what?
- Stock analyst. At least I was.
- Uh-huh.
Family man, too, I bet.
A couple of kids, a pretty little wife.
Drive 'em to soccer practice
in the S.U.V.
The best thing you can do
is turn yourself in.
Look, you can relax, all right?
I'm not on the run from the cops.
I'm on the run from a cop.
Singular.
That charming guy back at
the diner was Vince, my ex-boyfriend.
He's not takin' the breakup real well.
You're trying to tell me that
that cop was in love with you?
What can I say?
I'm a hell of a catch.
- Where are you headed?
- Nowhere. Anywhere.
Somewhere's right up the road.
Drop you off?
I suppose we'd probably wig out
the wife if l drove up to your front door.
Well, I don't have a wife.
A home either, for that matter.
- Where you headed?
- Nowhere.
Anywhere.
I already been somewhere.
Well, I'm going east,
so I guess that's where we're headed.
You can ride if you want to.
It might be nice if l
knew your name, though.
- Jarod.
- Nice to meet you,Jarod.
I'm Zoe.
You're sure this is the place, Broots?
Well, the address matches the brick.
Is it me, or has Oz
been seriously rezoned?
[Distant Train Horn Blaring]
- Yeah?
- Hi. We're looking for...
who the hell knows.
- Jarod sent us.
- Oh. You must be Dorothy.
- Hold on a minute.
- If she's Dorothy...
that makes us, what,
the Lion and the Tin Man?
You're Toto at best, Broots.
- Hello?
- Down here.
- Don't tell me. You represent-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just get inside before I air-condition
the whole damn world.
I guess the Wizard forgot
to pay the light bill.
Here. Here.
You know what to do.
Follow, follow, follow, follow.
- It just keeps getting better.
- [Lock Clicking]
- Hey! Open up the door!
- Not without the magic words!
Parker, I'm sure we'll get out of here
when Jarod intends us to.
[Sighs] If I only had a brain.
Come on.
[Kids Chattering]
- Lemonade, 50 cents.
- [Zoe] Check it out.
- God, how many times did we
do that when we were kids?
- Lemonade, 50 cents.
- They're awfully young to be running
a business.
- It's a lemonade stand.
Are you telling me you
and your friends never did that?
- Every kid does that.
- Not every kid.
Lemonade.
- Hey, guys. How's business?
- Not so good.
Maybe your luck is changing. My friend
and I have been driving for a while...
and we're really thirsty.
- Isn't that right, Jarod?
- Oh, yeah.
We're parched.
How much?
Fifty cents a glass.
Oh, we're a lot thirstier than that.
- We might need the whole pitcher.
- Mm-hmm.
You think that'll cover it?
[Girls]
Mom!
- Mother! Mom!
- Two hundred dollars?
I just remember when my
sister Katie and I used to do this.
We'd start out dreamin' we'd make
a ton of money, and, of course,
that would never happen.
I guess I just wanted to see
what a dream come true looks like.
Sounds like you had a good childhood.
Yeah.
About a million years ago.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
[Coughs] Of course, when we made it,
we actually put sugar in it.
Mmm.
I think it's perfect.
Jarod, you scare me.
- You comin'?
- Yes.
# [Man Singing On Radio]
# [Singing Along With Radio]
- Sing it!
- I don't know it.
- Hey, there's a tape case in the back.
- # [Off]
Grab somethin' that looks good.
You don't know it?
[Laughs]
# [Singing]
This looks interesting.
You want to tell me about it?
What's to tell?
I don't like writin' out checks.
- That's not a crime, is it?
- Come on. A box full of cash?
- That cop back at the diner?
- I already told you about him.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
What'd you do, rob a bank?
You know, screw you,Jarod.
The only thing I'm guilty of...
is staying too long
in a lousy relationship.
- Oh, with the cop, right?
- That's right.
Except Vince didn't know how to leave
the authority figure thing at home...
so for two years, I put up with him
beatin' the crap out of me.
It might be two years too late,
but at least I finally walked out.
This is every bit of savings I had.
[Sighs]
So there.
That's my happy little tale.
I'm 30 years old, and my whole life
is two suitcases...
$27,000 and a '62 Ford.
I kinda missed out
on happily ever after.
Zoe, I'm sorry.
You know, whatever.
Look, it's been real fun,
but when we reach the next town...
I'll drop you off
where you can catch a bus.
[Bell Dings]
- Fill her up?
- Yes, please.
Can I help you?
Yes. When does the next bus
come through here?
Oh, uh, hold on a second.
I got a schedule here some place.
Twenty-one to Dispatch.
Possible on female A.P.B. out of
Warrington. Pennsylvania plates.
Edward-Baker-David-6233.
[Woman On Radio] Roger, 21. Suspect
wanted for assault and armed robbery.
Apprehend with caution.
Howdy, ma'am.
License and registration, please.
[Zoe]
Yeah.
Well, you've either got
real good luck or real bad.
- The next westbound doesn't
get here till 7:45 tonight.
- [Zoe, Indistinct]
But if you're headed eastbound,
well, here comes the 1:30 right now.
[Man] Pretty little thing.
I wonder what she did to deserve that.
- Me too.
- [Car Door Closes]
- So, am I gonna sell you a ticket?
- [Engine Starts]
No. My plans have changed.
[Sighs]
Come on.
You're being jerked around.
I didn't steal anything from anyone.
Ma'am, we got an A.P.B.
on the police wire.
If it's a mistake, you can
clear it up back in Warrington.
I won't get back to Warrington.
Haven't you heard anything I've just said?
- Your ride should be here any minute.
- It's, uh, here now.
Jarod Malloy, Warrington P.D.
Oh, I see you got my perp here.
Malloy? I was told an Officer Hudono
was comin' to get her.
Oh, yeah. Vince.
He smacked into...
the chief's brand new Lexus
on the way out of the parking lot.
- Ow.
- He's gonna be patchin' up
his butt for a while...
so I'm, uh- I'm coverin' for him.
I just want to go home.
You got your PP-3 form?
Uh- Uh- Uh-
Damn it! No, I must have
left it in Vince's car.
We really can't release her
without it.
[Tires Screeching]
Can you help me out here? It's my
daughter's 10th birthday party tonight.
I really want
to get back in time for it.
Why don't you let me take my perp,
and then I'll fax you back the PP-3 form?
[Car Door Closes]
Yeah, well, allright. I don't want you
to miss your daughter's party.
Thanks.
I owe you one.
- Hey, where you goin'?
- I parked out back.
[Door Opens, Closes]
That is absolutely the most incredible
thing anyone's ever done for me.
Vince is coming through
the front door. Get in the car.
You have my car, my money. You could
have taken everything and disappeared.
How did you know I was telling
the truth about Vince?
I could've made that stuff up.
Jarod!
- How did you know?
- Because you told me.
Now get in the car.
You're a fugitive now.
Drive, cowboy!
Hey! Hey, Zoe!
Jarod, I think it's time
you tell me the truth.
- The truth about what?
- You're obviously not a stock analyst.
You make a pretty convincing cop,
but that's not it either.
So, who are you really?
I'm just someone who's looking for
a little happily ever after myself.
I'm searching for my family. I got
separated from them when I was a kid.
I'm separated from my family too.
By choice. I ran away when I was 1 6.
I can't imagine having a family
and not wanting to be with them.
- Don't you miss them?
- My grandmother, I do a lot.
She's the only one who
ever really understood me.
But the others?
I don't really think about them.
Except, of course, my sister Katie.
Let me tell you something
about identical twins.
They're not.
Katie got all the brains...
the talent, the sense ofhumor.
No one ever had any trouble
telling us apart.
There. That should keep Vince
off our backs.
The state line is about
an hour east ofhere.
After that, you'll be free and clear.
We're not gonna go east anymore.
A new plan.
We're goin' north.
- To where?
- I'm gonna teach you...
about another childhood staple
I'm pretty sure you missed out on.
- The road trip.
- The road trip?
Yeah. Distilled to
its most basic essence...
it is loading up on junk food...
crankin' the radio and...
just drivin'.
# [Man Singing On Radio]
# [Continues]
# [Ends]
[Miss Parker]
Okay, joke's over.
What the hell are we supposed
to be finding?
Maybe Jarod wants us to run
like rats in a maze.
Oh, yeah.
Or a fun house.
That would imply having fun.
What's that light down there?
Great. We go on
the yellow brick road death march...
and all we find is
this Goodwill reject?
Hey, that's G.I. Joe.
One of your "don't ask,
don't tell" buddies?
I had one just like this
when I was a kid.
He had the same jungle fatigues,
the same fake scar.
- Oh.
- [Sydney] What is it?
There's a letter "B" carved in the boot.
But mine had a "B."
I carved it with
Kenny Golletti's pocket knife.
- [Sydney] You're saying this is your doll?
- It couldn't be.
- Could it?
- We have entered the Jarod Zone.
G.I. Joe was my best friend.
When I was 12, I got the measles.
I spent all summer in the hospital.
I almost died.
You know, none of my friends
could visit me.
And then my brother,
he snuck me in my G.I. Joe.
And it reminded me of home,
of my room...
where everything was so much better.
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy...
but this little guy
saved my life that summer.
You never mentioned this story
before, Broots.
Well, I never even thought of it before.
- Until-
- Till Jarod reminded you.
[Sighs] What do you think?
Too ick?
Not ick at all.
You look beautiful.
- Why the change?
- Mmm.
Would, uh, you bewilling
to pretend for me again?
Okay, okay. Anytime you want
to fill me in on what's going on here-
Zoe! Oh,
I can't believe it's you!
- Hi, Grandma.
- Oh, sweetie, it's so good to see you!
I can't tell you the time I've spent worrying
that somethin' might have happened to you.
Something has happened to me.
There's someone I want you to meet.
- This is Jarod.
- Hi.
- My husband. You're gonna love him, Grandma.
- [Laughing]
He's sweet and kind and spoils
me almost as much as you used to.
Oh, well, you picked a perfect
time to surprise me.
Your sister Linda
and her husband are here.
Come on in and share the good news.
Let's go share the good news, honey.
Linda, you'll never guess who's here.
Your baby sister, and she's a newlywed.
- Hey, Linda.
- Wow. Well, that's... great.
Um, congratulations.
Uh- Uh, Linda is my sister.
And, uh, this is-
That's my husband, Greg.
Zoe should know that,
but since she couldn't be bothered...
to come to our wedding,
they've never met.
[Mouths Word]
Who wants coffee?
[Linda]
I'm not sure if you care...
but Mom's still chairing
the ladies' group at the club...
and, uh, Mark and his wife
just had their second boy in June.
- Mark's our brother.
- I swear, he hasn't had a minute to rest.
He's taken over the firm from Dad.
It's been such a success.
They must have 20 partners now.
- So, what do you do, Jarod?
- Hmm?
Uh, a little bit of this,
a little bit of that.
Oh, don't be so modest, honey.
Jarod's an aerospace engineer.
He designs commercial jetliners.
Small world. I run the F.A.A.'s...
propulsion research facility
in Red Valley.
What do you make of these new 6250s
comin' out of Northum?
Well, they'll look a lot better
after they sort out their preignition
wire bus problems.
The S.Q. gyro platforms
tend to shimmy at high R.P.M.s...
which could throw off
the whole telemetry.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
I hadn't heard anything about it.
- He's really something.
- Yeah, he sure is.
[Miss Parker]
He's a jerk, and this proves it.
I'm tellin' you right now,
if that thing starts playing...
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"
I"m gonna blow it into a million pieces.
Now, don't. Wait.
[Chuckles]
It's a French song
from the early '40s.
- "Les Mots D"Amour."
- "The Language of Love."
It was yours, huh, Syd?
# [Record]
When the Allies liberated our camp...
my brother Jacob and I had to make
our way back home to Lyon.
- When we got home, the house
my father built by hand...
- # [Woman Singing In French]
was reduced to mere rubble.
But in the debris,
we found this record.
It was my mother's favorite song.
She would put it on and make
my father dance with her.
And my brother Jacob and I
would have to watch them.
I thought I had lost it years ago.
Sydney, what do you think Jarod
is trying to tell us with all of this?
I don't know.
But I'm glad he is.
Four children, 12 grandchildren
and 10 great-grandkids.
- I'd say I'm blessed, wouldn't you?
- I'd say.
Is this Zoe with Katie?
Oh, this is one of my favorites.
And this was taken just a few weeks
before, uh, Katie died.
It was almost like they both
died on the same day.
You know, it hit everybody pretty hard.
But Zoe, she was devastated.
I can imagine.
Her twin sister.
In time, the rest of
the family managed to go on.
But I think she resented them,
like they were forgetting about Katie.
Zoe just sort of spiraled
after that, pullin' away from the family.
- That's when Zoe ran away.
- Mm m.
I have a feeling now I can worry less.
- What are you two gossiping about?
- Oh, none of your business. Shh.
- You sleep tight.
- Good night.
And I'll see you in the morning.
[Chuckles]
We did it!
We pulled it off! [Laughs]
Oh, and, Jarod,
that whole airline engine thing?
Perfect.
Thank you so much.
Why is it so important that they think
your life is something that it's not?
You don't understand.
I have always been the family screwup.
No direction, no decent job.
Lousy relationships.
Look at my brothers and sisters.
All success stories.
- Well, who cares what they think?
- I don't.
But my grandmother-
I want her to think that...
I've turned my life around-
that I'm happy.
Even if it is a lie.
It'll be easier for her that way.
- What do you mean by that?
- Nothing.
Hey, I know how we can really
convince them that we're newlyweds.
[Meows]
Stick around.
- What is it?
- How long have you known you were sick?
- How'd you know I was sick?
- These prescriptions...
are all precursors for chemotherapy.
How long have you known?
I don't know.
Three weeks.
And you haven't filled
the prescriptions yet. Zoe-
- I haven't gotten around to it.
- This is serious.
Your carefree attitude
won't make it go away.
What do you want from me,
some scene out of Love Story?
Sorry. Drama queen's not my style.
- I'm going to the drugstore tomorrow.
- You don't have to do that.
- I want to.
- I don't want you to.
Jarod, I've seen people fight
this type of cancer before.
All the agony and sickness.
The cure's worse than the disease.
- Besides, most of them die anyway.
- There are new treatments-
advancements that could
give you a real chance.
- So now you're a doctor too?
- I'm just saying it doesn't
have to be a fatal condition.
Life is a fatal condition.
You get off the bus, suck all the juice
out of the years you have...
and it's... good night, Cleveland.
You've been a beautiful crowd.
Those are the rules.
Always have been.
I get it.
And I'm not gonna cry and plead for special
treatment just as the curtain's closing.
You know, it's weird, but in some ways,
it's been a good thing.
It made me realize I had
to get away from Vince.
Brought me here to see
my grandmother again.
Even brought me to you.
You can't give up without a fight.
Yes, I can.
Jarod, don't say anything...
about this to anyone,
especially my grandmother.
- Zoe-
- Promise me?
- [Scoffs] I can't accept this.
- You have to. This is my life.
These are my decisions.
Besides, maybe I deserve it.
Jarod?
I vote we go back to the Munchkin and
shoot our way out of this madhouse.
This journey isn't over till we find
what Jarod left for you, Miss Parker.
And I think we just found it.
This looks like the basket
that Dorothy carried Toto in.
Well, if Jarod rustled up
my old dog Mr. Sheckle...
it ain't gonna be pretty.
- A thimble?
- [Broots] Miss Parker?
My family...
didn't spend a lot of time
together when I was growing up.
My father was always at the Centre.
If he was around, my mother
was off in an orphanage somewhere.
But one day...
there had been a bigstorm.
But the roads were all closed.
Everything was shut down.
[Chuckles]
Daddy, of course, was annoyed.
But I was elated,
because it was just the three ofus...
trapped together in the house.
So, you all just sewed something.
[Chuckling]
[Chuckling]
- We played Monopoly.
- Oh.
We played Monopoly all day
and into the night.
Daddy was the shoe,
my mother was the car, and I was...
the thimble.
[Clears Throat] So, why do you suppose
Jarod is doing this?
I mean, what do you-
What do you think he's trying to say?
- There's no place like home.
- There's no place like home.
Which is how we get
the hell out ofhere.
Okay, let me hear it one more time!
- There's no place-
- We've said it three times already!
I know, but I gotta hear it
with the shoes clicking.
You're gonna hear it with the clicking
of my .9 millimeter...
if you don't open the damn door!
[Lock Clicking]
Hey, nice attitude!
Don't forget to come back...
and see me next time
you're in the Emerald City, huh?
- I really wish you weren't leavin' so soon.
- So do I.
But Jarod's speaking at
a big conference up north.
And if we don't leave now,
well, he's gonna be late.
Well, don't you keep my little girl
away too long, Jarod.
I want to see her back here soon.
Oh, she'll be back before you know it.
Oh, one more thing, Gram.
I have something for you.
A, uh- A surprise birthday present.
- But my birthday isn't for two months.
- That's why it's a surprise.
But don't open it until after we leave.
- I love you.
- I love you, Zoe.
Oh, I love you.
[Grunts]
Bye.
Thank you, Jarod,
for keeping your promise.
I still think you should tell her.
Better she remember me like this.
Driving away one last time?
No. Happy.
And I'd really appreciate it
if you'd be happy too.
You know, enough of this morose crap.
I plan on making the most
of my time that's left.
[Man On Radio] And by the way,
if you're out near Freeburg today...
the local "Y""
is putting on a carnival.
- They"re gonna have games, rides.
Bring the whole family down.
- Come on, Jarod.
- Show me a good time.
- [Radio] You'll have lots of fun-
[Door Opening]
It's not home, but it'll do.
[Sydney] Looks like the next piece
of Jarod's puzzle's already here.
[Broots]
The Wicked Witch of the West.
Hey, doesn't it kind of
look a little... Iike-
I'll take that as a compliment.
There must be more than
the obvious interpretation.
Maybe some deeper meaning?
Hmm?
[Evil Laughter, Sizzling]
[Laughter Continues]
[Warped Laughter]
[Laughter Stops]
Hey, look.
Broots, call the airstrip.
Tell them to get my broomstick fired up.
We're goin' back to Kansas.
[Zoe] The manager said
our room is around here.
You're amazing, Jarod.
I've never seen someone...
win one game after another like that.
It's really very simple.
It's all a matter of geometry and physics.
- Right.
- Okay, I worked a stint
as a carny a while back.
- I know all their secrets.
- Now, why doesn't that surprise me?
[Both Chuckling]
He gave us lucky number seven.
Where are you going now?
- Zoe?
- It's magical, Jarod.
Don't you feel like takin' a dip?
- Come on.
- Zoe, no.
Jarod, yes. Look at it.
It's calling us.
- I don't have a bathing suit.
- Neither do I.
- I don't know.
- Hey, I paid for the room.
- The least you can do is swim with me.
- [Sighs]
You've never skinny-dipped
before, have you?
Is- Is that what they call it?
Yeah. Jump in and I'll show you why.
- You're crazy, you know that?
- And you're stalling.
Just what does a naked woman
have to do to get you in here?
[Splashing]
- It's not so bad, is it?
- Nice.
It's pretty good.
Hi.
Hi.
Mmm. Zoe?
- [Chuckles] Okay, what are you doing?
- Last night was amazing.
- Mmm.
- The last 48 hours have been amazing.
Falling in love wasn't part of the plan.
- What plan?
- The one that says I have to go now,
and it has to be alone.
What? What are you doing?
This isn't funny.
Unlock these cuffs.
- Unlock the cuffs! Give me the key!
- I can't.
Look, you're going to get well.
You'll beat this!
No, I won't!
I'm sure of that.
I need to end things my way.
Go out with a bang, right?
- Zoe, don't do this.
- Jarod, you're good at pretending.
- Just pretend you never met me.
- Zoe! Zoe-
- Zoe!
- [Door Closes]
[Grunting]
Hi, honey.
Goin' somewhere?
- The game's over. It's time to go home.
- That's not my home anymore.
- I told you, you and I are over.
- If you didn't want me to find you...
then you wouldn't have
used your credit card to rent the room.
- You haven't blown all that money?
- The money was mine!
- It was ours!
- Fine. You know what?
- You can have it, but you can't have me!
- You really wanna take me on?
- Do you?
- I will if l have to.
- What the hell? You're with this guy?
- Come on, Zoe. It's all right.
- Hey!
- Look, she doesn't wanna be with you.
- Why can't you get that through your head?
- That's not her decision.
And it's not yours either.
Let's go.
- Oh, my God, Vince, no!
- You must've had some fun last night, huh?
I'll tell you what. Not like the fun
you and I are gonna have tonight.
[Grunting]
Vince, don't!
Son of a bitch!
You got some brass ones!
I'll give you that!
[Engine Starts]
- [Tires Screeching]
- Zoe! Zoe!
Zoe?
How'd you know?
I called your grandmother.
She said this is where your sister died.
- Please, I want to talk to you.
- Oh, no, you don't.
You want to stop me
from finishing my journey.
Zoe, what happened was terrible,
and it was very sad...
but it was an accident.
You have to stop
blaming yourself for it.
I'm the one who told her
to climb up here.
I only meant it as a joke, but Katie,
she never turned down a dare.
She was right about here
when she slipped.
Katie should have been the one
that lived. She was smarter, funnier.
So you think you deserve to die.
Is that it?
It's not like I've been
a big success in life.
Look at what I've done to mine.
I've made a mess of it.
Because you've been punishing yourself
for what happened to your sister...
and that's why you're
not fighting the cancer.
This isn't about living life
to the fullest...
or going out with a bang.
You're not fighting it because you
don't think you deserve to beat it.
God, Jarod.
- I'm just so scared.
- I know you are.
And I'm going to help you.
But there's only one place to do it...
and that's with the people you love.
Why would Jarod bring us
all the way back here...
when nothing has changed?
Well, nothing except this.
It's not exactly ruby slippers.
I think Jarod fell asleep in
the magical poppies a little too long.
[Broots] A note from Jarod, Sydney?
What does it say?
- "There's no place like home."
- In case we didn't get it before?
"Everyone deserves one.
So why don't you...
leave me alone
and let me find mine?"
[Kid Laughing, Chattering]
Hey-hey-hey!
[Chattering, Indistinct]
Areyou sure about this?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- You got a long fight ahead of you.
I don't want you to have to
go through it alone.
I'm not alone.
I've got them.
And I've got you.
- In here.
- I want to stay with you.
I know.
But you can't stay, can you?
I can see it in your eyes.
Thank you... for helping me
find my way back home.
Good-bye.
You ever say that word again,
I'll kick your butt.
- Okay.
- Go.
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
All right, could it be behind
door number one, two or three?
And you have first choice right now,
Kathy. What door do you want?
- [Kathy] Three.
- Door number three.
And, Debbie?
Debbie, just for the fun of it-
Just for the fun of it, which one would
you have chosen if you went for it?
- [Debbie] Two.
- Number two. What was behind number two?
Just two- $2, 000 in cash...
because the super deal
was behind... number one!
And number three had the $1,000.
- [Knocking]
- [Woman] Ready to take the plunge?
Ready.
It's my "big deal of the day."
[Man]
Jarod must've screwed up bad...
if they sent three of ya out here
to close him down.
You sure that you're his
Amway field representatives?
Do you really think that we could
fool someone as smart as yourself?
Well, uh, I-I guess
it's that Amway thing.
Uh, I just never thought of Jarod
as a glycerin and honey soap kind of guy.
That is what you people sell,
isn't it? Soap?
Yeah, uh, everything
from, uh, baby shampoo...
to, uh, industrial-strength
pool cleaner.
That'd be good foryou.
Oh, look.
The Match Game, the home version.
Uh,Jarod, he's a-
he's a regular lightning round lunatic.
When he's not surfin' the waves,
he's surfin' the Game Show Channel.
Parker?
Pushing the Limits.
Taking Risks.
Confessions of an Adrenaline Junkie.
What are we talkin' about here, Syd?
Jarod Knievel jumping Buicks at Caesars?
It's daredevil stuff, you know?
He's always doing dangerous things...
Iike night surfing
and street luge and-
He even strapped that bullet proof vest
on once and he had me shoot him blindfolded!
All manifestations of
an obsession with risk-taking.
What kind of training do you put
your sales people through, actually?
We'll send you a brochure.
Dr. Quackenbush...
once again, your diagnosis
has come too late to find Jarod.
Well, not that late.
He left less than an hour ago.
Was that with or without
his blindfold?
You don't need a blindfold
to jump off a bridge.
[Woman] You sure you want
to stay with this old cord, Jarod?
You've done 295 on this one.
Well, I only really need it to last 296.
[Yelling]
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
[Miss Parker]
He defends the weak and abused.
[Jarod]
Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
Mr. Goltz's M.R.I. reveals
a closed fracture...
of the right parietal bone
with a subdural hematoma.
[Man]
We've inserted a C.S.F.. shunt...
so we should know more
once his edema's resolved.
I notice on his admission chart
the presence of glass fragments in his hair.
[Man] It's a mystery.
I assumed they came from his glasses.
But his mother says
Tony doesn't wear them.
- Could it have been a sports goggle of some kind?
- No. Industrial-grade glass.
I, uh, did a lab analysis myself.
You did it, not the police?
[Man] They're treating the entire
Goltz case as a bungee stunt gone bad.
Open and shut.
No more, no less.
Tony? Honey, come on back home.
Your sister and I miss you so.
I always keep my family close too.
Sorry. You must be Dr. Nichols.
- Call me Jarod.
- Oh, please, sit down.
When Tony wakes up,
I just want him to remember.
Actually, I didn't think
I'd ever see these photos again.
I thought Tony's wallet
had been lost in the accident...
but somebody found it
at the nurses' station this morning.
It was left in that envelope
wrapped in wax paper.
Well, at least the pictures
were still there.
His sister Carrie took those
at his last birthday.
A week later, he was off
looking for his dad.
He was searching for his father?
His father rode off on a dirt bike
in '91 and never looked back.
Searching for your family.
It's instinct.
Now his- his sister Carrie's doing it.
Not long after we came out here
to look after Tony, she just took off.
I'm just hoping that someday, we'll all
be smiling like in those pictures again.
The best therapy for him is to hear
the voice of his family and his friends.
I guess that's just me now. His friends
used to come by and visit, but they stopped.
- Where are they?
- I don't know.
He and his daredevil friend Zed...
used to ride motorcycles
out at a place called Willow Ridge.
I guess Zed's riding alone now.
# [Rock, Indistinct]
- [Honking]
- [Tires Screeching]
You okay?
Hey, no problem.
I always wanted to be a hood ornament.
I'll take that as a "yes."
You know, the way you flew up
my tailpipe, I thought you were a cop.
Not today.
Are you sure you're all right?
No, it's okay.
The chick can handle it.
Chicks?
They call me Jarod.
- Friends call me Shay.
- Hmm.
Friends like Zed?
- You know Zed?
- I understand that he
and his friends race this road.
Huh. Well, maybe I was right about you.
Maybe you are a cop.
Just somebody tryin'
to fight the boredom.
Oh, by the way, nice racing.
[Engine Sputtering]
It's not exactly a police escort,
but I have an extra seat.
Ask me, Speed Racer's
kissed the asphalt...
one too many times
without a helmet.
[Sydney]
Could be a psychotic cry for help.
Hi, Sis. So I heard Jarod
never came back to his lair.
Any luck deciphering
his new occupation?
Don't quote me, but I think
he morphed into the human cannonball.
Jarod seems to be exhibiting all the signs of
an obsession with extreme thrill-seeking.
Hmm.
Maybe he's rejuvenating.
Some jump off cliffs,
others seek religion.
I, for one, replenish my soul
by going back to nature.
- Oh.
- What, surprised to find I like to camp?
No. Surprised to find you have a soul.
On that loving note, I'm off
to the wilds for three days.
My office will know how to reach me.
I can die now.
I've seen it all.
[Chuckles]
You wanna bet?
They were just delivered.
Scratch "human cannonball."
- He's freakin' Chuck Barris.
- Well, actually, Monty Hall.
And what exactly is the deal
with Jarod's Big Deal, Broots?
We open door number one
with this key.
- What about the other two?
- Time-locked.
- They'll open at predetermined intervals.
- [Miss Parker] Give me that.
Okay, quizmaster,
what is behind door number one?
[Broots]
Looks like a giant fortune cookie.
[Miss Parker]
It is a giant fortune cookie.
[Broots]
So what's our future hold?
It's not about our future.
It's about the past.
It's a dinner bill
from a few weeks ago.
"The Hidden Truth."
And the waitress was called May Lin.
"The Hidden Truth." Yeah. That's the Chinese
restaurant I pass by on my way here.
- I've never been there.
- Me either. You, Syd?
I don't eat rice.
So what do you think
it means, Miss Parker?
That we need reservations.
[Man]
You lose.
[Shay]
Yo, Zeddie, Jojo, Mackey.
What up, Shay? Where you been,
chillin' on a beach with a coldie?
- Just riding.
- Yeah?
You gonna do that luge in a wet suit?
I've been surfin' today, darlin'.
Jojo?
But I hear that whaling stretch of road in
the Glen's gettin' shut down next week.
- So they're dropping the hill?
- Not soon enough. Name's Zed.
- Jarod.
- He's not some Jehovah's Witness
knockin' on my door, is he?
Well, I've witnessed a lot,
but never Jehovah.
That's good, 'cause I'm broke.
And I haven't seen God.
At least not since I had that awesome
meltdown lugin' a canyon last week, hey, guys?
[Man]
Right on!
- You like to ride, "J"?
- Anything and everything.
What do you do for a living?
Well, I seem to have trouble
holding down a steady job.
I get bored pretty easily.
Ah, boredom.
The endless bowel.
- What about yourself?
- A job here, a job there, you know.
- Whatever keeps Cheerios on the table.
- Amen to that.
He can ride, Zed.
I know since Tony's been out...
- you've been looking for another player.
- Is that right?
- You up for an endorphin fix?
- If it takes more nad than
luging down a canyon, sure.
- Why not?
- Well, if you got 'em, bring 'em along.
Then you tell me.
Come on, mates.
[Zed]
200yards, headon.
Keep your wheels on the double yellow.
In the old days, they used to call this
chicken. I think of it more of a chance...
to, uh, get a grin from the gods.
Let's make them smile.
Let's do it.
I'm damn good, Jarod,
but Zed's great.
Don't blink.
He's cageable.
- Oh!
- Ooh!
Nice one, "J" man.
Not even my mate Tony took me that far.
There's a spot in my tribe
if you want it.
Mmm.
Got nothin' better to do.
You know, I've never seen Zed
take to anybody so fast, Jarod.
Easy come, easy go,
I guess.
- Are you talking about Tony?
- Yeah.
- Who is this guy?
- Tony used to hang with the group
before I got here.
Then he got messed up in a bungee accident
a little over a month ago.
Did his cord break?
Frayed or something while takin' a plunge
off the Parker's Mill Road.
The doctors don't give him
much of a chance.
But, hey, like Zed always says,
first one to 40 alive loses.
"J" man!
I'm really glad you made it tonight.
I don't know if Shay told you,
but Friday nights...
we don't exactly
square dance around the radio.
We like to try new things,
push the envelope.
- Then let's make the gods grin.
- No, no, no.
- Let's make 'em laugh out loud.
- [Man] Whoo!
Free the brain, free the body.
Free the body, free the soul.
And you thought we were goin'
hang glidin' tonight, "J."
Fire walkers in Mauritius learn how
to channel their fears, harness them...
to create a power
that could not be denied.
It's a power free for the taking.
Nothing is free.
I'm startin' to think you're a slave
to the same demons I am, "J."
Without demons, there can be no angels.
F.Y.I.
Basaltic rock.
It's a much better conductor of heat.
If you're going to free your soul,
I say free it.
I guess our Chinese dinner
was officially a zonk last night.
Any results yet on that dinner bill
from the fortune cookie?
Well, my pal Bodie down in Physical
did a rush job for me.
- The geek with cloudy cataracts?
- Yeah.
Have you seen them lately?
It's milkier than a Guernsey.
Says the kids love it on Halloween.
Some zombie thing he does.
- The results, Broots.
- Uh-
The-The only prints on the bill
belong to the waitress.
May, last name, Lin.
The one who quit over a month ago
with no forwarding address?
Like I said, zonk.
Oh, Miss Parker?
Jarod's door number two just opened.
Come see what I found inside.
[Jarod]
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
It's time for another exciting game
of You Don't Have a Clue.
I'm your host, Jarod Winkerdale...
and it's time to see
if you have a clue.
This is no stress disorder, Syd.
It's Chernobyl of the brain.
Today's lucky contestant
is Miss Parker!
She'll have overnight
to figure out her clue.
And if she does, she'll win a trip to
the beautiful Cabins O' Love hideaway...
nestled into the rolling hills
of Thompson, West Virginia.
Don't look at me.
I watch soaps.
Okay, Miss Parker, here's your clue.
The hidden truth may be missing...
but you won't find it
until you claim your prize.
- [Bell Dings]
- "The hidden truth."
- The name of the restaurant.
- "May. May missing."
The waitress May Lin is missing.
"You won't find it
until you claim your prize."
A trip to the beautiful Cabins 0' Love.
Beautiful indeed.
[Tony's Mother's Voice]
Tony's wallet had been lost in the accident...
but somebody found it
at the nurses'station this morning.
It was left in that envelope
wrapped in wax paper.
- Four bucks.
- These are delicious.
Oughta be. Harry's got the dirtiest
dirty water dogs in town.
Four duckies.
My wallet.
- Have you seen my wallet?
- How would I know where it is?
Well, since you have such
a knack for finding wallets...
I thought maybe you knew
where mine was.
Look, when Isaw on the news...
that the guy was in a coma from
that bungee accident, I felt guilty.
- Oh, an honorable thief.
- I didn't rob him. I found it.
- About a month ago in the bushes
when I was sweepin' up glass.
- Industrial-grade glass.
It was on the sidewalk
below that high-rise there.
The morning after the robbery,
a rare coin dealer on the 30th floor.
A bunch of'em zip-lined from that building
through the windows to that one.
You'd have to be crazy
to try a stunt like that.
Or searching for your soul.
[Door Closes]
Jarod, what are you doing?
I was looking for a wrench.
My-My bike's losing compression.
- And you?
- Oh, uh, I thought you were Zed.
Did you take this picture?
No. Before I got here.
- Is that Tony?
- Yeah.
I-I guess. Zed used to talk about him
all the time right after the accident.
More than he does now.
Tony and Zed,
they were really good friends?
Tony was in Zed's inner group.
See, with Zed it's all about
the ultimate thrill...
pushing the envelope, challenging the
people around him to find their true selves.
When he thinks you're ready,
he invites you on the ultimate thrill.
Ultimate thrill, or ultimate test?
- Both, I guess.
- Have you been invited?
- I guess he doesn't think I'm ready yet.
- And Tony?
Was that the ultimate thrill,
or the ultimate test?
I don't know.
If you're not in, you're not in.
Well, I didn't mean to interrupt.
[Forced Chuckle]
I'll see you later.
- So when does all this fun begin?
- Meaning?
Meaning I'm not hanging
around here for my health.
The only people around here who are having
any fun are you and your merry little men.
Well, those merry little men
are special people, Jarod.
People who have proven
themselves, you know?
- Pushed the limits of both mind and body.
- And the law?
Your toys, they weren't exactly
dropped off by Santa Claus, were they?
Like I said, "J," whatever it takes
to put Cheerios on the table.
Do you think you have
what it takes, Jarod?
I don't know.
Why don'tyou be the judge?
It's simple, "J." I dump you
in the water, then I throw in a key.
Object:
Free yourself before you die.
- Zed, this is too far.
- A closed mind is a crippled mind, Shay.
Make fear work for you.
Conquer it.
Jarod knows.
You have to taste death to live life.
Right?
Oh, I almost forgot.
- Can you conquer the fear, "J"?
- You'd be surprised what I can do.
- One minute.
- Give him the key.
He's just gettin' started, my love.
- What are you doing?
- Like the ads say...
helping him be all that he can be.
How about you, Shay?
How far will you push it to be your best?
Ninety seconds.
Two minutes.
No. He don't want help.
2:15.
[Coughs]
Mind conquers body.
Welcome to the other side, "J."
Welcome to the merry men.
May Lin stayed in this cabin here.
Perfect.
I tried to engage May
in some occasional chitchat...
but the little waitress
was a bit stand-offish.
I can't imagine what would make her
uncomfortable around here.
Me neither. But I guess them people
just like to stick to themselves.
What kind of a racist comment
is that?
Oh, no.
I'm not unsophisticated.
I was talking about her gender.
Single woman and such.
You're unattached, aren'tyou?
As unattached as your limbs
are gonna be...
if you keep eyeballing me
like that, Mr. Datsun.
Well, anyhoo...
May Lin up and vamoosed in the middle
of the night, skippin' on her bill.
Left her stuff behind too- three dresses,
four tops, shoes, socks, cosmetics...
and six pair of... little black panties.
Well, I had to inventory it.
- I bet you did.
- Kinda creepy.
Pretty girl like that
just vanishin' and all.
Yeah. Creepy.
A good wrench is hard
to come by, isn't it...
Carrie?
[Chuckles]
How'd you know?
The pain in your eyes when you saw
your brother in this picture.
Tony is your brother.
Your mother is very worried about you.
I'm gonna find out
what happened to Tony.
Now, I know Zed is responsible.
I just can't prove it yet.
Zed is not someone
that you mess with.
Now, he talks a mean game
about life and about death...
but when push comes to shove,
you'll be the one doing the dying.
I'm here to help you.
You're gonna have to trust me.
Tony told me that he met this-
He met this guy named Zed,
who promised to help him find our father.
He said he used to ride
with Dad back in '96.
Tony trusted him.
He believed him.
What happened?
A month ago, the night of
Tony's accident, he called me.
I told him that our mother got a call
from our grandmother...
and they hadn't spoken in years.
She said my father died in '92.
That's way before Zed
claims he knew him.
So Zed was stringing
your brother along.
Tony got really angry, and he said
he was gonna confront Zed.
But I guess he never got the chance.
Maybe he did.
Carrie, you are in way over your head.
I want you to go home
and be with your family.
- I'll find out what really happened
to your brother.
- No!
No way.
All right.
You mess with my family,
you mess with me.
- Carrie, listen to me.
- I don't even know who you are.
I have no idea how you got involved
in this, Jarod, but... I like you.
So don't cross me.
Please?
[Broots]
Find anything at the Cabins O'Love?
Yeah. How to ruin a pair
of Gucci's with red clay.
Yeah, that's funny.
The entire trip was a regular laugh riot...
thanks to Jarod's whacked-out
rendition of Alex Trebek.
It's Monty Hall.
[BuzzerSounds]
No time like the present
to find out just how whacked-out.
What is it?
Something for you to clean up
your theories with.
There's a note.
"Be careful what you dig for."
There's an address on here.
- It's Lyle's address.
- Huh.
Hmm.
Sorry, love. It's up to you.
What do you say?
"J." Same invite stands
for you as it does for Shay.
- Invite?
- Yeah.
Got a juicy little excursion
to the other side planned for tonight.
That is, if you're up to it.
- Anything Jarod can handle, I can too.
- Even death?
As the ancients said...
when the gods created man, they saw death
and saved life for themselves.
I say, since we can't live forever,
let's at least live.
Time to do battle with the gods.
Pass tonight's test...
and there'll be no limit.
[Door Opens, Closes]
You don't have to do this, Carrie.
The name is Shay.
Don't forget it.
Good news, Shay. The owners of the house
aren't home, makin' your job easier.
There's a set of blueprints
in the desk in the office.
Bring them to me,
win valuable prizes.
You want me to rob the house?
This is not about stealin', love.
This is about pushin' the envelope.
- She's not ready.
- I can do it!
Hey, I know you can do it.
But can you feel it?
Can you feel the danger?
That's your passage to the other side.
[Dialing, Line Ringing]
Yeah, Pac Tech Security?
I'd like to report a burglary.
1600 Seaward.
- You're setting her up?
- I'm just adding a dash of Tabasco
to the soup.
You're sending her into a danger
she's not ready for.
There's only one way
to find out, you know?
Uh, hello. Sorry.
I just made a real big mistake.
It was just my daughter
coming home late without a key.
- You're messin' with my game.
- Just tryin' to have a little fun.
Raise the bar a little bit. Nothing like
a few 911 calls to spice up the soup.
- Go.
- [Dogs Barking]
Circle.
Carrie?
Carrie?
[Grunting]
- It's me! It's me! It's me.
- Jarod!
- I did it. I got the blueprints.
- You're bleeding.
I cut myself breaking in, and-
Freeze! Police!
Damn it!
Go that way!
Stop!
Go, go, go!
Move it!
"J" man.
The Cheerios are in the cupboard.
Damn thing started bleeding again.
I was looking for something to stop it up.
Yeah, well, there's no thrill
in bleedin' to death, is there?
You know, whether it's
a suicide lunge...
bungee dive, it's all about trust...
in yourself and the ones around you.
- Trust is key.
- Exactly.
- First aid kit's in the bathroom
down the hall.
- Thank you.
[Monitor Beeping]
It's me. Shh. It's Jarod.
We're getting out of here.
Jarod, Zed's been asking for you all night.
It's almost time.
- For what, his final challenge?
You're coming with me.
- Forget it!
If this son ofa bitch is responsible
for my brother's coma, I have to prove it.
That's going to be very difficult
for you to do from prison.
I found out that the Acme Warehouse
is a front for money laundering.
He's gonna use you to steal cash...
just like he used your brother
to rob that coin dealer...
the night of your brother's
so-called accident.
Now, we are leaving.
I don't think so, "J."
You know, Shay, your brother Tony...
was the calmest dude
I ever saw at 30 stories.
You, on the other hand,
look a little pale.
But that's all right, 'cause I only
need you as a sacrificial lamb right now.
Isn't that right, Doc?
Jojo followed you to the hospital.
I don't know who you are, but this
different identity scene must be a rush, huh?
Let's go.
Now I know what Tony must have felt...
when you pushed him off that bridge
wearing that faulty bungee cord.
- This side won't be the same
without you, "J."
- Weights are in, Zeddie.
Give my best to the beast of the gods.
- He'll die!
- Bring her with.
You-
[Gasping]
[Broots]
I sure hope Lyle is still on his campout.
It's stuffy in here.
- Being here gives me the creeps.
- Wow.
His decor is like
Kung Fu meets The Jetsons.
[Sarcastic Chuckle]
From Chinese restaurants
to love lodges...
to this GQ spread
for anal retention...
Jarod's had us running around
in his game show hell.
- Why?
- To find a grand prize of some
kind here in Lyle's apartment.
Something incongruous
with the surroundings.
Something out of place.
A speck of dust would be
out of place in this joint.
I found his Centre expense report.
You can learn a lot about a man
based on the way he spends his money.
Like the fact that my thumbless sibling
rips off the Centre for everything...
from silk stockings to herbal laxatives.
Likes to dine out too.
Look at that.
- There must be over a dozen
charges for The Hidden Truth.
- That's where May Lin worked.
And he has charges from
the Cabins 0'Love Lodge.
Checked out the same day
May Lin vanished.
Miss Parker?
There's two shovels here.
They both have red clay on them.
Not unlike the clay
you found on your shoes.
- Uh-oh.
- What?
There's a door.
Ow.
I got a bad feeling about this.
Smile, Broots. We just won
the big deal of the day.
[Broots]
It's a shed, just like the one
Jarod sent us.
This doesn't make sense.
It makes perfect sense.
Mr. Lyle is locking himself away.
Oh. That makes sense?
[Sydney]
As a child, Mr. Lyle's foster father...
kept him locked in a woodshed
weeks at a time.
We all try to preserve
our childhood...
with one ritual or another.
In Lyle's case, this woodshed
may be the only place...
in the whole world
where he feels safe.
- What does that have to do with May Lin?
- Everything.
- You mean he-
- I believe the word is torture.
I believe the word is murder.
And the Jeopardy answer
is he sleeps in a shed...
just like the one he was
tortured in when he was little.
He stalks and kidnaps Asian women...
who he then brings to
a hidden torture chamber.
- Who is Mr. Lyle?
- Or what?
[Zed]
We're almost into the cash room, boys.
- [Beeping]
- Got it. We're in.
- [Buzzer Sounds]
- It's payday. Go get the cash.
Go!
[Gasps]
Smile, Shay.
This is supposed to be the fun part.
Come on. Let's go.
- Best thrill yet.
- Yo, Zeddie!
It's locked.
Come on, Zeddie!
[Men Shouting, Indistinct]
- [Alarm Sounding]
- What is goin' on here? Aah!
You know, it's amazing what you
can do with a pair of wire cutters...
and a garage door opener.
- Take these cuffs off now!
- That wouldn't be any fun.
Where's the thrill in that?
Speaking of which,
I got a surprise foryou.
- Just... don't go away.
- [Yells]
Here. Go to your mom.
She's worried about you.
Now, go.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm giving you something that
you didn't give Tony- a chance.
Slim, but a chance.
- What's going on, "J"?
- The ultimate thrill.
The ultimate test.
Or should I say, the ultimate splat?
Wow. This cord is so old.
I don't-
I don't know if it's gonna make it through
another jump. Oh, well, like you say-
[Imitating Zed] "It's time to do battle
with the beast of the gods."
- Pull me up, "J," now!
- Oh, can you feel it?
Can you feel the fear?
That's your ticket to the ultimate thrill.
Yeah! Get me down from here!
Did you give Tony Goltz that chance?
He trusted you.
He trusted you to find the father
that he'd been searching for.
He found out you lied to him, that you were
just using him, turning him into a thief.
Tony was gutsy... but stupid.
He was going to turn you
into the police...
so you tied him to a faulty bungee cord
and you tossed him to his death.
Only he didn't die, did he?
Now he's lying in a hospital bed
trapped inside his own body...
and he may never again
experience another thrill.
But then again, neither will you.
No. No. No.
- No. No!
- Ready, set-
Okay! Okay! I did it!
I knew Tony was gonna go to the police.
Now get me down from here!
You'd better relax, Zed.
- Come on. You feel it?
- Yeah, well-
You feel the danger? That's your passage
to the other side, remember?
- No!
- Enjoy your journey.
- No!
- Oh, like you said-
You've got to taste death
to experience life.
[Yelling]
I guess this old cord had
one more jump in it after all.
Get me out ofhere!
It's a beautiful day
in the neighborhood.
What? Jarod attend
a Monty Hall garage sale?
Mr. Lyle, you seem so, um-
Relaxed?
Yeah, I just came in from the mountains.
I heard you had a lead on Jarod.
No, all of this... was a dead end.
Didn't even shed any light
on his personality, Syd?
No. Not on his.
Oh, well.
Um, nothing personal,
but you three look terrible.
You should take a break, rejuvenate...
get into the great outdoors,
relieve some ofthat stress.
God knows it makes me feel so alive.
# [Whistling]
[Cell Phone Ringing]
- I'm gonna throw up.
- What?
One of us has to stop him, Miss Parker.
- I was too late for May Lin.
- I'll keep my eyes open. Count on it.
Jarod, we took a hell of a risk
breaking into Lyle's apartment.
Sometimes, the risks
we take are worth it.
Well, I'll see you next time
on "The Feud."
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
[Broots] Jarod sent these.
From what I can tell,
all taken within the last few weeks.
There's Portland, Houston, Lexington.
- Someone's been tracking us?
- Not us-
You. Look.
Feels like the hunter's
becoming the hunted.
[Ringing]
- What?
- Someone has eyes for you.
The question is, who?
[Jarod]
Sometimes the answer is the question.
Don't get Kwai Chang on me, Jarod.
Ooh, I love that guy,
wandering the earth, helping people.
Like I'm trying to help you
and your father.
My father? Jarod.
[Dial Tone]
- What did he mean, help your father?
- Damn it.
What is it, Parker?
My father is still in hiding...
but I received a cryptic e-mail
from him this morning.
Daddy told me not to trust anyone.
There's a Centre contract
out on my father.
Well, then why-why did he follow you?
They probably think I'll eventually
lead them to the real target.
- [Barking]
- [Chattering]
Don't anybody touch my cards,
or it'll get ugly!
Yeah, huh.
- And Harry cheats.
- Yeah, yeah.
[Barking Continues]
Damn raccoons.
[Footsteps Running]
[Barking Continues]
[Growling]
[Mumbling]
I got something for
your garbage-eatin' little ass.
- [Barking, Whining]
- [Screaming]
The fish is swimming along happily
in its natural environment.
You drop the hook in,
you yank it out, you catch him.
- And then after all that, you release him?
- It's really not that confusing.
- [Siren Wailing]
- Tell that to the fish.
Hey, boy. What's going on?
Hunters caught something freaky
up in the mountains.
- [Chattering]
- [Screaming]
- [Screaming Continues]
- [Screams]
- [Man] Is that a boy or a girl?
- [Gasps]
- Get away from the window.
- [Man] Look.
What kind of creature is that anyway?
- [Grunting] Come on now. Come on.
- [Woman] I think it's a girl.
Don't make it any harder
than it has to be.
[Groaning]
[Woman]
Oh, that poor thing.
- Come on. Get in the car.
- [Whimpering]
I'll take that.
You ever see anything
like that before?
[Mumbling]
[Screaming]
[Siren Wailing]
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because ofwhat I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
[Miss Parker]
He defends the weak and abused.
Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
- [Mumbling]
- [Man] Locate Dr. Bennett right away.
Get a lab crew, linguist, pediatrician.
- I vote for a veterinarian.
- The state is sending
one of their people to observe.
- [Man] A social worker?
- Psychiatrist.
- We don't have much time.
- [Gasps]
- Oh! Damn it!
- Oh, stop her!
Go! Go! Somebody stop her!
[Groans, Hits Ground]
[Man]
It's like she's never seen a window before.
It's okay.
Everything is going to be okay.
It's okay. I'm not
gonna hurt you, honey.
- I'm just gonna clean this up.
- [Whimpers]
How you feeling? Hmm?
All right. I'm almost done.
You're making a big mistake dealing with her
like this. She's afraid to be touched.
We'll instruct our own staff,
if you don't mind, Doctor-
Bell. Jarod Bell.
The state shrink from Provo.
Your office contacted us about your arrival.
- This is Doctor Bennett.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- I'm Dr. Wolverton.
I read your book, The Effects of Isolation
and Deprivation on the Human Psyche.
Your theories prompted a great deal of debate
within the psychiatric community.
My writings are controversial because they push
the envelope of psychosocial medicine.
Well, it's always difficult
to break from the pack.
Given her physical appearance
and her lack ofverbal skills...
she must have been isolated
at a very young age.
The question is, what made her
suddenly decide to make contact.
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- [Whimpers]
We show her kindness,
we establish some kind of trust...
and she'll begin to communicate
in her own way.
We don't have that kind of time.
With no legal guardian...
we lose her to Social Services
in 36 hours.
You haven't been able
to find any family?
No, the police are running her picture
on the net. Until then...
I suggest we take advantage of the time
we have left with our one-of-a-kind specimen.
Bring her out.
- We were looking for you.
- Good news, I hope.
Well- [Clears Throat] The numbers on these
photographs are Level One encryption codes...
used exclusively for
Triumvirate communiques.
- Mutumbo?
- The assassin uploaded them
through our satellites to Africa.
I was able to isolate the killer's designation.
He calls himself "The Owl."
And according to personnel files...
that designation is used by Mr. Cox.
The Grim Reaper.
You can't say Jarod didn't warn us.
[Laughs] Broots, I wanna know everything
about our picture-taking freak.
Uh, Miss Parker, I ran Mr. Cox through
the database. He came up empty.
The guy is a blank slate.
The only proof that we have that he exists
is the fact that we're looking at him.
- Sweep his office.
- He doesn't have one.
But get this.
I-I talked to my friend Rory in Purchasing.
The fellow with the artificial leg?
No, that's Rudy in Public Information.
- Rory's the one with the birthmark
on his head shaped-
- [Stomps]
Iike Gumby.
Okay. Anyway, Rory told me that Mr. Cox
has been mail ordering surgical supplies...
- and having them delivered at the Centre.
- Track the deliveries.
I'm on it.
What if Mr. Cox really
is the Grim Reaper?
- All the more reason to make sure
he doesn't find my father.
- Hmm.
[Banging]
- Make sure to keep her room warm.
- Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
I hate to see her kept in this place.
I'm Dr. Sulvane-Anne.
Dr.Jarod Bell.
I'm the state psych.
She needs familiar surroundings.
Plants, grass, sunshine.
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm sorry. I'm afraid that's not possible.
We have to keep
her environment sterile.
If she's been isolated her entire life,
we don't know what her immune system
can handle.
Well, her vital signs are off the chart.
B.P. is 200 over 120, pulse is 150.
- At least let me give her a mild sedative.
- No meds.
And I want minimal interaction.
We're only here to observe.
How do you expect to find out who she is
if you don't try to communicate with her?
She's unable to communicate, Doctor.
And the hard truth is, she's not going
to learn for a very long time.
I agree with Dr. Wolverton.
We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to study the very core of the human animal.
Specimen, animal.
How about human being?
[Banging Continues]
If you'll excuse us...
we've got to go meet with the press.
[Phone Ringing]
[Sighs]
- Are you okay?
- [Sighs]
[Anne]
I just can't get past her eyes-
how sad they look, how lost.
You know, it only takes
one person to make a difference.
Cardinal rule of traumatized patients, Dr. Bell:
Do not invest emotionally.
How come I don't think
you really believe that?
[Banging Continues]
Where did you come from, little girl?
- [Chattering]
- Doctor! Doctor!
- Is the little girl able to speak?
- Does she understand anything?
- How long has she been in the wilderness?
- First of all...
we don't have any answers as ofyet.
But this is the finest
private research facility in the state.
And we've assembled a team of specialists
who are the best in their fields.
- Was there any sign of abuse?
- How is she holding up emotionally?
[Wolverton] As Dr. Bennettsaid, we have
an expert team working on the situation.
Now, we'll keep you updated
as the situation warrants.
- No more questions. Thank you.
- [Chattering]
No more questions.
Thank you.
[Chattering Continues]
[Man]
Give us the answer to
a simple question, Doctor.
She's pretty.
- Are you on Dr. Bennett's team?
- Not exactly.
- Dr. Jarod Bell.
- Leslie Twain.
I'm with the Salt Lake Chronicle.
If you could just let me get a couple
of pictures, a brief interview for my paper...
I might be able to help you
figure out who she is.
My story would be syndicated
all over the country and-
Dr. Bell is not at liberty
to give interviews.
Rest assured, everything is under control.
[Glass Shatters]
I'm sorry, you're gonna have
to go join the others right now.
- What happened?
- Where the hell did she go? Where?
- Did you check the main building?
- Top to bottom.
She has to be somewhere on the grounds.
- What about the press?
- We moved them in the commissary.
- Wait a minute. What are you
planning on doing with that?
- It's for her own safety.
That weapon was not meant
to be used on humans.
- The subject is in a total state of-
- The subject...
is a little girl who
is scared out ofher mind.
Please, Doctor.
Let us do our work.
[Chattering]
[Woman On P.A.] Dr. Wilson, call extension 11.
Dr. Wilson, extension 11.
What now?
We find her first. Come on.
- Here we go. Take my coat.
- Okay.
- [Gasps, Whimpers]
- It's okay.
It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.
Here.
Go ahead. Take her.
Go ahead.
- [Grunts]
- [Laughs]
You think that's funny?
- I guess that is pretty funny. [Laughs]
- [Laughs]
[Sighs]
- She seems to be reacting to
the change in her environment.
- Hmm.
Hervitals are stable.
She's breathing easier.
So what did you say to her
up in that tree?
Nothing. We just laughed.
What are those plants doing in there?
- That room was to be kept sterile.
- They can't harm her.
[Wolverton] This is too much interaction.
The subject is too important.
The subject? Why don't
we give her a name?
Assigning her a name is
assigning her a personality.
It could prejudice the results
of the case study.
Violet.
Violet. I like it.
- [Babbles]
- She spoke.
[Babbling Continues]
- Wh-What is she saying?
- It's mimicry. Random phonetics.
No. She's trying to tell us something.
[Babbling Continues]
- [Anne] What's happening to her?
- She's going into seizure.
- Help me hold her down.
- [Groaning]
MyGod, she's burning up.
Dr. Bennett, I need my medical bag.
Get my bag now!
[Gasps]
[Woman On P.A.]
Social Services, please call 571.
Social Services, please call 571.
Hey. You should go home
and get some sleep.
Later.
The results of the tests came back.
It was a common flu strain.
It went right through her defenses.
Well, she responded to the medication.
It was scary to see herso helpless.
- Are you investing emotionally, Doctor?
- [Laughs]
I don't understand it. Her room
was sterile, the plants were indigenous...
and none of us exhibited
symptoms ofbeing sick.
- I don't know where the virus came from.
- [Grunting]
Oh, she wants her doll.
It's the only thing that calms her.
What are you doing?
This is a cocktail of cold
and flu strains.
There must be at least
10 separate viruses here.
Or 12.
You think someone purposely
infected this doll?
Unless you believe that
a dozen infectious viruses...
magically infested
the same square inch of material.
Well, I don't understand. Why?
Someone close to the situation is afraid
that Violet is going to begin to communicate.
What you're implying is crazy.
These men are the top in their fields.
Wolverton's research
has saved thousands...
and Bennett's work with P.O.W.'s
in isolation is groundbreaking.
I know the record.
I don't know the men.
We have to get that
little girl out of here.
I can't be a part of this.
I see the way you look at her.
It's not just a doctor-patient relationship.
What are you so afraid of, Anne?
I had a son- Matthew.
He was a little younger
than Violet when he got sick.
I took him to the best clinics
in the country...
the best doctors.
- But I couldn't save him.
- I'm sorry.
Losing him nearly killed me.
I cannot go through
those feelings again.
Not again.
[Door Closes]
[Bennett]
Dr. Bell. Dr. Bell!
- Dr. Bennett.
- I understand that you've located
the source of the illness.
Yes, as matter of fact, I did.
I was going to show it to you in the morning.
It seems that the infection
came from her doll.
This is very disturbing.
- [Clattering]
- What was that?
Dr. Bennett. She's not in her room.
- What?
- The little girl is gone.
Damn it. Damn it!
Violet. Violet, where are you?
[Laughing]
[Laughing Continues]
- [Grunting]
- It's okay. It's my car.
It's okay, honey. It's okay.
You okay?
Wait, wait. Stop, stop.
I'd like a second chance to help,
if you'll let me.
This is the fourth time Cox has pulled over.
What the hell is he looking for?
- I never pictured Cox as
the pickup truck kind of guy.
- [Sighs]
[Miss Parker]
Yeah, well, he's a blank slate, remember?
Oh, which reminds me,
I talked to Rory in Purchasing.
He said he didn't know where Cox
had the surgical tools delivered.
- We're going in circles.
- Wait a minute.
- What's he doing with the shovel?
- Oh, criminy.
That's a dead something.
He's taking pictures of roadkill,
just like he did when he was tracking you.
Flattering comparison. Thank you.
Tell me he didn't just scoop
that worm banquet into the truck.
Ew. What now?
Stay with him. If that psycho
gets to my father, we're all roadkill.
What makes you so sure that
this is where she came from?
The winters in the region
are far too brutal...
for anyone to survive
without some kind of heat source.
- According to this map,
there's just one hot spring in the area.
- [Airplane Passing Overhead]
[Babbles]
Come on.
The water's warm.
Her home must be close.
[Laughs]
[Jingling]
Hmm.
Interesting.
Where did she get the glass?
Or this?
What is it, Jarod?
I think it might be Violet
with her parents.
God. Could it bepossible?
[Babbles]
[Babbling Continues]
Where is she going now?
[Anne]
Oh, my God. It's a wrecked plane.
Jarod, it's her parents.
Da.
Ma.
Da, Ma.
- What is it?
- Looks like some kind of video cable.
[Clock Chiming]
- How's she doing?
- Resting.
[Sighs] Could someone have known about
her being out there and done nothing?
Yes. From the looks of these photos,
it's been going on for over 10 years.
This is personal to you, isn't it?
Yes. It's personal.
You wanna talk about it?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Try me.
- Some other time, maybe.
- Oh, where are you going?
To find out who did this.
- Did someone die?
- Yes.
Where have you been?
- You really were at a funeral.
- In Dover.
Mr. Cox, he spent the night there.
He's pretty chummy with the owner.
- The old guy?
- I'm running him down,
but I don't think...
he has any connection to the Centre.
Weird thing though, Mr. Cox only came
and went through the back door.
With Hefty bags.
Yeah, I don't know what's in them.
What comes out the back door
of a mortuary?
Body parts.
Well, whatever was in them,
he had sent to the east wing of SL6.
East wing. That was the infirmary
when I was a kid.
I got my tonsils taken out there.
Well, I don't think he's handing out
lollipops to little girls.
- Not live ones, anyway.
- Ew.
I think it's time we paid
the Grim Reaper a visit.
[Clears Throat]
Give me the photos.
- What are we doing here?
- I'm gonna leave these for Cox.
Let him know he's being watched too.
[Clinks]
Did you lose something, Mr. Broots?
[Electricity Humming, Crackling]
Love what you've done with the place.
[Sniffs]
That's right.
You had your tonsils removed here, didn't you?
Well, I had to clean out
the old file cabinets.
Out with the files,
in with the body parts?
Hangin'at the mortuary.
Mysterious bags of God knows what.
Scooping roadkill.
- You followed me?
- You take surveillance photos of me...
you better be prepared
for a little retaliation.
Who's the gray hair?
His name is Carl. He's my father.
- Your-Your father's the mortician?
- Mmm.
We used to have long talks about life...
while he was embalming the corpses.
Now we just exchange tricks
of the trade for my hobby.
My father gave me an erector set once.
- Hobby?
- Mmm.
Taxidermy.
Well, it's a second chance at life
as a part of my collection.
The eyes have to be replaced
with glass orbs.
You know, in some cultures
I'm stealing its ability...
to see its way into the afterlife.
Well, that's Dad's theory, anyway.
Daddies can be so much fun.
Speaking of which.
- How is your father these days?
- Wouldn't you love to know?
Oh, Miss Parker.
Those pictures of you-
I didn't take them.
[Electricity Humming, Crackling]
But...
I will be keeping an eye on you.
This is one from the earlier
surveillance tapes.
The footage was taken
near the crash site.
These shots were taken three years later.
[Anne]
I can't believe she survived
all those years alone.
[Jarod]
She was living on pure instinct.
This where she got the wound on her ankle.
[Screams]
That's some kind of animal trap.
- [Screaming]
- How long was she caught in that thing?
According to the logbook, three days.
- Who could've done something like this?
- Watch.
[Screaming]
[Screaming Continues]
My God, it's Dr. Wolverton.
- I'll be damned.
- No.
But he will be.
- [Elevator Bell Dings]
- What do you mean, Cox is telling the truth?
[Clears Throat]
I was digging around, and I found this-
Lyle's expense account.
Three weeks ago, Lyle bought
a very expensive Leica camera.
Well, what kind of camera
do you think took those shots?
And then there's this.
A Centre memo.
Lyle not only brought Mr. Cox to the Centre,
but he created his position.
My brother is behind the hit.
He's trying to kill Daddy?
You have lost your mind.
You took these photos. Cox is
a Centre assassin, and he works for you.
You're suggesting that I would have
my father- our father- killed?
Stop trying to make yourself
a part of this family.
If you looked- really looked-
you would see that I'm just trying
to help him, the same way you are.
Yeah, I got an e-mail from Dad too.
Scared the hell out of me.
He's on the edge of something terrifying.
He told me to take the photos
and leak them to the Triumvirate...
to start establishing a pattern
for your alibi.
- Alibi for what?
- I don't know.
He suggested I start
a paper trail for myself too.
Something big is going down.
So big, Mutumbo's coming to town.
- Mutumbo's coming here?
- According to Dad, to meet with Cox.
I shouldn't be telling you this.
He told me not to trust anyone.
He told me the same thing.
So what do we do now?
We wait, and we pray.
[Bell Tolling]
[Shudders]
- [Grumbles]
- Don't be afraid.
Here's your doll.
I've been watching you for a long time.
I was an observer.
I never interfered.
I never harmed you.
God knows that, and so do you.
[Mutters]
Your fate was determined
by the laws of nature...
not man, not me.
Here.
I'm sorry I have to do this,
but I can't let anybody find out.
[Groaning]
So who's the animal now, Doctor?
- [Whistling]
- Huh? Oh. Oh.
What the-
Where am I? What's going on?
[Jarod]
Disorienting, isn't it?
I magine how it must have felt
for a four-year-old little girl.
Give me my clothes.
Ow! [Groans]
My shoes!
I'd like to, but I wouldn't wanna contaminate
the integrity of my case study.
Besides, Violet had nothing
when you found her.
It would've been no different
if I hadn't found her.
I was just an observer!
It was a scientific study.
Oh, and it paid off for you, didn't it?
Books, research grants, celebrity status.
- Oh.
- Only your data wasn't based
on scientific research.
- It was based on the terror
of an orphaned child!
- [Groans]
How long did she starve alone
in the wilderness for your study, Doctor?
- Help me!
- No can do.
What with the cold,
the sleep deprivation, the hunger-
You're gonna be quite a specimen
when they drag you out of there.
Oh, this is crazy.
I could die down here!
Yes, quite possibly, you could.
We'll just leave that
up to the laws of nature.
Unless you care to confess.
No? Oh, well. Have fun.
All right! I left her out here!
I- I left her out here.
[Sobbing]
God forgive me. What have I done?
- [Sobbing]
- Hey, Doc.
Well, here's something to keep
you company if you get lonely.
Oh.
[Sobbing Continues]
I don't know how to thank you,Jarod.
I'm the one that should be thanking you.
It took a lot of courage to sign
those court papers to become
Violet's legal guardian.
I guess you could say I got a message.
- A message?
- Ah, you wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- Try me.
- [Laughs]
I had a dream last night.
My son came to me,
and he said it would be all right.
He said he didn't want me
to be alone anymore.
- Does that sound crazy?
- It sounds perfect.
[Laughing]
Is that for me?
Mmm. Thank you.
And I have something for you too.
[Gasps, Sighs]
Jah-rod.
Have a beautiful life, okay?
- Bye.
- Bye.
You got a new doll.
- [Door Closes]
- [Engine Starts]
[Vehicle Departs]
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
Fletcher Ridge, Illinois. Large
enough to have a U.P.S. office...
and a driver named Jarod Harper.
Very good, Broots.
Any physical description?
Size, weight and color
all match Jarod perfectly.
And he got the job at almost
exactly the same time that...
- I calculated his position.
- Call Lyle.
- I already have. He's on his way.
- Great. Let's go.
[Cell Phone Rings, Beeps]
- What?
- [Mr. Parker] Angel.
- Angel, I have to see you.
- [Whispering] Daddy?
The junkyard near the Quentin Street
Overpass, and hurry.
- Daddy!
- [Dial Tone]
You look bothered, Miss Parker.
Don't you have
a bake sale to organize?
I know these are
stressful times for you.
That's why I want you to have this.
It's a prayer card.
I slept with it under my pillow.
- That explains the grease stains.
- I asked for it to be filled...
with the answers you need.
- God bless.
- You too.
Parker?
Are you coming?
I'll be back.
- What about Jarod?
- What about Lyle?
Um, buy me some time.
A few hours.
[Siren Wails]
[Second Siren Wailing]
Ouch!
Sorry, mister.
It got away from me.
- Wow. This is a great car.
- Thanks.
- I bought it with my tooth fairy money.
- "Tooth fairy"?
You know, where you put
your tooth under your pillow...
the tooth fairy takes it
and leaves you money.
Didn't you ever get that
when you were a kid?
I wasn't really a kid
when I was a kid.
Thanks, mister.
[Bell Tolling]
[Woman] Would you just shut up?
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Damn it, Sarah,
we don't have a choice.
Cam, we don't need to be
making these arrangements.
The hell we don't! These people
at the hospital already showed...
they don't care whether us Larsens
live or die- Billy, come on.
- Cam, the doctors said-
- I know what the doctors said.
I know what needs to be done.
- Why do you have guns?
- [Engine Revs]
Cam! What are you planning to do?
- I didn't start this, Sarah.
- Cameron!
- Go home!
- [Screams]
Come on, damn it!
[Crying]
Damn it!
Here you go.
Use mine.
[Beeps, Dials]
- [Line Ringing]
- [Woman] 9-1-1. Can I help you?
Yes, ma'am. My name is Sarah Larsen.
My brothers are on the way
to the hospital. They have guns.
I don't know! Look, you just
gotta do something...
before somebody gets hurt, okay?
- [Sobs]
- [Beeps]
I appreciate- Mister?
[Woman On Police Radio] All units,
hostage situation at Saint Mary's Hospital.
- Men considered armed and dangerous.
- [Sirens Wailing]
[People Clamoring]
[Cam] Billy, hurry up
and get those windows painted.
Nobody moves and nobody gets hurt!
We're all gonna be here awhile,
so just get comfortable.
[Woman On P.A.]
All medical personnel.
Prepare to evacuate all non critical
patients from the first floor.
- How you doin', Pop?
- [Machine Beeping]
[Man]
Keep evacuating!
Everybody sit tight
and wait for my command.
If there's a clear shot,
you let me know.
Well, that's an interesting philosophy.
Shoot first, ask questions later.
- Who are you?
- Special Agent Jarod Jackson, Chicago F.B.I.
I'm the hostage negotiator.
- This is my show now.
- Damn!
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
36 hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
[Miss Parker]
He defends the weak and abused.
Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
Best we can figure, there's
a half a dozen people being held.
Including three patients in
the seized wing that could die...
in the next few hours
without treatment.
- Kill that alarm!
- The hostage-takers?
Billy Larsen. He's 21.
Good kid, with no priors.
Big brother Cam's 28.
He's a hothead...
with a sheet that goes
all the way back to high school.
- Weapons?
- Rifle and shotgun,
according to their sister.
- I'll need her brought here
as soon as possible.
- Yes, sir.
- They make any demands?
- Nothing yet.
- What's your read on the situation?
- You're the big badge.
- You tell me.
- They've isolated the situation...
to a specific area of the hospital
where their father is a patient.
My guess, it's some sort of grievance
against the hospital.
- How do you figure that?
- Like you said, I'm the big badge.
Let's go to work.
This is F.B.I. Special Agent
Jarod Jackson.
I want to talk to you
about your demands.
If you've got something on your minds...
now might be a good time
to discuss it.
This is between us and the hospital.
You've got your father in there.
Innocent people who
need medical attention.
Neither one of us want
anyone to die here today.
So why don't you
tell me what you want...
- and we can end this thing.
- [Cam] I want you to write this down.
$41,342.17.
Not a penny more, not a penny less.
Over and out.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Need to establish a direct
phone line into that room.
- Yes, sir.
- What if they don't answer?
Hell, they could have already killed
somebody, and we'd never know it.
Where can I get blueprints
of this building?
- I can get 'em here 10 ten minutes.
- All right.
I need a fiber-optics video camera, with
a transmitter and microwave intercept.
Hold on, Einstein.
This town has two red lights,
three hardware stores.
- Meaning?
- Meaning, if you want a hammer,
I can help you out.
You want to build a nuclear reactor,
you're outta luck.
- This town have an electronics store?
- That we got.
I'm going to make a list
of things I need.
Get these to me, A.S.A.P.
[Engine Revving]
[Beeping]
[BabyCrying]
[Crying Continues]
Angel.
- Ugh.
- You weren't followed?
- Daddy, you look-
- Oh, I'm sorry to scare you.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
- Daddy, what the hell is going on?
- Come on, come on.
Come on back here.
Sit down.
- [Panting]
- Where have you been?
Underground. This is the last place
they'd look. [Panting]
Now, look.
There's a strongbox in SL-22.
- In a panel behind the fire hose.
- Strongbox?
Yeah. It's filled with cash.
Bring it to me.
But don't tell anybody.
Life and death, understand?
- No, I don't.
- Brigitte and I had to leave
our hiding place.
I need the money to last us a few weeks.
- Daddy, if I knew why you were running-
- [Cell Phone Rings]
- [Beeps]
- What?
Bad news. Jarod never showed up
for his shift at the U.P.S. job.
- We missed him!
- Lyle?
He's looking for you,
and he is peeved.
What else is new? I want you
to keep searching for Jarod.
- I'll be back as soon as I can.
- [Kissing Sound]
Daddy?
[Woman] This whole thing is gonna
turn into a nightmare.
Nobody's gonna want to
get treated at the O.K. Corral.
- Who are you?
- Rebecca Simons, hospital administrator.
Dr. Stephen Franklin,
chief cardiologist.
They spoke to the Larsen boys
before they pulled their guns.
- I'm listening.
- Family brought their father.
- Jake Larsen.
- He was complaining of chest pains.
- Family thought it might be a heart attack.
- He was admitted to C.C.U.?
Yes, yes. I diagnosed him with a type of
arrhythmia known as atrial fibrillation.
It's painful, but it's
not life-threatening.
- Apparently, his sons had a different opinion.
- Maybe I should have kept...
Mr. Larsen one more night
to ease their minds.
Does this figure mean
anything to you, Doctor?
$41,342.17?
- Not in particular. What is it?
- [Sighs] That's a good question.
Agent Jackson,
there are patients in there...
who will die in the next few hours
if left untreated.
[Sighs]
Excuse me.
Sarah, my name is Jarod.
- The man with the telephone.
- I'm with the F.B.I.
I think it's safe to say that neither one of us
woke up this morning expecting to be here.
- [Sighs]
- I realize that you're going through...
a very difficult time right now.
But I have to understand:
Why are your brothers doing this?
Look, I want to end this thing
without anybody getting hurt.
But the truth is, I can only hold
those men off for so long.
Move over there.
Get that door.
Everything was always
pretty crazy in our family.
But things seemed to really
come undone after Mom died.
- Especially for Cam.
- Your mom was here, at this hospital.
Same room where Daddy is.
[Sighs] She was so sick
when they sent her home...
and... she died a few days later.
And now your father's here.
Look, my brothers may be
doing the wrong thing...
but they must be doing it
for the right reason-
and I am not gonna help you
kill them for it.
Agent Jackson.
Got the equipment you wanted.
All right. Let's see
what's going on in there.
- [Heart Monitor Beeping]
- [Moaning]
- What are we gonna do, Cam?
- I'm thinking!
[Softly]
I'm thinking.
[Billy] I hope you know
what you're doin', big brother.
- I don't get it.
- Sometimes it helps to be a fly on the wall.
Or in this case, the airvent.
Grab those blueprints.
This will give us a better sense of the space
where the hostages are being held...
windows, exits-
[Deputy]
I'll be damned.
I could use this to get a clean shot. I have
men on the roof, next to the seized wing.
Isn't it your job to consider
everybody's safety?
My job is to save the lives
of those civilians inside!
If I hesitate, and one innocent person
dies, it's my fault.
I won't make that mistake.
The sheriff seems a little on edge.
[Deputy]
He has his reasons.
[Jake] Cam! What the hell
do you think you're doin'?
- [Cam] I know what I'm doin', Pop.
- You wouldn't be here...
if your mama was still alive.
Well, she's not, and I am.
Stop talkin'.
Just get some rest.
Man, there are guns and badges
all over the place down there.
[Sighs] Well, what the hell did
you think was gonna happen?
Come in here with guns, they'd leave
a parking ticket on our car?
Just keep lookout.
Sheriff says,
kill the air and the lights.
[Motors Decelerating]
You two get down!
- [Jake Gasping]
- What now?
[Phone Ringing]
- Yeah.
- Cam. This is Agent Jackson.
Turn the lights and air back on!
All right, I'll give you what you want,
and you give me a couple of hostages.
- Why should I trust you?
- You have my word.
No harm will come to you or your brother,
as long as we keep talking.
It's going to get really warm in there.
Now, do we have a deal?
Cam. You can trust me.
- Cam? Talk to me.
- [Gunshot]
Get down!
Everybody get down!
[Screaming]
[Gunshots Continue]
I had Cam's trust until
your sniper got trigger-happy.
Hey! Cam Larsen isn't
a man who can be trusted.
He incited a riot while he was in prison.
Did you know that?
The guards were beating the prisoners, and
they were convicted on brutality charges.
Did you know that?
I got Cam on the line.
- Cam.
- Are you guys crazy?
I had nothing to do with that
shooting, I swear to you.
Look, i-it's important that I come
in there and speak to you face-to-face.
I'm not here to talk!
I'm here to save my dad's life.
Understand? It's too hot in here.
Turn on the air, now.
Yes. Yes, I will turn the air conditioning
back on, I promise.
- Now, can I come in there?
- [Sighs Deeply]
Okay. But just you.
Unarmed. Ten minutes.
- All right. Ten minutes.
- [Line Clicks]
- Those are Cam's kids.
- I had them brought in.
- To get under his skin?
- To get into his heart.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- What?
- Where are you?
- Never mind. Did you find Jarod?
I was scanning police chatter
in Fletcher Ridge...
and I came across a hostage negotiation
situation there at a hospital.
- F.B.I. involvement.
- And?
It sounded like something
that Jarod would be drawn to...
- so I-I contacted the Chicago office
of the F.B.I.-
- Let me guess.
- No F.B.I. involvement.
- If there were any agents on the job there...
they would have come from the Chicago
office, and they hadn't sent anybody.
[Groans] He never left town. Get the jet
ready, and I'll be back as soon as I can.
- [Softly] What about Lyle?
- Lyle who?
[Hangs Up Receiver, Beeps]
Hmm.
I love ice cream.
[Smacking Lips]
I want to help your dad, but I'm going
to need your help to do it.
[Siren Wailing]
Last night, Daddy was
yelling at Billy and Sarah.
- He was angry?
- He said the hospital was gonna
send Grandpa Jake home to die.
Just like they did Grandma.
He said they were murderers.
- Murderers.
- [Sighs]
- Looks like you just lost a tooth.
- It fell out.
Are you going to put it under your pillow?
For the tooth fairy?
- Tonight.
- Wow.
- How much you figure you're gonna get?
- Mm-
- Maybe a dollar.
- A dollar.
How would you...
- [Helicopter Whirring]
- like to make five?
[Helicopter Passing By]
It's Agent Jackson.
I'm coming in, and I'm unarmed.
[Heart Monitor Beeping]
Check him out.
He's clean.
Could have got somebody killed,
shootin' in here like that.
That was a mistake. That officer
has been removed from the line.
We're not exactly talking about
an elite police force out there.
- [Cam] Tell me about it.
- So, are you ready to end this thing, Cam?
Get your father taken care of?
I know you care about him.
That's why you're doing this.
- You don't know nothin'.
- Why don't you explain it to me?
$41,342.17.
- That's an odd price to place on somebody's life.
- It's not my price. It's theirs.
- [Moaning]
- Oh, she's gettin' worse.
- Hey-hey!
- So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna keep her here and let her die?
Her life for your father's, is that it?
- Cam, maybe we should let her go, huh?
- Billy, shut up!
- [Gasps]
- You're not a killer, Cam.
You let this woman die, and you're going
to spend the rest of your life in prison.
You and Billy, here.
- Think about your children.
- My kids.
- They won't understand this.
- Can't believe how much
your little boy looks like you.
- You talked to my boy?
- It'sprocedure. Oh, Cody.
He asked me to give you this.
[Helicopter Whirring]
- So, how much do you want me
to leave for him?
- How much?
Money. From the tooth fairy.
Right. Tooth fairy.
You got a dollar?
- All I got's a five.
- Give it here.
- You're gonna give him five bucks
for a baby tooth?
- Just give me the money.
You walk outta here now, you can still put
this money under your son's pillow yourself.
I can't leave him.
[Sighs]
Man, you don't get it, do you?
This isn't just about my father. It's about
every person out there who is sick...
and deserves to be treated with dignity.
They're gonna send this man home. Does
he look like he should go home to you?
- [Gasping]
- At least, give me a hostage.
- [Scoffs]
- You gotta work with me here, Cam.
There are a lot of people out there
looking for any reason to shoot you...
and your little brother over here.
[Woman Breathing With
Diffilculty, Coughing]
All right. Take that lady.
Take her. Help him.
Unhook her, and get her out of here.
- What about the others?
- One at a time.
Allright, allright, allright.
One at a time.
You're doing a good thing here, Cam.
[Chattering On Police Radio]
If some of those patients don't get treatment
real soon, we could have a disaster here.
- Meaning?
- Maneuver Cam to a window.
One shot, and it's over.
Why is it that you feel that
bullets are the only option?
One shot.
Deputy, may I have a word with you?
[Heart Monitor Beeping]
[Spitting]
- What's your name?
- Lindsay.
L-Lindsay Tyler.
Shouldn't bite your nails,
Lindsay. It's a bad habit.
- I know.
- Y-You don't remember me, do you?
- Should I?
- Cindy Perkins?
Junior high school,
Sadie Hawkins dance-
I asked you to dance once,
and you said yes?
- [Sighs]
- I had stringy hair, braces-
Yeah, yeah.
You chased me around the gym all night.
What was that, 10, 15 years ago?
You kept asking the band
to play your favorite song.
- "Dream Weaver." [Chuckles]
- That's a damn fine song.
[Helicopter Passing Overhead]
You know, my dad
died of heart problems.
Th-That's why I went into nursing.
Your father sort of
reminds me of my dad.
[Jake Coughing]
Look, Cindy-
[Sighs Deeply]
I'm sorry about all this.
I never meant to-
- Cam?
- [Alarm Beeping]
- Cam, come here.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
He's not breathing!
- [Ringing]
- I need a doctor in here now! Now!
All right, Cam. I'll send one in.
Get your gear.
- [Doctor] No.
- What did you say?
Those men are heavily armed, and they've
threatened the lives of innocent people.
Unless you can assure me
of my safety, I'm not going anywhere.
- Get the lights back on in that room.
- What are you gonna do?
Agent Jackson.
Agent Jackson!
Cam, it's Agent Jackson.
I'm coming in.
- I asked for a doctor!
- Cam, he's going into cardiac arrest!
- Let him in, Cam.
- [Alarm Buzzing]
- We didn't come here to kill our own father.
- [Alarm Continues]
- [Assisted Breathing]
- Come in!
- Easy, easy!
- Where is the doctor?
[Jarod] There isn't a doctor available.
I can handle this.
- [Exhales]
- [Huffs]
I hope you can handle this.
'Cause if my old man dies, so do you.
[One Long Beep]
- [Cindy] He's been flat for 15 seconds.
- [Electrical Whining]
- Paddles charged?
- Clear.
- [Electrical Thumping]
- [Cindy] Nothing. 25 seconds.
- Talk to him.
- What?
I need him to fight.
Tell him a story from your past.
Something you did together.
Talk to him. Clear.
- [Thumps]
- Nothing.
- We're running out of time. Talk to him.
- [Cindy] 40 seconds.
Dad, remember when I was
five years old...
how you used to take me
hunting up near Patchett Lake?
I'm going to 360 joules.
Keep talking.
- [Paddles Charging]
- Used to wake me up early,
while it was still dark out.
I used to hate gettin'up so early,
but you said it was important...
- to get out before the sun.
- [Jarod] Clear!
You told me that a sunrise in the woods was
as close to God as a breathin' man could get.
- [Paddles Whining]
- Remember when you said that?
Remember that, Dad?
- [Cindy] One minute.
- Clear.
- [Thumping]
- [Gasping]
- Come on, old man. Fight! Don't give up! Fight.
- [Cindy] 70 seconds.
- Don't leave us, please.
- [Paddles Charging]
- We need you.
- I'm gonna hit him again. Clear!
Come on, you can fight this!
Come on, Pop.
We need you.
Cody and Kerry need their grandpa.
If we don't get him back quick,
there could be permanent damage.
Don't die on me, Dad. Hang in there.
Come on. Don't die on me, Dad.
- Come on, pop!
- I'm getting a pulse.
[Steady Beeping]
They really train 'em
up there at the F.B.I. Academy.
[Police Chattering On Radio]
Let's get a closer look.
[Whirring, Banging]
- What the hell was that?
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know. The signal went dead.
- [Panting] Look, Cam.
You've made all the right choices up till now.
Let me take another hostage out of here.
- Okay. Yeah. You, Cindy. Go home.
- No.
- What?
- I don't leave until you do.
For my father.
I-I'll go.
- I've got to get that picture back.
- [Jarod, Indistinct]
- [Deputy] We've still got sound, Sheriff.
- [Whirring, Banging]
What the hell is this?
You've been watchin' us
the whole time!
I should blow you away right now!
I knew I couldn't trust you people!
- [Moaning]
- No, no!
No. Cam. Not like this.
[Helicopter Whirring]
All right. Get out.
Take her with you.
No more talking! Just get out!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Please take care of her.
- Are you out of your mind?
- Hey, it was an accident!
You could have gotten all of us killed
in there. We can't keep pushing him.
- Why can't you get that through your head?
- I've had a bellyful of you.
- Oh, yeah? And what is that supposed to mean?
- You're the big badge.
You figure it out.
[Keypad Beeping]
- [Line Ringing, Clicking]
- Alice? Get me the number
for the F.B.I. office in Chicago.
[Sighs]
[Sydney] I doubt you'll find Miss Parker
searching through her desk.
[Broots] We saw her this morning.
I think she had some errands to run.
She didn't say where she was going?
You know your sister. You know she dances
to the beat of a different drummer.
- [Slams Book Closed]
- So I've noticed.
You two wouldn't lie to me, would you?
So, a-anybody see the, uh,
Redskins game this weekend?
Agent Jackson. Any idea when
I might be allowed back in my office?
- No idea.
- Oh. [Sighs]
That's very impressive, the way
you handled that code situation.
I didn't have much of a choice, did I?
Tell me something.
How are insurance claims
processed at this hospital?
In the middle of a hostage situation, and
you're wondering about billing procedure?
I'm just curious.
For instance, an H.M.O. claim.
H.M.O.'s rely on the information
provided by the attending physician.
So a particular medical procedure
would be approved or denied...
- based upon your recommendation.
- Yeah, that.
And the recommendation of
the facilities administrator.
- Rebecca Simons.
- In the case of this hospital, yes.
What percentage of major surgeries
have been denied at this hospital?
- [Sighs] Oh, I-I don't know.
- Take a guess.
[Stammering]
I-I don't know. Fifty percent?
Sixty-eight percent: 11 percentage points
higher than the national average.
- Why do you think that is?
- Maybe there are just a lot
of healthy people in this town.
- Maybe.
- [Helicopter Whirring]
[Dialing Phone]
- [Line Clicking]
- Uh, we need to talk.
[Siren Wailing]
[Scoffs]
You look like hell.
[Chuckling]
That's the way it is when you're dyin'.
Got yourself in a real mess here, boy.
Like everything else in my life.
Look, maybe I didn't do the things
I should have when you were small.
Hell, I- I was makin' it up as I went.
But I taught you kids
right from wrong. I did that.
- I'm tryin' to save you, Dad.
- Why?
Because we're a family.
I never knew my own old man.
Not more than a smack in the head
now and then.
I just did the best that I could, and-
[Sobs]
When your mama died-
I think a little bit of me went too.
Guess we've been fightin'
the same pain.
[Sobbing]
I miss her. Every day.
Me too, Pop.
[Exhales]
[Jarod]
$41,342.17.
This is the exact amount this hospital
charges for heart bypass surgery.
- What are you talkin' about?
- Jake Larsen has sky-high levels
of creatine kinase enzyme...
- in his blood.
- So?
- His fingertips are blue from lack of oxygen.
- I still don't follow.
He has heart disease.
He's headed for a massive heart attack.
His only chance of survival
is heart bypass surgery.
The same surgery
this hospital denied him. [Sighs]
- Who the hell are you?
- Excuse me?
I called the F.B.I. Nobody's ever heard
of an Agent Jarod Jackson.
Well, it's a big agency.
Maybe you talked to the wrong person.
If any of those people in there die,
it's on your head.
You understand what that means, to have
somebody's blood on your hands?
As a matter of fact, I do.
And so do you.
Your deputy told me about that hostage
situation a year ago at the grocery store.
The way you lured that
perpetrator into the doorway...
and hesitated to take the kill shot.
Did he tell you how that same
hostage-taker took his gun...
and shot to death
a 15-year-old stock boy?
Did he describe the sick feeling
I get every time I see
that boy's parents on the street?
- You did what you thought
was the right thing to do.
- And an innocent boy...
lost his life.
That's the blood I have on my hands...
Agent Jackson.
[Siren Wailing]
Certainly has been
a long day, hasn't it?
- Agent Jackson.
- I was wondering if you and I
could have a little talk.
Oh, well, the truth is,
I'm late for a meeting. Perhaps later.
I know about the cover-up concerning
Jake Larsen's coronary disease.
But what could an H.M.O. possibly
have to gain by such a cover-up?
I saw you and Dr. Franklin arguing in
the parking lot. I know what's going on.
We could talk about it here in private,
or we could go downtown...
and talk under the glare
of the television cameras.
It's up to you.
Is it just for the money?
Or is it something more personal?
I see the way you and
Dr. Franklin are together.
My girlfriends and I...
used to dream about meeting a doctor.
Falling in love,
and living happily ever after.
I actually believed that's the way
it would be for Stephen and me.
Your signature is on the release forms
for all the patients in question.
I made my decisions based on
Franklin's recommendations.
I looked the other way in one case,
next thing I knew, I was-
All for money.
Franklin was getting kickbacks from
the H.M.O.'s for not doing expensive surgeries.
By denying certain procedures
to critically ill patients...
he saves the H.M.O.
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
- And makes a nice percentage.
- I swear to you...
I didn't know about Jake Larsen
until his sons took over the hospital.
Franklin said that you questioned him,
and he threatened to expose me...
if I said anything, and-
I was afraid.
Not half as afraid as those patients
who were sent home to die.
- The key you gave me doesn't work.
- Really? Huh.
Must have given you the wrong one.
Here, let me try this one.
- [Key Turning Lock]
- Yep. That works. [Chuckling]
Angel, I'm sorry I had
to drag you into this.
"Baby Parker."
Wh-What was that?
Oh, it's nothing.
- It looked like a medical record.
- It's ancient history.
- It is mine, or Lyle's?
- It doesn't matter!
Trust me. Some day, when I have more time,
I'll explain everything to you.
- But right now, I need your gun.
- My gun?
This is about that hit out on you.
Yeah, the bastards are closin' in.
- Who ordered it?
- I don't know. I don't know.
I do know... this...
is the only thing that really matters.
It's the future of our family.
It's the heir to the Parker name,
and it's growing inside Brigitte.
The baby'll be here soon.
- What else can I do?
- Well, the key is still Jarod.
Bring him back, and
it'll be just like it was.
[Cell Phone Ringing]
[Ringing]
- [Beeping]
- I'm on my way.
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Phone Ringing]
- Yeah?
- Dr. Franklin?
Agent Jackson. Cam and Billy Larsen
have tapped into hospital records...
and are trying to find information
about patients who were denied care.
- Can you cut them off?
- We tried.
I suggest I download everything. I wouldn't
want you to lose any patient records.
No! No, I'll, uh-
I'll handle that.
I-I know which files are important.
Can I get back in my office yet?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Things are still pretty dangerous up here.
I couldn't assure your safety.
Dr. Franklin?
- Dr. Franklin.
- I'm on my way up.
If you think that's best.
[Coughs]
- [Gunshots]
- [Glass Breaking]
- What happened?
- I was shot! The Larsen boys.
They're crazy!
They're coming down the hallway.
They say they know who's responsible
for trying to kill their father.
I've gotta get out of here.
[Grunts]
- Doctor?
- I can't breathe! [Panting]
My heart!
[Groans]
[Panting]
What's happening to me?
The same thing that you
let happen to Jake Larsen.
You're having a massive heart attack.
[Gasping] Wha-
What have you done to me?
I laced your keyboard with
a tricyclic antidepressant.
It's absorbed through the fingertips.
Speeds up the heart's rhythm.
That's why I faked getting shot...
told you that the Larsen boys
were coming down the hallway-
I wanted to scare you. You see, adrenaline,
it really increases the effects of the drug.
- [Gasping] Why?
- Because of what you did to Jake Larsen.
Because of the drugs you gave him to cover
up the symptoms of his coronary disease.
- [Groaning] Who are you?
- I'm everyone.
I'm no one.
If you tell me the truth...
I can bring your heart
back to normal.
Look, we're all on the same
side here- [Grunting]
There's no reason
to let this become a problem.
Oh, it became a problem when
you aligned yourself with an H.M.O....
that cared more about profits
than taking care of patients.
God, Larsen wouldn't have survived
another year no matter what we did.
That is not the point!
You're a doctor!
Your job is to give care,
not take it away!
- [Groans In Pain]
- That cyanosis must really
be setting in right now.
You should really seek treatment.
Or you can die within minutes.
- Please! Please!
- How many people?
How many people did you let die
so you could stuff your pockets?
[Grunts] All right,
I took kickbacks from the H.M.O.'s...
to send patients home-
now please, help me!
- Please!
- Sorry, Doc.
But your claim has been denied.
No! No.
[Sobbing, Groaning]
[Chattering On Police Radio]
- Is he really gonna die?
- I just laced his keyboard with trigoxin.
He has nothing more than
a really bad case of heartburn.
And he'll probably lose
bladder control for a couple of days.
[Chattering On Police Radio]
[Grunting]
- [Sighs]
- [Siren Wailing]
I'm gonna drop some of the charges
against the brothers.
Let the judge deal with the rest.
Considering the circumstances, I think
they've suffered enough for one family.
I think you're right.
Thank you for keeping me
from doing something stupid.
I guess we can't let the mistakes
of our past ruin our future.
Will you excuse me, Sheriff?
Excuse me. Are you
from the Chicago office?
- Are you a reporter?
- Blue Cove Gazette.
Have you been involved
during the entire crisis?
No, I just arrived on the scene.
There was another negotiator involved.
Our source from your Chicago office...
- tells us he was an impostor.
- That's what we've been told.
- And where is he?
- No idea.
I don't know how he did it, but witnesses
say he really knew what he was doing.
Excuse me.
It's your fault we missed him.
[Mr. Parker]
Now don't tell anybody.
Life and death, understand? Someday, when I
have more time, I'll explain everything to you.
Well, the key is still Jarod.
Bring him back,
and it'll be just like it was.
You're gonna be held
accountable for this, Parker.
I know. Let's go home.
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
[Man]
Previously on The Pretender.
- Have we met?
- Thomas Gates. Friends call me Tommy.
I don't have any friends.
Everything that
I've ever done or felt...
it was wasted because
you weren't part of it.
Thomas?
- I find it hard to believe...
- Thomas?
that somebody breaks into your house,
shoots your lover point blank in the head.
- Oh, my God.
- At least I know how to protect
the ones I love.
The man the police think killed Thomas Gates
died of a drug overdose in his cell.
Daddy, this man was the last link
in proving who killed Thomas.
I don't want any trace
of Centre involvement.
They killed them all.
And for what?
- What will you do now?
- Find out who did this and make them pay.
[Miss Parker]
Tell me about yourself.
- What do you want to know?
- Everything.
[Gates]
Bridget seems like a nice person.
If it's making you this miserable, maybe
you should stop spending time with them.
- They're my family.
- Maybe you should think about
starting a new one.
[Miss Parker] There are places
in me, Tommy. Dark places.
If something is not right,
we'll deal with it. Together.
I'm a fix-it man, remember?
[Gates]
I will make you a deal.
When I die, I'll leave you all my shirts.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I'm not goin' anywhere.
Hmm?
[Shower Water Running]
Parker?
Tommy.
I love you, Parker.
[Phone Ringing]
[Line Ringing]
- [Sighs]
- [Beeps]
Must be the 10th time
I got her phone machine.
[Sydney]
You left the address, didn't you?
Maybe Miss Parker will meet us here.
Syd, she hates anyone to enter
one of Jarod's lairs before she does.
[Sighs]
It doesn't make sense.
- Something's up.
- Think back one year, Broots.
- Thomas?
- Thomas?
Today? It's a year to the day that
she found Thomas murdered at her house?
I'm such an idiot.
I left all those phone messages on her machine
like it was just any other day.
It is just any other day.
Same clown.
Different side show.
I'm sorry, Miss Parker.
Thank you.
So, what's up with Jarod the jester?
Well, Syd and I have barely scratched
the surface, if you want to start diggin' in.
[Clears Throat]
Have Clean-up crate everything.
If we can't figure out
what Jarod's up to...
we can donate this stuff to
a two-ring circus looking to add a third.
We did find one thing.
The celebrity clown of a local kiddie show,
Marco the Magnificent...
was arrested yesterday
on molestation charges.
Police found him
locked in a lion cage...
[Chuckles]
with raw beef strapped to his-
Anyway, well, it's all in there.
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, I give you...
Ringmaster Jarod.
What is it?
It's-
It's Jarod's twisted little model...
of my first meeting with Thomas.
- Bastard.
- I'm sure there's an innocent reason
Jarod left it.
Right.
And O.J. was just chipping golfballs.
All I'm saying is-
It's bad enough he knows
how Thomas and I met, but...
the fact that he left it for me
on this day is no mistake.
For once, admit he's tormenting me
just to torment me.
And wherever he is,
I just know he's laughing.
[Nose Squeaks]
Hardly laughing.
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
[Miss Parker]
He defends the weak and abused.
[Jarod]
Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
To houses skillfully turned into homes.
To empty hearts filled up again.
To new beginnings that might have been.
All left with you, my love.
Beautiful words.
What, no confetti gongs, joy
buzzers, squirting flowers?
- None of this is a laughing matter.
- Yeah.
No, you really caught me
in a mood today.
I'm real tempted to put a cap in you...
wipe the slate clean on my life
and take off without ever looking back.
Your gun won't work.
I took the firing pin out last night.
I sleep with this under my pillow.
And you drool out of
the left corner of your mouth.
What the hell are you
doing here, Jarod?
It's time to take care of
some unfinished business...
to find out who killed
the man you loved and why...
and to pay respects
to a man like Thomas Gates...
because he deserves it.
Just because you're a genius
doesn't mean you know what he deserves.
Why are you tormenting me, Jarod?
Why do you even c-care?
[Sydney]
Rumor5-8-2-5-9?
[Broots]
Yeah. Standard Centre coding logistics.
In this case, "rumor" would be
the code name of the operative in charge.
As far as the numbers,
I'll have to talk to Manny.
- You know the mute guy
down in Communications?
- He, the one without a tongue?
Yeah. I guess it'd be pretty pointless
to play spin the bottle with a guy like that.
I mean, if I was a woman.
Anyhow, off hand I'd say
these numbers might be a code...
for a Centre audio phone tap file.
Find out from Manny
the marble mouth which one.
Well, given the climate around here, Miss Parker,
I don't think that's gonna be too easy.
- Why?
- Oh, you haven't heard?
Mutumbo's dead,
as in "Ding-dong, the wicked witch is."
Dead.
Triumvirate's crazy Zulu
appears to have been murdered.
- [Mr. Lyle] Two shots through the heart.
- Small target.
And whoever put the bullets in Mutumbo
also gouged out his eyes.
Like he saw something
he wasn't supposed to.
Speaking of which, when was the last time
you laid eyes on your father?
When is the last time
somebody checked for your pulse?
- [Giggling]
- [Clears Throat] Um-
Now, now.
I merely ask because family
is the most important thing in the world.
My family.
Your family.
The Centre family.
Care to translate
for Barney the dinosaur?
The gun that was used
to kill Mutumbo...
was traced to the highest level
of the Centre.
A level that includes you,
Mr. Lyle, and dear old dad...
who just happens to gain
the most from Mutumbo's sudden... erasure.
You think my father killed him?
Anyone could have.
After all, when we miss the ones we love
and survival's at stake...
we're capable of anything.
Tommy.
Talk to me, Parker.
There's something on your mind. I can tell.
Yes. I-
I-
It's okay.
In your own time.
Miss Parker.
The search for your father
has and will continue to intensify...
on my authority.
He will be found.
And when he is,
those allied with him...
could find themselves
endangered species.
He was as much as accusing you of-
hell, accusing me
of participating in a coup.
The least you could do
is pretend to listen. Parker?
Call me...
when you're back with the living.
[Miss Parker]
Do you believe in ghosts, Syd?
[Sydney]
I believe in an afterlife. Second chances.
I'm talking about Thomas.
His... presence is all around me.
Sometimes I hear
my mother's whisper of consolation...
my father's laughter.
Those we love...
are with us always...
in life and death.
It's more than that.
I see him.
Almost touch him.
The anniversary of his death.
Your father's disappearance.
Now Mutumbo's assassination.
Understress,
the mind is capable of many things.
It's not my mind playing tricks on me.
It is Thomas.
He's-
He's in the room with me...
like- like he's waiting.
Maybe he is.
Maybe he's giving you that second chance
to complete something...
left unfinished.
[Phone Rings]
[Beeps]
- Angel.
- Daddy?
Are you all right?
- Better than anybody,
now that Mutumbo's, you know-
- You?
Me kill him? If I had,
he'd be missin' more than his eyes.
Daddy, they're looking for you.
- Cox.
- Let him. My comeback plan's workin'.
One more piece, and everything
will be back to normal.
- You sound different.
- Damn straight.
I'm gonna be a father again.
I haven't felt like this
since you were born.
- Listen, we need to hook up.
- Where?
I haven't decided. Just keep your eyes open
and your back covered. And, angel?
This turmoil? It's almost over.
- The survivors will be together soon.
- [Line Hangs Up]
[Scoffs]
"Survivors."
[Broots]
As Manny explained to me, this code-
You... had a conversation
with a tongueless mute?
No. [Chuckles]
Not in so many words. But I-
- Broots.
- Okay.
The phone tap...
was on Thomas's phone.
All of it was routed to an operative,
code name Rumor.
I still haven't figured out who that is yet,
but I was able to unscramble part of the call.
And I-I-I downloaded it.
Play it.
[Gates] Yeah. Parker and I are
goin'away for the weekend,
so we'll talk when I get back.
[Jarod] Okay, buddy.
I'll see you again soon.
- [Gates] You take care, Jarod.
- [Line Clicks]
Tommy and Jarod...
were friends?
[Gates]
Talk to me.
[Exhales]
- [Shower Faucet Squeaks]
- [Shower Water Running]
Tommy?
Tommy.
[Both Gasp]
Angel.
Oh, geez.
I thought I was gonna have
a tub birth there for a second.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- You look like you just saw a ghost.
- No. I-
- I'm so glad you're all right, Daddy.
- I'm just fine.
It's Brigitte we need to worry about.
Yeah.
Carryin' a new life.
It's God's ultimate challenge.
How did you get here?
I didn't see your car.
Uh, we, uh, hitched a ride, came up
the back path and used the key you gave us.
Did I?
- I need a favor.
- Anything. I want to help.
Both of you.
Yeah, good. We're gonna have to
help each other. I gotta have your car.
He found a safe place for the birth.
Yeah, we gotta keep movin' for the baby.
And a doctor we can trust
for the delivery.
- Daddy.
- Hmm?
Tell me where you're going.
Please? I just-
I need to be a part
of something positive right now.
I can't.
It's not safe.
Listen, just because Mutumbo's dead
doesn't mean his order to kill us is.
You see, I think the hitter's real close.
- I think it's Cox.
- Well, it's a pro, that's for damn sure.
That's why you have to carry on
business as usual.
Now, it won't be long. I'm just
one piece away from bein' back...
runnin' the Centre.
- I can get you that piece if you just-
- No, no. You can't.
I'll have it real soon.
- Now, give me the car keys. Come on.
- There.
- You take care of that brother
or sister of mine.
- I will.
Come on.
Let's go.
- [Door Opens]
- Daddy?
Hmm?
What is Rumor 5-8-2-5-9?
Beats the hell out of me.
Rumor is a code name
for the operative in charge of that file.
- The rest sounds like a digital phone tap number.
- Yeah. See?
We gotta help each other.
Come on.
Now remember, business as usual.
[Mr. Parker]
Remember, business as usual.
[Brigitte] Rumor's a code name
for the operative in charge of that file.
[Gates] Talk to me, Parker.
There's something on your mind, I can tell.
[Jarod] It's time to find out
who killed the man you loved and why.
[Phone Rings]
- [Rings]
- [Click]
- What?
- Let's hope there's not
a digital tap on this phone.
It didn't stop you and Tommy
from becoming fast friends.
- At least you've deciphered
some of what Rumor means.
- I'm just getting started.
So why not save me some time...
and just tell me who killed him?
I don't know.
You listen to me, Jarod.
The rules that you and I
have been playing by-
my indentured servitude to this house
of horrors, you shaking your family tree-
you just throw those the hell out
the window when it comes to Thomas!
He is not a game!
I would never treat him like one.
Deception was never my goal
with you and Thomas.
Your goal? What goal?
[Sighs]
Love.
Putting you two together was one of
the most rewarding things I've ever done.
Putting us together?
You're a liar.
We had a chance meeting
in Blue Cove at a gas stat-
You didn't meet him after I did.
You knew him before?
The way you felt about each other
had nothing to do with me.
I just- I just lit the torch.
- [Sobs]
- Miss Parker, are you there?
[Sighs]
[Sobs]
Tell me about the Tommy you knew.
We met about a month before you did.
I was working construction
for one of his competitors-
a greedy contractor whose selfishness
cost a young man both his legs.
Tommy helped you take him down.
- Thomas was big on doing the right thing.
- Yeah.
I... have to know who killed him, Jarod.
As soon as I find out anything,
you'll be my first stop.
But until then, everything inside of me
says Rumor murdered Thomas.
Follow that lead.
And, Miss Parker, be careful.
Rumors can kill you.
[Beeps]
Parker?
- Tommy.
- Time to trust now, Parker.
- But-
- No. Trust Jarod.
Trust him.
[Broots]
That's funny.
"Centre Voting Booth.
Use handy lever to vote for most hated.
"One flush, Mr. Lyle.
[Laughing]
[Clears Throat]
"Two flushes, Mr. Raines.
Three flushes, Mr. Cox."
- Hey, I guess it's anybody's election.
- I'm flattered.
But I'd hate to be the one
to have to count the votes.
[Urinal Flushes]
Wouldn't you, Mr. Broots?
There are rumors going around,
Mr. Broots.
Rumors?
Well, you are a washer, I hope?
Oh, yeah. Always.
Before and after.
[Air Blowing]
So, uh- [Clears Throat]
what kind of rumors?
It's funny- these dryers bring back
fond memories of Father's mortuary.
We employed similar devices
in the preparation process.
Oh.
He used to let me help after school.
If I was good.
[Chuckles]
I guess even the dead
have to be clean.
Oh, yes, because...
cleanliness is truth.
Here. Please.
[Air Blowing]
You believe in truth,
don't you, Mr. Broots?
[Clears Throat]
Sure.
[Sighs]
So, uh...
about this Rumor thing,
I can explain-
Cleanliness is truth.
But that- that's kinda hot.
[Chuckles]
Just like the crematorium.
Now, what rumors are you
hearing, Mr. Broots?
Oh! [Groaning]
Oh, my God!
[Screaming]
[Sighs]
Oh, that feels good.
So, Broots, what did you tell Cox?
I screamed and told him
that my hand was frying.
About Rumor!
Well, as it turns out...
Mr. Cox wasn't interested
in the Rumor file at all.
He just kept coming back
to your father.
His persistent interest in your father
points to one thing.
Yes. That Cox is the hitter
hired by Mutumbo to kill Daddy.
And Brigitte, maybe,
as well as the baby.
I'm running out of time.
So is Daddy.
Anything further on Rumor, Broots?
Well, I was able to reach
the end of the phone tap archive.
And?
Nothing but a text message telling me
the identity of Rumor is in a hard copy file.
- Let's find it.
- No, no. I-I'm working on it.
It's, uh-
The file's called a Z3 File.
- Z3?
- Yeah.
Designates contract killings for hire.
Makes it a lock. Thomas was murdered
by someone inside the Centre.
- [Miss Parker] Thanks for
lending me your car, Broots.
- No problem.
Do you want me to stick around and keep
you company for a while, Miss Parker?
Mmm, thanks...
but I don't feel alone.
It must be pretty
hard still, though, huh?
Why does somebody have to die for us to
realize all the things we never said to them?
Well...
I guess it's 'cause we kinda treat life
like a bug on the sidewalk.
All we see is a bug,
not a miracle.
And no matter how hard we try...
we usually end up steppin' on it...
instead of takin' it into our hand.
And the living are...
left with all the unfinished business.
Until we finish it, yeah.
You know, between Thomas...
and everything that's
happening with your father...
I just want you to know that...
I'm here for you, Miss Parker.
I-I mean, if you need someone.
I-I mean, a friend.
Miss Parker?
The Z3 Rumor file?
How did it get in here?
It's not how it got here that matters.
It's who it says is Thomas's killer.
Who?
Revenge? You should think
about this, Miss Parker.
Think about what?
Tommy was murdered.
And his killer's gonna pay.
Thinking completed.
Miss Parker.
God help us all.
Be careful, Parker.
Tommy.
Open up, Bridget!
[Groans]
Angel.
- It's 4:00 in the morning.
- Where's Bridget?
- Oh, God, now where did she go?
- Don't try to cover for her!
Where the hell is she?
She was here when I fell asleep.
We had to leave our last hiding place.
Decided to sleep in the car.
- How did you find us?
- The car has a tracking system. Damn it.
She's been actin' nuts the last couple of weeks,
disappearing for hours at a time.
Oh, my God, angel.
She could be havin' the baby.
- Angel, what's happened? Why are you here?
- Thomas.
Rumor 5-8-2-5-9.
Oh, God.
Brigitte's Rumor.
- You knew nothing about this?
- Of course not!
She must have been
followin' Mutumbo's orders.
She killed Thomas.
I'm so sorry.
[Groans]
She's carrying my baby.
Daddy, think.
Where would she go?
Now that Mutumbo's dead,
she's not safe anywhere.
- No, everybody has a safe place. Think.
- What?
Well, there was a place.
Let's see, it was in the country, I think.
I never knew where. But she kept
a spare keyin her desk at the Centre.
I'll find it, and I'll find her.
Then what are you gonna do?
Think about my baby!
[Door Opens, Closes]
[Bell Dings]
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Searching. Why?
Because you're not the only one.
With Triumvirate pressure,
Cox has cranked up his search for Dad.
And if they find
any link to Mutumbo's death...
Parker will not be the safest surname
to have around here.
So, when did your boy Cox turn on you?
Like I tried to tell you before...
any link between Cox and me is a lie.
I intend to stay out of his crosshairs.
And I suggest you do the same.
[Bell Dings]
- Miss Parker?
- Broots!
- Mr. Cox and a team of Sweepers are-
- I heard.
- I need you to find something for me. A key.
- A key?
Yeah. A piece of metal with teeth on it.
You know, those of us that have evolved
beyond fire and wheels use it to unlock doors.
- Where is it?
- Bridget's office.
Brigitte?
[Phone Ringing]
- What?
- It was your eyes.
What was?
Where Thomas felt at home.
- Did he tell you that?
- Yes, he did.
Do you think he ever knew
what I really did?
I don't know.
But he knew who you were.
And to him, that was love.
He said the first time he ever experienced
that feeling was when he looked into your eyes.
[Exhales]
Miss Parker?
There were so many times
I wanted to tell him, to say it to him.
But I-
Tell him what?
It's too late now anyway, Jarod.
Never underestimate the importance
of completing unfinished business.
Oh, don't you worry. Bridget will
know the importance of that real soon.
So, Brigitte is the one
that pulled the trigger.
Like you didn't read the Rumor file
you left in my home.
Miss Parker,
I didn't leave you any file.
Whether it's love or revenge...
don't let unfinished business
finish you.
[Beeps]
- [Knocking]
- [Beeps]
- You found it!
- Yes. And what it opens, I think.
You see, I realized that if Brigitte
was intercepting Thomas's calls...
she had to have
them forwarded somewhere.
So I went to see Manny
to see if he could backtrack the calls.
He owes me a favor
'cause I loaned him my karaoke machine.
Follow the bouncing ball, Broots.
Well, all the calls were transferred
to a cabin less than 20 miles from here.
Here's the address.
Be sure and tell Manny the mute
that I said...
[Mouths Words]
"Thank you."
[Engine Off]
[Exhales]
I knew you'd come.
I'm havin' the baby.
[Exhales]
I heard a little rumor about you.
It's true.
Pull the trigger if you want.
God knows I deserve it.
You... have no idea.
Just answer one question.
Why did you kill Tommy?
- Orders.
- Who ordered it?
- [Grunts]
- Tell me who!
[Groaning]
Oh, God!
How far apart are your contractions?
Let's just say it won't be long
before you're a sister again.
Do what you want with me.
Just please let my baby live.
Oh, you've always had a knack
for stating the obvious.
The truth is,
it doesn't really matter anyway.
- This baby will even the score for you.
- The baby?
I have a disorder
called placenta previa.
I'll bleed to death
as the baby is born.
[Groaning, Inhaling]
[Groaning, Screaming]
- Uh-uh. I'll get help.
- [Dialing]
[Groans]
There's no signal out here.
[Groaning Continues]
Hold on!
I'll get help!
- The land line went dead
after I spoke to your father.
- You spoke with Daddy?
- He said you'd find the doctor
and bring him.
- Why did you run?
I knew it was just a matter of time
before you found out I was Rumor.
And with Mutumbo's hitter there,
I ran...
hoping to keep the focus
away from your father.
Despite what you think,
I love him very much.
[Screaming]
God!
[Gasps]
Oh! Oh!
[Gasps]
Oh!
Thank you.
Thank for not making me
do this alone.
# [Whistling]
- [Gasps]
- Putting in overtime?
I'm salary.
So is your friend, Manny.
The tongueless one?
The poor man drools when he speaks.
Sp-Speaks?
[Clears Throat]
About you, Mr. Broots.
Me?
Now, you have an opportunity
to tell me where Brigitte went.
Now, if you choose not to
accept that opportunity...
you could find yourself having more
in common with mute Manny than just karaoke.
- [Exhales]
- Shall I sing you a torch song?
Hmm?
[Groaning, Inhaling, Exhaling]
Stay with me, Bridget.
I'm here.
I'm sorry...
for Thomas.
For all the pain I caused you.
You never answered my question.
I don't know who.
But it wasn't the Triumvirate.
It came from inside the Centre.
They thought that
you were losing your focus.
Oh, God!
- Something's happening inside!
- Where's Daddy with the doctor?
- Stay with me now.
- I'm gonna faint.
No, you're not. No-
Oh, I can see the head. You need to push.
The head is blue.
- I can't.
- You can. Push.
The baby needs oxygen.
Push!
- How bad am I?
- Uh-
Uh, there's a lot of blood.
- I'm not gonna make it.
- Yes, you are, damn it!
I came here to kill you! I'll be the one
who decides whether you live or die!
- Now push!
- [Screaming]
- Push! Hold on! Help's here!
- [Helicopter Whirring]
[Screaming Continues]
[BabyCrying]
Oh! Oh!
[Crying Continues]
Brigitte?
Brigitte!
[Sobbing]
Oh, God. Oh.
[Lock Rattling]
- I see I'm too late for the Lamaze.
- But not too late to die.
No, no, angel.
He's on ourside.
Uh, Dr. Cox is here for the baby.
- Doctor?
- OB-GYN, Harvard '93.
[Scoffs]
Mmm.
[Coos]
Ahh.
Ooh. Aha.
This seals it.
The last piece.
[Chuckles]
Here you are, Nurse.
Don't forget the placenta
and cord blood.
Daddy, what's going on?
Mr. Cox has been
my inside man for months...
watching out
while I planned my return.
There's only one reason
for you being here, angel.
Did she admit to everything
in the Rumor file?
Damn lucky thing,
that file showin' up.
- She's gone.
- Mmm.
- Did you-
- Kill her? No.
She died in childbirth.
Aren't you even concerned
about your wife?
Till death do us part.
What-
She was nothing more than a vessel
for the baby, for your legacy.
Did you leave the Rumor file
in my house?
Now, why would I
do a thing like that?
Let me guess.
The gun that killed Mutumbo.
Found on her body.
Just clears everyone of everything.
She planted it in my stuff!.
It was a setup.
Rumor was tryin' to ruin both of us.
When are they gonna learn
they can't whip a Parker, huh?
Make it all go away.
- Daddy?
- What?
Don't you even want to know?
Know what?
If it's a boy or a girl.
I thought that getting revenge for Tommy's
death would somehow bring me peace.
But even if I had been able to,
I know now it wouldn't have.
[Jarod] That isn't the unfinished business
that needs finishing.
You said the other day
that you wish you had told him.
- Told him what?
- I never-
I never told Tommy that I loved him.
And now your heart and your mind
are raging a war against each other.
I would trade everything
for one minute with him.
Just to say those words
and have him hear them.
Tell him.
Let your heart win the war.
# [Pop]
# [Man Singing]
I love you, Tommy.
And I love you, Parker.

[TV: Man]
Good morning, Washington.
It's a sunny new day
here in the nation's capital...
but don't put away
those umbrellas just yet...
as there's a storm
moving up the seaboard.
The five-day forecast will follow
today's Washington Report.
[TV: Woman]
We're at Secret Service headquarters...
for today's Washington Report...
where officials are trying to piece together
the final hours of Todd Baxter...
a young agent whose body was recovered
from the Potomac River just last night.
Todd.
[Panting]
[Panting Continues]
[Man Shouting]
Jarod! Jarod!
Mike! Through here!
- Stop!
- [Shouting, Indistinct]
There he is! Get him!
Stop! Wait! Wait!
Will you help me, please?
My car is broken down and I need a ride.
- Please?
- All right. Hop in.
[Beeps]
Get me Mr. Parker.
The Pretender has escaped.
I'm free.
I'm Todd- Baxter.
- Jarod.
- Jarod.
- Got a last name?
- Just Jarod.
Just Jarod, huh?
How about them apples.
- [Chuckles]
- Apples?
I, uh- I don't know
how I can ever thank you.
Oh, just someday down the road
do somethin' nice for somebody.
The Secret Service is baffled
by the apparent suicide.
After just three-and-a-half short years
as an agent...
how did such a promising young man
end up dead in the Potomac?
A question that may never be answered.
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
[TV: Woman] More details emerging
in the apparent suicide...
of young Secret Service Agent
Todd Baxter...
who spent the final hours of his life
at this D.C. hotel, the River Glen.
Sources say he jumped
to his death in the Potomac...
after a night of drugs and depression.
However, friends and family we spoke with
say this is not the Todd Baxter they knew.
I'm gonna make a difference.
Does that sound hokey?
Hokey?
Is that a sporting event?
[Laughs]
Yeah.
Anyhow, all my life
I've known that, uh...
D.C.'s where things get done.
It's a tough town and all that...
but with smarts and hard work,
a guy can-
Change the world.
But what changed Todd Baxter?
Was it the pressure of life
inside the Beltway...
the demanding years
in the Secret Service?
The answers are through those doors.
[Radio: Dispatcher, Indistinct]
[Elevator Bell Dings]
- Agent Holder?
- Yeah?
- Special Agent Wilkes.
- Oh, right, right, right.
- The behavioral science guy.
- Yes, I just got in from the airport.
I bet you didn't have lunch, either, did you?
Here. You hungry?
"Cup O'Soup. A meal in a minute."
That's a rather clever idea, isn't it?
- Idea? Are you from the Seattle office
or Mars?
- Somewhere in between.
Well, I bet the boss
wants to see ya. Talbot.
He's got the place buzzing
over the Baxter thing.
- You knew Todd?
- Yeah. Can't believe he'd do
something like this.
Neither can I.
- Wilkes. Ellis Talbot.
- Sir.
Seattle faxed me
your papers this morning.
I could use a man with your expertise
about now. Follow me.
The maid called the D.C. cops this morning
and they called the Bureau.
F.B.I.'s running things.
Hoover boys are lookin'
at Baxter's body now.
From what I understand,
he'd been in the Potomac about a week.
He put a "Do Not Disturb"
sign on the door...
which is why it took the hotel people
so long to finally get curious.
[Holder]
Which fits with the rest of the story.
The night Todd checked in here,
witnesses downstairs say...
that he met up with an old girlfriend
in the bar, they came here for a little sex...
and a lot of heroin.
Has anyone questioned the girlfriend?
The feds are still looking for her...
but indications are she was long gone
before Todd went on his bender.
And jumped.
[Talbot] Demons like his, I sometimes wonder
if I ever knew the real Todd Baxter.
Sure you want to get out here?
Yes.
- This will be fine.
- All right.
Your car didn't really
break down, did it?
No.
Why did you help me?
My gut told me to trust you.
Wait a second.
There you go.
Oh, no. I-I couldn't possibly.
You've helped me too much already.
Forget it.
Have an ice cream cone on me.
Ice cream?
Is it good?
[Chuckles]
Yeah, it's very good.
Look, I don't know what cave
you've been livin' in, Jarod, but...
you're ever in D.C., look me up.
I will.
Thank you.
Jarod?
You two work with the feds if you have to,
but report only to me.
So what is it you're not telling me?
F.B.I.'s floating a theory that this was
a homicide. That's where you come in.
Baxter's suicide's embarrassing enough
without far-fetched speculation it was a murder.
You're the behavioral science expert.
Get them to see the truth
about Todd's psychological troubles.
The truth is all any of us want.
- Agent Ted Holder.
- Hi.
This is Special Agent Jarod Wilkes.
Bailey Malone,
Violent Crimes Task Force.
V.C.T.F. The Bureau's finest.
I brought the Baxter autopsy files.
You boys have some catching up to do.
- [Muttering]
- Daddy? I just heard.
Oh, there's nothin' to fear.
The doctors just want the baby
for observation.
Your little brother's gonna be just fine.
After all, you helped my new son
into this world,
got me back to my old desk.
I've never been more proud
to be your father.
Oh, you got that look in your eye.
- What lie has Jarod been tellin' you now?
- It's not Jarod.
It's me.
I don't know, it just-
[Sighs]
So much has happened
in the last few weeks.
Bridget dying,
you coming home, the new baby.
Ah, I understand. Yeah.
You want things to be diffierent.
Listen, come here.
Come here.
You must never lose your desire
to get Jarod back.
The new child is the future of the family,
but Jarod is the future of the Centre.
Why?
He's our greatest achievement,
our biggest asset.
However, consider your life
officially changed.
It's a brand-new day at the Centre.
- [Chuckles]
- [Kiss]
My attempts at cross-pollination
appear to be successful.
Very good.
Lies! Damn lies!
Lies!
[Jarod]
They finished the autopsy already?
Yes, it's all there in the report.
Oh, and get this-
Malone tells me they're not just thinking murder.
They're thinking signature killer.
- A signature killer?
- Yeah.
- Well, apparently their profiler
has a theory.
- Profiler?
- [Woman] That's me.
- [Knocking]
- Were you expecting someone else?
- Call it deja vu.
With a twist ending.
- Jarod Wilkes.
- Rachel Burke.
- Agent Ted Holder.
- Nice to meet you.
Not to be rude, but isn't your signature killer
theory a bit presumptuous?
Well, it's just that. It's a theory.
But there's evidence to support it.
- Like?
- Like our autopsy.
It confirms that Todd Baxter
did not die from a jump.
He was strangled to death.
Probably a piano wire.
And despite a week in the Potomac,
we found these.
- Ligature marks.
- On both wrists.
Not exactly consistent with suicide.
Not to be rude.
And he was drugged, and there is
evidence of sexual activity.
He may have a sexual need to be tied up,
maybe even asphyxiated.
[Phone Rings]
Or someone else tied him up.
Your signature killer?
- Yeah. It's just, uh-
- Instinct.
Somethin' like that.
They've located Todd's girlfriend,
an Emily Sadler.
I'd like to question her myself.
- I'll keep you in the loop.
- I look forward to that.
[Woman]
Todd and I met at Columbia.
I studied journalism,
and he was a criminology major.
What they say about Todd is true.
He was a really good guy.
But he had demons.
What kind of demons?
The kind he couldn't beat.
And this town made it worse.
I'd never seen him that wrecked.
- He was in a bad place that night.
- He had a drug habit, didn't he?
Yes.
It haunted him.
Did you try to help him?
Well, what do you think
I was doing that night?
That's why I went upstairs.
I was always tryin' to help him.
But then he pulled out the drugs,
and he started drinking.
And we started fighting.
Some things were said, so I left.
So you just... walked out.
Now that's my demon.
So, in your mind,
Todd Baxter was perfectly capable...
of jumping off that balcony?
Yeah.
He was always going too far.
That's the way he was.
Unless you know something I don't.
[Miss Parker]
This can't be right.
Sydney wouldn't have trashed these.
They're like therapy for him.
Ho-ho. Hello.
[Computer: Sydney]
Damn lies!
Always knew he was a mad scientist.
- The Centre does that to you.
- Go back to before he freaks out.
Oh.
[Miss Parker]
Angelo.
- Zoom in and freeze it.
- [Broots] It's a watch in a Centre bag.
Angelo must have dug it out
of the Centre archives.
And being an empath, he had to know
the effect it would have on Syd.
I hate seeing him like this.
[Exhales] How many black holes
has Sydney helped me out of?
Why didn't you come to me?
[Talbot]
You got 48 hours to find the truth.
The F.B.I. wants to chase theories,
they can do it till their badges fall off.
But I can tell you, I will not have
my division wasting resources on Agent Baxter.
- Tell Jerry we're in, please.
- Sir, he is one of our own.
That's not the issue.
This whole mess has put a spotlight on us,
and it's a bad one.
Are you suggesting
that the F.B.I. is lying?
No. I'm saying
Agent Baxter was lying.
For all we know,
a heroin dealer killed him.
It's bad enough that this didn't
show up on a background check.
- Now we have to find out the kid
had a million sick habits.
- A million and one.
Jerry Linden,
Office of Communications.
Special Agent Wilkes.
- Pleasure.
- If a reporter calls you, send him to Jerry.
Thank you, sir.
Do not leak this. It's not good.
Agent Baxter was arrested in college-
possession of heroin, intent to sell.
Well, I guess we'd better
just drop the case right now.
Case? You sound like the feds.
You got your 48 hours.
Then you're back in Seattle.
May I have this?
You've got it all on file.
We don't need this stuff
about Todd floatin' around.
Come on in.
The shredders in Seattle are smaller.
Secrets in D.C. are bigger.
You should see the size of the janitor's cart
they haul this stuff away in every Friday.
- Did Talbot put his personality
through that thing?
- [Chuckling]
Have a seat.
Let me tell you somethin' about Talbot.
You know all that crap about Boy Scouts
who run alongside the president's limo?
He doesn't just buy it.
He lived it for 25 years.
Todd Baxter would have too.
Tell me something.
If they were such good friends,
why did she walk out of that hotel room?
I don't know.
He had an addiction.
Sometimes walking's the only option.
[Screaming]
Emily!
[Yelling, Groaning]
Damn!
[Groans]
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
They said muggings were up,
but I had no idea.
Thanks.
I'm glad you're all right.
Thank you.
That wasn't a mugging.
I think you know that.
Why did you leave Todd
at the hotel that night?
What do you want from me? He was my friend.
It's not my fault he couldn't see that.
He was murdered, and someone is trying
to destroy what's left of his name.
I don't think you want that.
Why are you lying?
[Sighs]
I came to this town
to make a difference.
You sound like Todd.
- You knew him?
- He saved my life once.
[Sobs]
God, I miss him.
Then help me.
Help me protect his memory.
[Sighs]
Todd said he was meeting
someone at the hotel...
but he still had time to help me
with a problem I had at work.
That was Todd.
We had dinner and I left.
I hadn't heard from him
in a week, and then...
I see the news.
When they found his body.
I get this phone call.
The man on the other end knows where I live.
He knows where I walk my dog,
everything.
- He asked you to lie.
- He had the lie worked out.
It was scary.
I had to say that
it was sex and heroin.
Todd and I were best friends.
Just friends.
We were never together in his room
that night, and he never did drugs.
They said he was arrested
for possession in college.
A total lie.
The man on the phone threatened
to end my career. I didn't care.
Todd was my friend.
I told him I was gonna call the papers.
And then he told me
to check my mailbox.
That's my father.
They made me choose between
Todd's memory and my father's life.
I-
[Exhales]
You did the right thing.
You did the right thing.
Did Todd tell you
who he was meeting that night?
No. Uh-
[Emily] Allhe said was,
"I'm gonna be in the paper soon."
And then he tapped his briefcase.
Like there was
something important in it.
I want you to stay at my place.
You'll be safe there.
There's no safe place
from the monsters.
Todd said D.C. was like
a big masquerade ball...
only the people in disguise
were monsters.
If you want to make a difference,
you gotta pull off a few masks.
That's why he's dead, Jarod.
[Angelo]
No hope.
No hope.
What is "hope," Angelo?
Sydney lost hope.
Sydney lost hope.
- What does it have to do with that watch?
- Centre takes hope.
What did they take, Angelo?
Check Syd's file. It's a long shot,
but see if there's something about "hope."
Okay.
Mr. Parker takes hope from Sydney.
What does my father
have to do with this?
[Tires Screeching]
[Sobbing]
[Phone Ringing]
Hey, how about I cook you lunch?
No, thanks. I'll pass.
You have your vegetable,
your chicken noodle, your shrimp gumbo.
Shrimp almost tastes real.
Mmm.
Tempting, but no.
This better be good.
Todd Baxter tells his friend,
Emily Sadler...
that his name is about to be put
into the paper...
that he has something
important in his briefcase.
Three days later, Bill Radcliffi,
reporter, covers Secret Service
for the Washington Journal-
dies in a car accident.
An accident with one incongruous detail.
Ligature marks,
like those found on Todd Baxter.
I believe Baxter was going to meet this reporter
to expose something that he discovered.
And that "something"
was in his briefcase.
All we found was office paperwork.
What makes you so damn sure?
Let's just say that
I've gotten into the mind of the killer.
You've what?
Think about it. The killer wants
to cover up what Todd has discovered.
That's why he had
to kill the reporter too.
I don't think so.
The killer's into the act- the power
he exhibits over the helpless victim.
There's a purity in that violence.
It satisfies him.
I mean, if there is a cover-up,
someone else is calling the shots.
- Someone else?
- Yes.
- And this theory is based upon what?
- Hold on a second. Hold on.
There are two suspects?
You two might want to get on the same page.
You're running out of time.
Holder, come into my offiice.
You and I, we have to talk.
- Talbot could shut us down.
- Not me.
He could seal the evidence. It would take months
to reopen the case, even for the F.B.I.
- You and me, we have to work together.
- Yes, but not blindly.
But you can make these leaps of logic?
How does that work?
It's complicated.
Well, that isn't good enough.
There's evidence of a cover-up.
- Not by this killer.
- Then by who?
Todd Baxter was at that hotel room
to meet the reporter...
so he could expose the killer.
- Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe he needs to kill?
- "Needs to kill." No.
Maybe you ought to get into
his mind again. How does that work?
It's complicated.
[Exhales]
You know, Jarod, I think that under
different circumstances you and I-
Yes?
Still wouldn't have gotten along.
Is that so?
Well, for starters, you drink
processed powder and hot water.
You never know how tasty something's
going to be unless you try it for yourself.
Well, if we ever make it out of here,
I'm gonna show you what real food is like.
- I make an amazing bouillabaisse.
- Really?
Mm-hmm.
- Can you drink it out of a mug?
- You can drink it out of whatever you like.
[Chuckles]
You're lookin' for your family?
Yes.
They're out here somewhere.
I lost my dad when I was 10.
It's a tough age
to become man of the house.
- You grew up fast.
- Very.
But it taught me responsibility,
to always do the right thing.
And make sure others do too.
[Chuckles]
[Todd]
Make sure others do too.
[Emily] All he said was,
"I'm gonna be in the paper soon."
And then he tapped his briefcase.
[Jarod] Like there was
something important in it.
Doesn't make any sense.
You know, the thing I can't understand
about these papers, Jarod?
Why kill Todd over these?
They're all random, not connected.
Not even by a specific case.
It's like somebody just grabbed them.
To replace the ones
that were originally in his briefcase.
If somebody did switch 'em,
then Todd definitely had the goods on him.
The question is, who.
Hang in there, man.
We'll get him.
[Phone Rings]
- Agent Wilkes.
- It's Malone.
Listen, I went over those papers
you sent from Baxter's briefcase.
Nothing.
- However, I found something interesting.
- What?
That heroin charge against Baxter
from his college days?
- It's a fake.
- Yeah.
The campus cop
who arrested Baxter doesn't exist.
- Someone's trying to smear his past.
- I'll have to call you back.
[Dial Tone]
Let's take a walk.
Let me share something with you, Agent.
I'm under review, and I'm not inclined
to believe in a conspiracy...
but I know what city I'm in.
If this Baxter thing keeps goin' south...
we're gonna ruffle some feathers,
and we're gonna get clipped.
What about Todd Baxter?
Whose feathers did he ruffle?
What do you mean?
There was something in his briefcase
that someone didn't want exposed.
He also had heroin, barbiturates
and some fuzzy handcuffs.
The kid was messed up, Jarod.
I hired Baxter.
You think I want to believe this?
He was convicted of possession in college.
We should track down the arresting officer.
He already did.
You talked to the officer
that arrested him?
Yes. I would have rather not.
Trust me.
Jerry's seen the truth on this thing
from the beginning.
And I'm beginning to see it myself.
[Emily]
Linden switched the files?
Nice theory.
But you got no proof unless you find
the originals, and they're probably
long shredded by now.
Well, then it's time
to go digging through some trash.
[Glass Shattering]
- Typical shrink. Just flat nuts.
- Lies!
It was in a Centre evidence bag.
- Who did the watch belong to?
- I don't want to relive that.
Relive what?
We helped him.
It was awful.
Then get it out in the open.
It's a brand-new day at the Centre. Remember?
All right. Years ago,
Sydney killed a woman.
[Malone] Agent Wilkes.
Just the man I've been looking for.
What?
Nice working with you again.
A year ago, you worked with us on a kidnapping
in Atlanta. You used a different name.
Who the hell are you?
Who are you working undercover for?
Congress.
I work for an oversight committee...
that keeps tabs on local
and federal law enforcement.
That explains your badge in Atlanta.
What brought you to the Service?
The committee smelled a rat
in the Baxter case.
They sent me down.
Still doesn't answer all my questions.
I'll answer any question you want.
But right now, I found Todd Baxter's killer,
and I need your help to get him.
Syd killed a woman?
In a car accident. It happened during
the early stages of the Jarod Project.
Syd hired a college intern
from France, a young girl.
[Broots Exhales]
She was pretty.
Apparently, they were having an affiair.
They'd gone to dinner and were driving back
when Sydney lost control and broadsided a tree.
She died two hours later in the hospital.
- Her name was Hope?
- Claudia.
When Angelo said Sydney
lost hope, he meant it.
Now, these are
the Centre records of the accident.
I'm hoping that'll help us find Syd.
Provence Restaurant.
This must be where they dined before-
- Worth a try.
- Yeah.
- Did you glue this together?
- Yeah.
It's all 6,422 strips.
- After that, I got bored.
- Mmm. Yeah, well, Baxter certainly wasn't.
Between these articles and those
confidential memos you pieced together...
Baxter connected Linden to numerous
illegal operations and other so-called suicides.
Todd was definitely
trying to make a difference.
- How about those apples?
- Them apples.
- Hmm?
- It's "How about them apples?"
Oh. I knew it was
something about apples.
Bailey told me who you worked for.
They the ones who showed you
how to get into a killer's mind?
No. That was more home schooling.
That's some home.
You don't want to know.
Well, I decided not to wait.
Try this.
- Is this your bouillabaisse?
- Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Mmm!
How do you have time to track a killer
and make something this delicious?
Well, we all have our secrets.
Don't we, Jarod?
It only helps until the next morning.
And, uh, I'll be back then.
We know about the accident, Syd.
Look, I'm here with
some of my favorite ghosts.
Can't you see?
So leave me alone.
You wouldn't let us off that easy,
so forget it, Sydney.
It wasn't your fault.
You have to let Claudia go.
I can't.
We're celebrating.
Why?
Because.
Because they used her against me.
Syd, the Centre helped you.
The Centre sure helped.
They were there
right after the accident.
Centre Sweepers yelling...
"Oh, we'll give Claudia the best care."
And then...
two hours later...
I got the news.
I gave her this watch
for her birthday.
It would have been yesterday.
How did Angelo know about-
[Chuckles]
Angelo.
How does Angelo know about anything?
He knew that you need
to deal with this pain, Syd...
that you were in love with her.
That wasn't Angelo.
- They told you that.
- That's what my father said.
That's what the file said.
- Centre lies!
- Careful, Sydney.
Oh, no, much later, when I found out
what the Centre was doing with Jarod's work...
and I rose up in protest-
They used the accident against you?
I did love her.
Like my daughter.
She was my student.
But the Centre fabricated some story
of an affiair between us.
They threatened me with jail.
- They threatened-
- To separate you from Jarod.
Yes. They used it
to force me to do their bidding.
Not only was Claudia dead, but they
tried to destroy the very memory of her.
My father did this to you?
Not directly, of course.
But, yes, Mr. Parker
was running the Centre.
Now have a shot.
[Jarod]
Todd Baxter knew too much.
He connected Linden
to several major illegal operations-
character assassinations, extortion...
among other clandestine things.
Your director of communications has had
six Washington jobs in the last seven years.
Yeah. Travel office, D.O.J. cover-up,
framed a D.O.E. whistle blower.
Watergate plumbers
got nothin' on this guy.
Hasn't paid this well since G. Gordon Liddy.
His offshore accounts are packed.
Agent Baxter found out,
and that crafty son of a bitch killed him.
Made it look like a drug overdose
so I'd shut down the case.
- He played me.
- Except Linden isn't the killer, is he, Rachel?
Are you two reading
each other's minds now?
Murder is not in Linden's profile.
He likes to control the truth, but only from
the background. He was never in that hotel.
- Think he had someone do
his dirty work for him?
- Mm-hmm.
- All right. When do we move?
- [Both] We don't.
There's a killer out there, and Linden
is going to lead us right to him.
Daddy, the Centre did this.
You did this.
You forgot. The Triumvirate gave the orders.
I carried them out.
- I knew you would say that.
- I don't like your attitude.
Daddy, please.
I just want Sydney to have some closure.
[Sighs]
It can be arranged.
- [Intercom Beeps]
- Mr. Morgenstern.
[Gasps]
Claudia.
[Speaking French]
[French]
Oh, Sydney.
[French Continues]
When you told me what Sydney
was going through, I had her flown in.
She's a groundbreaking psychiatrist
at a teaching hospital outside of Paris.
A hospital funded by the Centre.
After the accident, she healed up quickly.
We gave her a future, a career.
And told her that Sydney was dead.
Well, that's one order
I wish I'd never taken.
Angel, a new life changes everything.
I told you.
It's a brand-new day.
- [Rings]
- Communications. Linden.
[Jarod]
I'm watching you.
Who the hell is this?
I'm the man you hired
to throw Todd Baxter out the window.
- Baxter committed suicide.
- No.
You hired me to kill him, didn't you?
I'll take that as a "no comment."
If you care to explain yourself,
off the record...
meet me at the River Glen Hotel...
room 814.
Hello?
Hello? Anyone here?
You don't think I'd be foolish enough
to be armed, do you?
I'm about to find out
how big a fool you are.
Agent Wilkes.
- So what is this?
- It's the River Glen Hotel.
Not exactly the Watergate,
but scandals can be made here as well.
Well, I sure hope you brought your wallet
so you can buy your freedom.
Innocent men don't need to.
[Jarod] These documents
that I stole from your office-
they seem to say otherwise.
Well, aren't you industrious.
Fabrications designed
to destroy an honest man.
Like the ones you create?
Like the ones
that Todd Baxter discovered?
You make a fortune creating scandals
that ruin people's lives...
even end them.
Jarod, if you're trying to get me
to make a verbal admission...
for something I know nothing about...
for you or...
whoever else is watching-
Damn it.
I'm afraid you got the wrong fool.
[Sighs]
You're right.
I am a fool for ever believing
you could possibly just tell the truth.
- We're done here.
- Oh, we are just...
getting started.
- We'd better get in there.
- No, just give him a minute.
- I wouldn't want you to miss it.
- Miss what?
Your suicide.
[Gasps]
[Grunts]
[Sighs]
# [Whistling]
What are you doing?
I'm setting the scene...
just like the man you hired
to kill Todd Baxter did.
[Groans]
I'm gonna make it seem
like you had an evening of... drugs.
Then you took a swan dive
out the window.
Hope they find your body sooner.
- No, wait. Wait! No!
- Mmm. No waiting.
No! No!
[Grunts]
Who did it? You tell me
who killed Todd Baxter...
or they'll be fishing your body
out of the Potomac-what's left of it.
- I can pay you. Just forget about Baxter.
- Money?
- Yeah.
- Todd Baxter saved my life!
- You killed him. I'm gonna even the score!
- No! You're crazy.
Plan "B." Plan "B."
Go to plan "B"!
What are you doing?
You warning your accomplice?
You tell me who killed him,
or I will drop you out of this window!
Holder. Agent Holder.
- Where is he?
- He's in the service elevator
at the end of the hall.
- Get up!
- No! No! No!
- Good luck.
- Yeah, you too.
Is this more bouillabaisse?
No, I only had 30 seconds.
It's chicken noodle.
- [Laughs]
- The chicken almost tastes real.
Mmm.
That's why you're undercover.
You're alone in this world.
We all have secrets.
No family?
No one to get close to?
Not yet.
I should get back to the office.
Jarod. This-This was more
than just a case for you.
Why?
Let's just say I was helping out...
an old friend.
Well, if you ever need a new friend,
you can call me.
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
At least Jarod could have led us
to a place near the Strip...
then I could have
hit the craps table.
[Clears Throat] Well, hit this instead:
single malt, like you asked for.
And you're forgetting something.
Jarod didn't lead us here.
His friend told him to stay here
in an e-mail I intercepted.
- He's been compromised this time,
and he's gonna walk right into our hands.
- My hands.
- Now go to your room.
- Oh, this is my room. Our room.
This is the honeymoon suite.
- Not even after four of these.
- Oh, no, no. Miss Parker, it's perfect.
Why do you think Sydney and Lyle
are coming tomorrow? If Jarod came here...
and he saw a woman and three men
on the register, well,
he'd- he'd know we're here.
This way, if-
if you and I pretend...
to be the honeymoon couple,
well, he'd be none the wiser.
- This was your idea.
- Yeah.
I mean, it's a good one, isn't it?
Nobody'd believe you and Syd.
He's- He's middle-aged,
and he's Flemish.
And you, you're young and- unless you think
that you'd rather room with Lyle.
Centre's a sick place but-
but your own brother?
Relax, Romeo.
That's as far as I go.
Take first watch. Anybody pulls into
that parking lot, send up a flare.
- Okay.
- Broots?
Fall asleep,
it'll be a hell of a wedding night.
[No Audible Music]

[Jarod Narrating]
Welcome to Sin City- Las Vegas, Nevada.
A Pretender could win big here-
some other Pretender.
I've been rolling nothing
but snake eyes.
I should be having some fun in the sun,
and all I got is... frostbite.
- They say luck is a lady.
That must be good luck.
- [Shivering]
- Bad luck is definitely a man,
and he dresses funny.
- [Teeth Chattering]
Argyle tried to sell me to the Centre
a couple of years back.
Last year he almost got me killed.
- [Sneezes]
- Why should this year be any different?
- [Whimpers]
- Some days it doesn't pay
to answer your e-mail.
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
[Jarod Narrating]
Look at me. Some genius.
I wish I could pretend myself
into some longjohns.
But in my own defense, this all started
when Argyle decided to become a Pretender.
As usual, his mouth was writing checks
his brain couldn't cash.
Hello?
Hello?
Ha! Prepare to die,
you mamaluke. Ow! Ooh!
Ah! Hey! Hey!
[Grunts]
- J-Man! You made it.
- Argyle, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, J-Dog. You saw the door.
This is a dangerous business.
And when you're the mac daddy
of private dicks...
the flyin' monkeys- all they wanna do
is put you on the night train to Emerald City.
You're lucky you didn't get your ticket punched,
Richard Dixon, private investigator.
- Oh, no. I ain't Dick Dixon. I'm his partner.
- So why did you e-mail me?
Why don't you get him to help you?
Oh. Well, you see,
this ain't Double "D's" kind of gig.
This is what we in the industry
call a "multifacetal" type thing.
See, there's a lot of
cross-purposing entities, multicultural...
purposes, you know-
all of that and what not.
- Good-bye, Argyle.
- No, no, no! Wait! J-Dog. J-Dog.
You can't leave me.
You can't leave. You're all I got, man.
I'm in trouble, Jarod. Please.
[Jarod Narrating] Raymond Chandler
hada secret for writing detective stories.
"When in doubt," he said,
"have somebody enter the room with a gun."
Okay, it's an ice-cream cone.
But it was pistachio...
and I'm allergic to pistachios.
- You Dick Dixon?
- Me? No. I'm his partner. That's Dick Dixon.
- Oh! Ow!
- Think that hurt? Taste this.
[Jarod Narrating]
Let's call this story "Death by Double Dip."
Now, our pistachio-packing
friend will have to wait...
since the Pretender
is now Dick Dixon, private eye.
Let me give you the skinny. Argyle's new job
was another epic work of fiction.
Dick Dixon isn't even around anymore.
He skipped town last year
buried in debt.
Argyle had only become his partner
a week earlier.
He was working the building
as a "hospitality technician."
And that's what he called it.
I call it "janitor."
He happened to be scrubbing Dick Dixon's
abandoned office when... she walked in.
I'm looking for Dick?
Excuse me?
- You know- Dick.
- Dick?
- Dick Dixon?
- Oh. Oh. Dick Dixon.
Uh, yeah.
Um, no. He's gone.
- Gone?
- Yeah. He took the slow boat to China.
[Spoken Lyric]
...that kind of thing.
- Do you work for him?
- Do I work for him?
- Yeah.
- Do I work for him? I am his nom de plume.
I'm his coup de grace. I am
his comrade-in-arms, you know what I'm sayin'?
- I am his partner, for Pete's sake.
- Um, you do his dirty work?
That's funny.
This mop- you see- I'm undercover.
I'm what we in the industry
call the "clandestinal" partner.
Whatever Dick wants, Argyle gets Dick.
"Argyle." That's an interesting name.
Yeah. My parents gave it to me
on account of my birthmark.
Hey, would you like to see
my birthmark?
- No.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry. I-
- [Sobs]
- I get that a lot. Please don't cry.
I hate to see a girl cry.
Here. Take this. There you go.
That's all right.
- Say, what's your name?
- Mona.
- Like the Lisa?
- Yeah.
- That's very beautiful.
- [Blows Nose Loudly]
Listen, Mona. I can help.
Talk to me.
Well, I'm a showgirl
down at the Club Ali Bar...
and my boss is in trouble.
Trouble?
What's your boss's name?
- Dirty Willy.
- He doesn't bathe?
No. People just call him that.
He's a good man, takes care of us,
and all the girls have comprehensive dental.
- Wow. That's key.
- And this bucket of quarters
is all he's got left.
And he told me to give this
to Mr. Dixon.
Okay.
I will get this to Mr. Dixon.
- Willy knows things, Mr. Argyle-
- Oh, yeah?
things that he shouldn't know.
- He needs protection.
- Consider it done, Ms. Lisa.
- Argyle is on the case.
- [Giggles]
[Jarod Narrating]
"Argyle is on the case"-
five words to send
a chill down your spine.
Argyle embraced the cliche,
casting himself in the starring role...
of a big-time private eye extraordinaire.
Determined to help Mona, he made
his way back into the Club Ali Bar...
and, like a true detective,
was looking for clues-
anything he could find that would lead him
to where or what happened to Dirty Willy.
But he wasn't ready to be a star.
As soon as things got real,
Argyle wished he'd taken a bit part.
[Argyle Gasps]
Dirty Willy.
He'd done the job, solved the case.
He had the killer cornered.
- So Argyle did what Argyle does best.
- [Gasps]
- He never saw the hit man.
Who could at that speed?
- Woah!
He was pretty sure the killer
didn't see him- pretty sure.
Which brings us back
to our pistachio-packin 'porker.
He was wondering
the same thing as me.
- Where the hell is Mona?
- Well, I -I -I don't know.
She told me she was comin'
to see you, Dixon. And now she's gone?
- Did she say where she was goin'?
- She hasn't told me anything.
- Did she leave anything?
- Look. Normally, I don't talk
to gun-wielding thugs.
Yeah. Your mama must be real proud
of you now, eh, big boy?
No. She'd probably give me a lickin'.
My mama's dead.
Truth is, I'm not a thug.
My name is Mike. I'm Mona's brother.
- Oh. Hi, Mike.
- Hi.
[Sighs] It just ain't like her not to check in.
Our parents died when we were real little...
and I made a promise to Mom
that I'd take care of Mona.
- I just gotta know if she's okay.
- [Sighs]
You will. Just as soon as we find out
anything, you'll be the first to know.
- I promise. Right, partner?
- Yeah.
Dick Dixon is on the case,
kickin' tail and takin' names.
You are Mr. Positivi-tivity,
the Shah of "I Can." Hey, now. Swell ride.
Like I always say,
private dick's gotta have a ragtop.
- You are not going.
- What are you talkin' about?
I am not a detective. You are not my partner.
If I'm going to help, you stay outta my way.
That was extremely hostile.
I can't keep saving your life
if you keep lying yourself into a corner.
- You have to think.
- [Engine Starts]
- Hey!
- [Engine Stops]
- I've been thinkin'.
I was-
[Spoken Lyric] till I met you.
Now after you helped me and Pop last year,
I'm mendin' my wicked ways, you know.
I ain't had nothin'
but honest jobs since.
Only thing missin' is the love of my life.
And I met her last week.
- Mona's the one.
- You spent six minutes with her.
360 glorious seconds, J-Man.
Somethin' happened between us, I'm tellin' ya.
It was like "electronical" chemicals
or something.
Pheromones, baby,
I'm tellin' ya.
And now my future brother-in-law's
weepin' in his pistachio.
You gotta let me come with you, J-ster.
You gotta let me help her.
J-Man. J-Dog.
Please, I'm beggin' ya.
Please, please, please,
please, please.
There are certain times in life when you need
to think with your heart, not your head.
This wasn't one of those times, but I thought
it was, so I made the following mistake.
- Please?
- Get in.
Yeah, yeah.
- [Engine Starts]
- Argyle is on the case. Come on!
How did I get in this nightmare?
Well, I-I remember
I was watching out for Jarod...
and you looked at me with bedroom eyes,
like you wanted to do the late-night creep.
I did not. We did not.
Well, how can you be sure,
Miss Parker?
For starters, pigs aren't flying,
hell hasn't frozen over...
and you're not the last man on earth.
[Rings]
- What?
- How's the stakeout going?
Sydney, how are you?
I... am fine.
Sweeper team says you haven't reported in.
Huh. Something came up.
I... overslept, but-
but I was just getting dressed.
I'll be there tomorrow
with Lyle and Raines.
Parker, is everything all right?
I am rolling nothing but sevens.
[Chuckles]
[Quietly]
You so much as hint at this
when they arrive...
I will amputate your head.
- Well, what about this?
- There is no "this."
Nothing happened, Broots.
Like I said, it was a nightmare,
and I'm glad I woke up.
When you say things like that,
do you even consider my feelings?
What is it about me
that you find so repulsive?
- You really want to know?
- Yes. I really want to know.
Okay.
Now you shut up and listen.
What I find so utterly uninspiring
about you...
is your idea of risk
is to go without deodorant.
When the bullets stop flying,
you're always the one shaking in the corner.
That, in the game of life,
is second string.
And-
[Spoken Lyric]
Hey. Stop, and let me tell
you something, and you-
you shut up and listen.
You're right.
I have never taken a risk.
Because the whole time I've known you,
I've only wanted to take just one.
Which one would that be?
You're in your office.
It's late, and I sneak in.
In one hand I have gardenias, and in the other
I have a bottle of single malt-
two of your favorite things
in the world.
And I find that little spot
on the nape of your neck...
and I just...
rub it the right way...
to get rid of that migraine you always get
about 6:20 every night-
the one you never tell
anyone about.
The truth is, if I had just one shot...
you know what I'd do?
I would take your pain away.
Truth is, you'd be lucky
to get a scrub like me.
- Do you hear that, Broots?
- What?
Pigs are flying.
# [Man Singing Slow Jazz]
[Both Moaning]
[Miss Parker Squeals, Giggles]
[Jarod Narrating] Life is strange.
One hour in the Nevada sun,
and I had more unanswered questions
than the Warren Commission.
- # [Continues]
- There was Dirty Willy's murder to solve...
and Mona, the missing showgirl,
to track down.
But Argyle had to see his father, Benny.
The old man used to be obsessed with the pope.
I was about to find out he converted.
Wayne Newton is more than a holy man.
He is the shaman of the Strip.
He's the duke of downtown.
- Wayne Newton is Las Vegas.
- If you say so.
You know, I met him once, sort of?
My Adella and I, uh,
saw him in Vegas long ago.
Who'd have thought
I'd be back here in Vegas with Argyle...
livin' in this exquisite golfvilla?
[Man, In Distance]
Fore!
- Driving range is open.
- [Man] Sorry.
Yeah.
The only one missin' is my Adella.
This week would've been
our 50th anniversary.
She was my inspiration, Jarod.
She's the reason I'm writin'
a song for Wayne.
- Hey, Pop, we-we don't have time for that.
- Oh, sure we do.
The big "W," he changed our lives...
so my Adella suggested
that I should write him a song...
sort of a companion piece
to "Danke Schoen."
She said,
"Call it 'AufWiedersehen"'...
and here goes nothing.
# [Introduction]
# [Ends]
- Where's the song?
- It's still a work in progress.
It'll be ready by tomorrow.
- What's happening tomorrow?
- Uh, Wayne is playin'
in a charity tournament...
and he will be right there putting...
and I will be right here standing-
# When I hit him
with the razzamatazz #
You know, I've never actually played golf,
but, um, won't that disturb his game?
Oh, yeah.
Well, yeah, but it's worth it
for my Adella's last wish, isn't it?
It's more than worth it.
- Yeah. Good.
- And the big "W" will love it, Pop...
but we gotta get out of here.
We gotta catch ourselves a killer.
- I got me a song to write.
- Catch you later, Pop.
[Jarod Narrating] It was nice
to see Benny again, but Argyle was right.
We did have a killer to catch.
So we went back to the scene of the crime.
Okay.
Uh, Dirty Willy bought it right about here...
and I saw the killer
standing right over there.
Hey, funny face,
this area's off limits, all right?
I got top-notch talent
makin' their way through here...
to the most glorious stage
in Las Vegas...
and I can't have you
or that thing you call a suit in the way.
- Let me explain.
- No. There's no explainin' that,
and who the hell are you?
- My name is Dick Dixon.
- You're Dick Dixon?
- Oh!
- You slept with my wife, you scumball!
- I don't even know your wife.
- Thrifty Suites, number 38. Ring a bell, pumpkin?
Hey, hey, hey, half-pint, this ain't about
your old lady givin' room service, all right?
- We're tryin' to find Mona Jeffries.
- Yeah, well, I ain't seen her.
What are you gonna do about it, tough guy?
[Yelps]
You see that?
There goes my Chivas.
- Where'd you learn how to do that?
- I ran a dojo once.
- Now tell us what you know.
- Okay. I'll tell you what I told
the cops, all right?
Mona ain't your typical showgirl,
all right? She-
She won't show her cones,
and she saves her dough. [Yelps]
- She bought a condo outside of town.
- Where?
[Yelps]
Okay! God! I'll tell ya! Geez!
- I got your back, J-Man.
- Oh, that's very comforting.
Either my Mona's real messy, J-Man,
or somethin' real bad happened to her.
You can stop right there.
Let's see some I.D.
- The I.D.'s out in the car.
My name is Dick Dixon.
- You're Dick Dixon?
- Yes.
- You slept with one of our deputies.
She left the force 'cause of you.
I seem to have that effect on people.
- What happened here?
- Been a while since you cracked
your detective handbook, huh?
We got a report ofa disturbance.
Door was jimmied, place had been trashed...
but her car keys,
purse and valuables are still here.
- Mona was leaving?
- No. She was kidnapped.
[Knocking]
- You gonna get that?
- [Knocking Continues]
Those are the late-night creepers.
- It is the honeymoon suite.
- [Knocking]
[Door Closes]
- [Faucet Turns, Water Running]
- [Martial Arts Grunts]
[Imitating Elvis]
Oh, yeah. Thank you very much.
- Oh, Syd. You're here early. [Clears Throat]
- I thought something was wrong.
- [Water Running Continues]
- Oh, no. No.
No. As a matter of fact,
Things are gonna be different from now on.
- [Water Stops]
- Broots, you are gonna pay for...
using all the hot water, you moron!
You were saying, Broots?
Syd, please tell me
you're here to relieve me.
Being cooped up with Felix Ungar here
makes me glad to see your sorry mug.
Lyle and I are registered at Caesars.
Separate rooms?
- Well, separate suites.
- [Scoffs]
[Sydney] Lyle will be here later.
Perhaps we can take over.
Hopefully, I won't have plugged Broots
before then. Call me when he gets here.
- What?
- I thought things were gonna
be different between us.
There is no "us."
At least...
not that they know of.
Could you imagine
what they would do if they knew?
Right. Right. We don't- We don't wanna
give them any ammunition, now do we?
Speaking of which...
my clip is empty.
Oh, yeah. I get it, baby.
But if we're gonna do this-
[Whispering] we gotta do it right.
I've always had a little fantasy
I want to live out with you.
But first I want you to call me...
"Puff Daddy."
Say it. Say it.
- Puff-
- [Inhales] Daddy.
Oh!

[Jarod Narrating]
They say that life is stranger than fiction.
Mine certainly has been,
and this was no exception.
Mona was kidnapped, but by whom?
Whatever trouble her boss, Dirty Willy, found,
it had certainly found her...
and it was only a matter of time
before it found us.
I did what Syndey always taught me:
When in doubt, go back to the evidence.
A couple of things just don't make any sense.
According to the autopsy report...
what killed Dirty Willy
was low levels of oxygen in his tissues...
due to hypothermia- extreme cold.
He froze to death.
In Vegas?
And he had several ice pick holes
in his hands.
I'm thinkin' torture.
Wait a second, J-Man.
You don't think who's ever doin' this
might, you know...
- poke Mona like that?
- Let's hope not.
According to this file,
he is the number one suspect:
Constantin Falzone-
an extortionist for the Posavac crime family.
What other part of your two-plus-two case
don't add up to four?
[Jarod]
Dirty Willy weighed over 300 pounds.
Frozen or not, that's a lot of Willy
for one man to carry around.
- Wait. What are you sayin', "J"?
- There were two killers...
who tortured Dirty Willy
and froze him to death.
Question is,
what did they want out of him?
[Exhales]
That's easy, baby- cash, do-re-mi, J-Man.
Everybody knows
Falzone collects around town...
so maybe Dirty Willy
couldn't come up with the green...
and the twins get P.O.'d with him.
- Twins?
- Falzone's got these Frigidaires
that work for him.
- Calls 'em his caddies.
- Caddies? Why?
[Jarod Narrating]
Falzone- Sin City old-timer.
Doesn't care about shopping malls,
pirate ships or the Eiffel Tower in the desert.
He's only interested in cash...
and a three handicap.
J-Rod, those two goons killed Dirty Willy
and kidnapped my Mona.
I say we waste 'em and snag Falzone.
No. We meet Falzone out there
on his own turf.
But you don't know how to play.
It's all geometry and physics.
How hard could that be?
[Narrating] Sydney always taught me,
the most difficult Pretends
have an inner secret.
Once you reveal that secret,
it comes naturally.
- [Club Hits Bushes]
- [Bird Squawking]
[Dog Barks]
In 56 minutes, I found the secret
to a perfect golf game.
I'll share it with you sometime.
The twins were impressed,
just like I said.
Falzone wanted to take me on.
- Then I told them I was Dick Dixon.
- [No Audible Dialogue]
Guess which one's married.
The twins promised to get us to Falzone,
which they did.
However, in true Chandleresque fashion,
we found out it was with a twist.
Someone else had gotten to him first.
And to think I wasted 56 minutes.
Raymond Chandler always said,
"The best way to get a reader's attention
is with a dead body."
But of course,
Chandler wasn't writing this one.
[Gasping]
I got balls!
[Splashing]
I got balls.
Unbe-friggin-lievable.
People actually throw these away.
- And that makes them yours.
- Possession is 9/10ths.
You oughta know.
I hear Dick Dixon steals wives.
And I hear you hang Dirty Willys.
And now you've kidnapped Mona Jeffries.
How come I get the feeling
you cheat at golf?
If you're not cheating,
you're not playing.
- Hey, we want Mona back.
- Who are you- Little Dick?
All right. I'll show you little,
ya big freak.
Hey. Dirty Willy never came up short,
so there's no reason to kill him.
As for Mona,
a Viagra-poppin' man such as myself...
can only pray to enjoy a muffin
like that in the morning.
All right. That's it. You and me gonna throw
right now, paisan. I had it with this mook.
Hey. I got no beef with Dirty Willy.
I got no beef with you, Dixon.
Mona asked me for help. She said
that Dirty Willy was gettin's queezed...
by, um, a couple of goons
by the name of the Frost Brothers.
- [Together] The Frost Brothers?
- The Frost Brothers.
Now I got my finger in every casino
in this whole town. I never heard
of these guys.
Okay? So that's it. That's all I know.
All right? Are we done? Are we done?
- Let's go.
- Let's go.
Give me my balls.
# [Humming]
Room service.
I was just talkin' to the manager.
You won't believe what he was telling me.
- And what would that be, Mr. Broots?
- Glad you could join us.
[Raines] Centre employees
of opposite genders don't room together.
Just show him.
Taken by a security camera
at McCarran International Airport.
It's of Jarod heading for the runway.
He skipped town.
Your theory isn't holding.
It's time to go home.
No, but the- the e-mail said
that he was gonna be here. W-We have to stay.
- Broots, it's over.
- No. I just talked to the manager.
He took a reservation last night
under the name of "Jarod Siegel"-
as in "Bugsy Siegel,"
the man who created Vegas.
A reservation
doesn't mean he's gonna show.
- We're leaving.
- We're staying.
Did he just ignore us?
You wanna barge in here
and try and scare me? You go ahead.
But don't question my skills.
I'm not second string anymore.
I do a job, and I do it well.
And if your paranoid minds can't take that,
then you can go chase that photo.
Miss Parker and I will catch Jarod.
Enjoy your breakfast.
[Wheels Squeaking]
You better hope we catch Jarod,
or we're through.
- You mean us?
- I mean our necks.
[Jarod Narrating]
As Argyle and I drove back to Benny's...
we knew that without the mysterious
Frost Brothers, there was no Mona...
and no dream for Argyle.
But Argyle 's dream
wasn't the only one in jeopardy.
- Oh, those bastards. Bastards, all of them!
- Benny, what happened?
There I am.
I am standing there in the bunker.
I am halfway into my "overature,"
and they grab me.
- Wayne's bodyguards.
- Oh, bite your tongue. Wayne's people...
would never do that with a rake.
Ah, it was those lowlifes that work for
the other half of Wayne's threesome-
those "mugicians" with the big hair?
It's a good thing
they didn't bring their tigers, boy.
- Whew.
- So Wayne never heard your song?
No. And I know he would've loved it.
He would've loved it.
Of course he would have.
- What's the matter with him?
- We haven't found Mona yet.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
It's always a girl, isn't it?
Let me let you in
on a little tiny secret.
He's just exactly like me.
- No.
- Oh, yes. I was wild. I was unchecked...
until my Adella tamed me.
I still remember that trip to Vegas.
We wanted to get away from it all.
Dr. Kanapa had told us that
we wouldn't be able to have a family...
and I know it was really tough for her.
But my Adella-
God, she looked so beautiful
the night we went to see Wayne.
Ya never saw a polka dot dress
like that in your life.
Well, big Wayne-
he picks her out of the whole crowd...
and he sang "Danke Schoen" right to her.
- It was-
- Like a dream.
Yeah. That night,
Adella came back to the motor court...
all giddy from Wayne's show, you know?
And we drove the cattle across the prairie
all night long, if you catch my meaning...
and... we were blessed.
- You conceived Argyle.
- Rolled a hard eight. [Chuckles]
- [Benny] So now, when I see him
goin'through all this-
- [Dog Whimpers]
I think, "Where would I be today
if it weren't for my Adella?"
She was your Mona.
[Sighs]
Jarod...
ya gotta find that girl for my boy.
[Dog Whimpers]
[Jarod Narrating]
It seems everybody who met Mona wanted her:
Argyle, her brother, Falzone.
It got my detective gears spinning.
Look, buddy boy.
I followed her home once- okay, twice.
Nick had known everything about Mona:
where she lived, how she saved her money.
Maybe he knew
who the Frost Brothers were.
- But I swear, I never heard of
the Frost Brothers.
- It was almost a dead end.
- Almost.
- Dixon.
Deputy Wyatt hadn't punched me
the first time we met.
Guess he figured I was due.
- Oh, this is gettin' really old.
- You tryin' to destroy three months
of real police work?
- We almost got Falzone for extortion.
- So get him.
After you talked to him?
You of all people should know...
there's only one way
to do things in this town: the Vegas way.
What about the Frost Brothers way?
- What's that place got to do with anything?
- Place?
- Place?
- Place?
Place. It's an abandoned meat-packing plant
outside town. So what?
[Dog Barking, Whimpers]
Mona?
Mona?
[Whimpering, Barks]
Mona?
Mona! Mona!
- Mona.
- I didn't think you'd come.
- Oh, you're so cold.
L-Let's get you out of here.
- Argyle, these two guys-
They had masks on.
They grabbed me.
They've been trying to get me to tell them
what Dirty Willy told me.
But I can't tell them that secret,
'cause I can't do that to Willy.
- Well, you could tel I us the secret, Mona.
- Tell us later.
We have to get out of here right now.
Yeah. We need to get you back
to your brother.
Brother?
I don't have a brother.
- Sure you do. Two of'em.
- [Barks]
- [Dog Growling]
- Argyle, say hello to the Frost Brothers.
[Continues Growling]
[Jarod Narrating]
It was a case to make Ray Chandler proud.
Let's review.
Our two sheriff deputies, Wyatt and Mike...
they killed Dirty Willy-
tortured him, froze him, hung him.
But what did they want out of him?
Money? Do-re-mi?
- You won't be surprised
if I tell you the answer is no.
- [Whimpers]
Dirty Willy had
one dirty little secret left...
and these guys were trying
to get it out of Mona... and us.
- It's been eight hours. Start talking.
- I got nothin' to say.
You just don't get it, do you, Dixon?
We do things the Vegas way.
Now, Mona's brother here
is gonna drive her into the desert.
If he doesn't hear from me in 30,
she's gone, and I ice the two of you.
- Oh, and I keep the dog.
- [Growling Continues]
Don't give 'em anything, Argyle.
Not one quarter!
- [Barking]
- Ah, put a sock in it, Dog.
That was a strange thing to say.
Yeah, right-
especially since dogs don't wear socks.
Not Dog. Mona. She said, "not a quarter."
"Don't give them one quarter."
Well, J-Man, Mona left a bucket
full of quarters in Dick Dixon's office.
Dirty Willy's secret. Whatever he was tryin'
to protect must have been in that bucket.
- Wyatt!
- Hey, what the hell are you doin'?
I'm gonna give him what he wants.
Wyatt!
- There it is.
- [Beeps]
[Wyatt On Tape]
Look, Willy. If you pay us what we need...
we won't need to get rough with you.
[Beeps]
Falzone wasn't extorting money
from Willy and his club. You were.
And the dirty fat boy
recorded me doin' it.
- All the time you just wanted that tape,
it was right there.
- Nice work, detectives.
Willy was just tryin' to get that tape
to Dick Dixon.
So now you got it.
Call your deputy and let Mona go.
Poor Willy didn't even know
that Dick Dixon had skipped town.
Wait a second.
You're not Dick Dixon?
- No.
- [Slot Machine Bell Ringing]
- [Ice Pick Tapping On Desk]
- Loser.
[Tapping Continues]
[Groaning]
Oh, hi, there.
- Let me outta this.
- Uh-uh.
- You know, you should be protecting people-
- [Slot Machine Clicking]
not extorting from them.
But I guess that's what they call
the "Vegas way," right?
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, we've already tried that.
- Let's try the Jarod way.
- No! No! No!
- You're totally whacked.
- You don't know the half of it.
- You're going to make a call.
You're going to let Mona go.
- I don't think so.
- Loser.
- [Sighs]
- [Wyatt Yelps]
- Oh. Ooh, that's harder than golf.
- You're outta your mind.
- Make the call.
- No.
- Uh, loser.
- Last chance.
- [Breathing Heavily]
- Loser.
- Okay.
- Fore!
- [Jarod Narrating] Wyatt finally made the call.
And so did I- to the F..B.I.
When they arrived at the office,
they found a killer waiting for them...
along with the evidence
to convict him-
all courtesy of the mysterious
Richard W. Dixon.
But the story isn't over.
I still have one more job to do.
Anything?
Nothing.
Which is what we're gonna be
when we get back to the Centre.
It was fun while it lasted-
[Whispering] Puff Daddy.
[Faucet Turns, Water Running]
Miss-
Hoo. I guess I'm not a scrub anymore.
I hope you like Renewal Wing,
'cause I'm gettin' you a gift certificate.
The Centre reeducators can wipe
this entire weekend from your brain.
[Jarod]
Well, you better tell them
that Broots caught me.
[Chuckles]
Don't have to.
We're a team, aren't we...
Dr. Funkenstein?
Well, that all depends
on one thing, baby.
Am I your Puff Daddy?
[Sighs]
Oh, yeah, baby.
And I wanna get funked up.
Oh, I have to watch?
You get to watch.
[Both Giggle]
I'll tell you what, Mr. Funkadelic.
If we're gonna do this,
let's do it right.
It's my turn to live out a fantasy.
- Bald men have always driven me crazy.
- [Broots Chuckles]
- # [Chorus Singing Slow Soul]
- And it takes more than one
to really satisfy me.

Miss Parker, what about us?
[Spoken Lyric]
No.
No.
No. No.
No!
What the- Ah! Mr. Wiggles.
[Sputters] Ow.
I told you not to fall asleep.
- I was asleep?
- Yeah.
- The whole time?
- Yes, Rip Van Winkle.
You were makin'
some weird noises too.
And by the way, what exactly
is a "Puff Daddy"?
[Jarod Narrating]
Like I said, I have one more thing to do.
But it isn't this... dream.
- It's somebody else's.
- [Strains]
- Can I help you with that?
- Why, I-
- [Chuckling]
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
If you knew, sir, how much I've wanted
to meet- This is an honor, sir.
- This is an honor.
- Listen. Third row, polka dot dress.
- Sir?
- Adella.
- She was wearin' a polka dot dress.
- You are a god.
[Chuckles] Listen. I understand
there's something you'd like me to hear.
- Well, as a matter of fact, uh,
you probably wouldn't wanna-
- # [Accordion: Stray Notes]
- You know-
- I'd love to.
- You would?
- I would.
- Yeah? [Chuckles]
- # [Stray Notes]
Okay. Here we go.

Well, that was unmistakablyyou.
- That's just the first verse.
There's more to come.
- I cannot wait.
Uh, listen.
I wanna see you all tonight at my show.
You'll be my guest.
I'll leave your names at the front door.
And by the way, I want you to know
that Adella was my inspiration too.
- Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
- See you. See you tonight.
[Benny]
What a guy.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
That could be the worst song
I've ever heard.
- I know. But to him it was a dream come true.
- [Chuckles]
Guess they mean a lot to you, huh?
- He listened. He liked it.
- [Argyle] Standing room only, Pop.
Speaking of a lot,
thank you for that donation.
It was for a good cause.
You know, I don't think I ever
got your name.
Well, everyone in town
calls me Dick Dixon.
- You're Dick Dixon?
- Yes.
- [Impact]
- [Body Hitting Ground]
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
I am sorry.
Uh, pardon me. Uh-
You're naked.
And you're not.
Uh-uh. No, I-
So, either you take yours offi...
or I'll put mine on.
These people are chasing-
I, uh- I gotta go.
Easy there, Mr. Maintenance Man.
I was just recharging my core.
It's like time travel
in The Terminator.
You've gotta be in the skin.
It's great for your karma.
Karma? What's karma?
Um, every good deed comes back to you.
Like a boomerang, only you don't throw it.
God, your lifeline-
it says you've been alone.
But there are these families
coming together.
Families?
- What?
- They're looking for you.
And while you search for them,
you bring other families together.
Keep doing what you're doing.
The good will come back.
Oh, thank you.
Now I really have to go.
Wait, your lifeline, it said something else.
You are gonna meet somebody just like you.
A kindred spirit.
A kindred spirit. Hmm.
Um, miss, you dropped your bag.
Damn!
"Jenna."
[Naked Woman's Voice]
You bring other families together.
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
[Miss Parker]
He defends the weak and abused.
Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
How was your breakfast, Mr. Pritchard?
Sam, you missed
some killer pancakes.
- My girl here is a budding chef.
- [Chuckles]
Well, don't thank me.
Thank Bisquick.
Chuck, you're in the back today.
If anybody needs me,
I'll be putting out fires.
Here we go.
Another day, another dollar.
[Car Alarm Blaring]
- Sounds like the Buick.
- Yeah, well, does numb nuts know?
[Coughing]
Secondhand smoke.
It's a killer.
- [Ringing]
- Yeah, babe?
You better get in here.
- Chuck! Chuck?
- [Chuck] Sam! I'm in the trunk!
- Get me outta the trunk!
- Son of a bitch!
Sam! Hurry up!
I'm in the trunk!
- Sam, meet Jarod Gray.
- You're late.
- What is this?
- It's a test. Jarod's with our security company.
The same one we're paying for four-star
protection. The kind we're not getting.
How'd you beat the cameras?
It was very difficult.
Sorry about all the bells and whistles...
but the company likes
to keep our men frosty.
Speaking of which, you might want to get
your head of security out of the trunk.
It's getting a little chilly out there.
Tell Chuck, now he's the night watchman,
and Jarod's the new head of security.
Get him an advance.
Roland, this isn't smart right now.
We got that thing in New Brunswick.
You wanna be the night watchman?
Welcome aboard.
Jarod, do you know Jenna?
You look... so familiar.
I have one of those faces.
[Miss Parker]
Is my little brother gonna be okay?
Well, his lungs were underdeveloped,
but the oxygen should help.
That's my boy.
God's greatest miracle.
[Speaking Gibberish]
The real miracle
would be for you and me...
in the shadow of new life
to start anew.
The Good Book says
"turn the other cheek."
I also remember something
about "eye for an eye."
Oh, Jarod sent a gift.
"Corinthians, 15:25.
Even a child is known by his doings."
Ring a bell there, Johnny Dogma?
God bless you all.
Willie, our work here is done.
[Sydney]
It's wrong?
It's not Corinthians.
It's Proverbs.
- Of course Raines had no clue.
- Well, how did you know?
Corinthians, 15:25.
"For he must reign till he hath
put all enemies under his feet."
The operative term being "reign."
- What do you think Jarod's trying to tell us?
- Raines is no convert.
He actually asked me to forgive him.
Maybe Raines has found God.
Maybe he should have thought of that
before he killed my mother.
- Find out what that son
of a bitch is up to.
- Okay.
[Sam]
Hey, look at the new guy hard at work.
I called the company about you.
I thought only customers
got a background check.
So, what did old Rudy have to say?
Ah, you're from Baltimore, an ex-cop.
That's right.
Six years Homicide.
I got tired of losin' my collars
to the courts.
That's where we gotta
change the books.
2,200 gun laws, more than we can enforce,
and I'm the bad guy? I'm a salesman.
Why would a cop leave a fat pension
to take a bullet for somebody?
Why does a salesman
need two bodyguards?
Well, we all got enemies, Jarod.
Well, maybe you should spread
some better karma around.
- Karma?
- Yeah. It's like a boomerang...
only you don't throw it.
- Long day, Mrs. Pritchard?
- Oh, I'm not Mrs. Pritchard yet.
- Roland's got me on lay away.
- We start makin' wedding plans after Saturday.
- The trip to New Brunswick.
- Yeah. Gotta see a friend.
I'm gonna want the Buick swept
and secured tomorrow morning.
Gotta protect my investment.
- You talkin' about me or the rock?
- Ain't I lucky?
All this and a sense of humor.
She means everything to me.
You take a bullet for her...
before you even think
about takin' one for me.
Well, I certainly hope
it doesn't come to that.
[Car Approaching]
She's my daughter, Dennis.
I have to see her.
She's at St. Charles.
- No, I'm leaving. I'm leaving.
- Not without me, I hope.
Jarod.
It's only going to get worse
after you're married.
He's gonna want you watched all the time.
Then when you have the little ones-
Oh, we won't be having children.
Roland's choice.
- He's a good man.
- I never said he wasn't.
You thought it, though.
Everyone does.
It's this business.
But Roland's made a good life for us.
It's like a... happy ending.
You do believe in happy endings,
don't you?
[Car Approaching]
Get down!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
[Policeman]
Make a list of all those employees that-
I'm supposed to know
when you leave the building.
Thank you.
- [Camera Shutter Clicking]
- Do you have any idea who did this?
I'd rather know how
they got so close.
- It was my fault. I just- I was-
- No, it was my fault.
I went to get the car.
I- I let my guard down.
You saved her life.
That's what matters.
She's gonna have my kids someday.
[Camera Shutter Clicking]
Let's go.
[Jenna's Voice]
She's my daughter, Dennis.
I have to see her.
She's at St. Charles.
Who the hell are you, pal?
[Priest]
The Body of Christ.
The Body of Christ.
The Body of Christ.
The Body of Christ.
The Body of Christ.
The Body of Christ.
The Body of Christ.
The Body of Christ.
- The Body of Christ.
- Amen.
- The Body of Christ.
- [Door Opens]
The Body of Christ.
The Body of Christ.
The Body of Christ.
Mr. McGann, your daughter
and I have a deal.
She'd better honor it if she knows
what's good for you and the kid.
- The Body of Christ. The Body of Christ.
- [Door Opens, Closes]
[Gunfire]
Uh- Sorry to interrupt.
I can come back another time.
No, uh, I got work to do.
Great.
- Keep an eye on the prize, will ya?
- Oh. Sure, no problem.
So, uh, thanks again...
for this morning.
We're really gettin'
our money's worth.
You're right. We have met.
At my house.
Agent Dennis Alonzo.
He followed me to your daughter's
first Communion rehearsal at St. Charles.
He seems to be strong-arming
your father. Why?
Is he trying to get you to testify
against your fiance or something?
Look, I can protect you.
And I can help you
get your family back.
But you're going to
have to trust me.
You're wrong, Mr. Gray.
I can't trust anyone.
You have no idea
what you're getting into.
"Operation Fat Cat. Objective:
Secure evidence on Roland Pritchard.
Owns 10 tristate gun shops,
money laundering, illegal files and-"
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm an ex-cop.
And I'm someone who can help you
get your daughter back.
Tell me she's okay. All right,
I'm gonna finish this assignment.
- Just tell me that she's okay.
- Assignment?
Wait a minute.
You're A.T.F.
Oh, my God.
How long have you been undercover?
Twelve months, 13 days.
Twelve months? You've been apart
from your daughter for over a year?
I miss my little girl.
# [Rap]
[Police Siren Wailing]
- This better be good.
- Okay.
The card Jarod sent with the gift-
the chapter and the verse numbers
were a code for Raines's computer.
Every day for the last six months,
Raines has been meeting with that guy.
Oh, my God.
Giuseppe.
- You know him?
- Junior year of high school. Rome.
Look at him.
You guys were like a thing
or something?
He was my date for the spring formal.
He tried to get to third base
in the front seat of his father's Ferrari.
I broke his finger.
Boy, he is still a biscuit.
You mean biscotti, don't you?
[Man]
Look up! Look up! Look up!
Shoot!
# [Rap]
Parker, is that you?
Giuseppe.
You're looking very well.
You too. Very well.
Give me a moment, will ya?
How's the finger?
Oh, it's-it's still bent.
Yeah, I feel bad about that.
Well, I have, uh,
changed a lot since then.
Yes, you have.
This all started when we traced
some guns back to one of Roland's shops.
They'd been used
in a school shooting.
The operation was supposed
to take three months, tops.
That snowballed into a year.
I started out as,
uh, Roland's assistant.
And then one day he asked me out.
A.T.F.. said, "Couldn't hurt."
A cup of coffee
turns into an evening.
[Sighs]
Alonzo forced me to go with it.
The next thing I know,
I'm wearing an engagement ring.
Have you ever been undercover, Jarod?
Once or twice.
She has your eyes.
- You've seen her?
- Yes. Her and your father.
They both look well, considering.
How long has it been
since you saw them?
Two months.
I used to go every week...
but, uh, Alonzo put a stop to that.
Said Roland was getting too close.
And what about you?
Were you getting too close?
[Shouting]
You think I'm enjoying this?
Look, I know Cassie needs me,
but I can't walk!
And what if Roland
finds out about her?
Her father's gone.
She can't lose another parent.
Jenna, just keep your voice down.
I understand.
They've moved Cass and my dad,
and Alonzo won't let me see them.
Whatever it takes to get the fat cat.
Don't you have enough
on Pritchard to put him away?
Roland's not the target.
We still don't know who
all this money washing's for. [Sighs]
- We meet him in two days.
- The old friend in New Brunswick.
Do me a favor.
Keep this.
It belonged to my mother.
I want Cassie to have that... if, uh...
things don't work out.
Everything will work out.
And then what?
I don't know who I am anymore, Jarod.
People change.
We used to call you "Shifty G."
It's no wonder
that you're Raines's priest.
This is about William?
Of course.
Jarod said you'd come.
You know Jarod?
Father Jarod
is the bishop's favorite envoy.
And Mr. Raines is studying
to be a deacon.
That's why he's meeting with you.
No. Daily confession.
William lives with many demons.
But he is also a child ofGod.
He will be granted absolution...
no matter what his sins.
Including murder?
He feels very badly
about Catherine's death...
and regrets profoundly
the pain it caused her daughter.
What other lies did he tell you?
I can't betray what
he told me in confession.
However, Jarod was curious
about something...
Mr. Raines told his associate
in the parking lot.
Something about
the... Veritas Project.
Veritas. Truth.
Overheard in the parking lot.
Is that yourway of betraying a confession?
I was wrong about you.
You're worse than Raines.
So full of anger.
That's my religion.
[Camera Shutter Clicking]
Uh, I'll be right up.
I'm gonna make a phone call.
[Cell Phone Ringing]
- This is Alonzo.
- So...
how do I look?
So you're an ex-cop, Detective Jarod Gray.
Six years Baltimore P.D.
That give you some right
to jeopardize my operation?
You're doin' a fine job. I overheard
Jenna yelling atyou on your cell phone.
- You're lucky it was me that
overheard and not Pritchard.
-Jen's a little frayed now.
Who wouldn't be? You've taken her family,
you're practically blackmailing her.
Why don't you admit it?
You're in over your head.
You think I wanted this? These attacks
on Pritchard are gettin' worse.
- I've noticed. Who's tryin' to kill him?
- You tell me.
Obviously you've read my file. You know that
I was a good cop and I'm here to help.
- Now, who is tryin' to kill him?
- The best we can figure it's a client.
Pritchard's skimming from the people
he's laundering money for.
- So he's more dangerous
than I thought he was.
- You have no idea.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Who the hell are you, anyway?
I'm somebody who's trying to make sure
that Agent McGann doesn't end up dead.
About a year ago, right after Jen started
workin' undercover here...
we found one of Pritchard's gun suppliers
dead in the woods, double tap at the chest.
Now, word was he crossed Pritchard,
but we never found a weapon to match ballistics.
So, you weren't able to pin
the murder on Pritchard.
- No.
- And now you're holding
Agent McGann's daughter?
We're not holding her.
We're protecting her.
By making her mother stay
with a killer?
Jen may be in deep,
but she's the best agent I know.
- Three more days, she'll get us what we need.
- Us... or you?
Excuse me, Mr. McGann?
Agent Jarod Gray, A.T.F.
I came down here to tell you
that your daughter will be home soon.
Just in time for Cassie's
first Communion, right?
I don't believe A.T.F. lies anymore.
That's not a lie, sir.
It's a promise.
Cassie. Mr. Gray here works
with your mother.
My mommy catches bad guys.
Yes, Cassie, she does.
She asked me to come down here...
to tell you that she misses you very much,
and she'll see you soon.
I see her at night, in my dreams.
But it's not the same.
Cassie, your mom asked me
to give you this.
She wants you to take
very good care of it.
Look at that, kiddo.
That was your grandma's ring.
Mommy hasn't come in a long time.
Does she not wanna see us?
Of course she does, Cassie.
I tell you what.
You save a seat for her
at your Communion.
That's a mighty big promise
you're making.
[Jarod]
She'll be here.
[Gunfire]
Jenna, Pritchard, get down!
[Gunshot]
[Footsteps Approaching]
Strike me down now, Lord.
Willie.
Miss Parker.
This saintly routine is wearin' kind of thin,
don't you think, Deacon?
You've been talking to my priest.
Please. Sit.
We've been down a dark road, you and I.
Our footprints side-by-side.
But at times...
there was only one set.
That was when I carried you.
Really?
I thought that was when
you were off killing my mother.
Believe what you must believe,
Miss Parker.
But find it in your heart to forgive me.
It will give you inner peace.
[Cell Phone Ringing]
What?
- Where are you?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
This Veritas thing Raines and Willie
were talking about.
It's an experimental
airborne toxin...
developed by the Centre
and shelved in the '80s.
- Raines is resurrecting it.
- Some people can't resist temptation.
- You know the one about
"thou shall not covet"?
- Of course.
That's one commandment
you don't want to break.
- Thanking you is gettin' to be a habit.
- Just doing my job.
- What's the word on the gunman?
- Muretta and I gotta talk to the cops.
You okay?
That look in your eyes,
it's genuine concern for him.
Emotional assimilation.
The psychological side effect
of prolonged undercover work.
You are an expert.
Just don't forget that the man
you're engaged to is a killer.
Roland's done a lot of terrible things,
but he's no killer.
- Alonzo didn't tell you, did he?
- Tell me what?
He's unbelievable.
Jarod?
Alonzo has left out a small detail.
Since he put that ring on your finger,
Pritchard killed a gun supplier.
- What?
- Stay focused or get out.
Okay, uh-
Let's just say that he is a killer.
That's all the more reason
for me to stay under.
I don't want anything
to happen to my little girl.
It's just...
one more night, unless,
of course, you know...
where the meeting is in New Brunswick.
Your fiance keeps that a secret.
Then again, I know
where he keeps those.
[Beeps]
[Beeps]
[Beeps]
[Beeping]
Looks like your cover's blown,
Agent McGann.
This is what Raines was up to.
Veritas was tested here
in the early '80s.
If this is a dead end, I'm gonna track down
Father Giuseppe and break his other nine digits.
It might be kind of fun, actually.
- More of that forbidden priest thing, huh?
- [Chuckles] Just open the door.
The door seems to be pressurized
or something.
I got it.
[Coughs]
There's some kind of gas!
Broots! Broots! Oh, my God!
Broots! Broots!
[Coughs]
Canary. Canary in a coal mine. Canary.
Canary in a coal mine?
[Coughing Continues]
Broots, I want you to find out anything else
you can about how this gas could possibly be used.
I'm gonna go find Father Giuseppe.
Have Sydney take a look at you.
- Why didn't you tell her?
- Certain details are kept from an agent.
Stop making excuses.
You crossed the line.
- The man is a killer!
- The agent could be compromised!
- The agent was compromised!
- What?
I found Jenna's personnel file
in Pritchard's gun safe.
Listen to me. We don't make a move
until Pritchard makes a move.
What if he makes a move on Jenna?
You prepared to dredge your agent up
from the Hudson?
- She knows the risks.
- What did you just say?
- It's the job!
- Is making her daughter an orphan
part of the job too?
We'll watch Pritchard. He won't take a dump
without us knowing. He won't do anything.
You'd better pray that he doesn't.
You're the bodyguard!
Protect her!
Those mandatory trigger locks,
they're a bitch, aren't they?
They're not mandatory yet.
I got no illusions
about what I do, Jarod.
Let me tell you somethin'.
When some pissed-off day trader...
decides to take an A.K.
to his brokerage firm...
I'm not standin' there
handin' him bullets either.
But what if he needs
some money laundered?
Come again?
I like to know who I'm protecting.
Sometimes knowledge is not power.
Well, in my case, it is.
Jenna isn't exactly
who she says she is.
She's A.T.F.
- Who have you told about this?
- Nobody.
Looks like now you're gonna need
some help calling off your engagement.
Let's just say I have
some experience in this arena.
No. I meant what I said.
You take a bullet for her.
- Jen is my future.
- Are you tellin' me
you're in love with her?
Let's just say I'm in love with what she
can give me- a get-out-of-jail-free card.
So, tonight, when we're safe, Jenna radios
her boss and I give them the fat cat...
and we get a little beach house
in a sexy, non-extradition country.
- If she follows the plan.
- She will.
A Colt 1911 "A."
It can be very convincing.
But I got somethin' better than that.
Jen's daughter.
Cute kid, huh?
Like I said, Jarod,
I got no illusions about what I do.
[Giuseppe]
You know how I stand on this.
[Miss Parker] Raines told me
what he's doing with the Veritas gas.
- He confessed!
- He said nothing about that.
He's a psychotic killer.
And he's up to something horrific.
- Do you define all men by their sins?
- Only the bad ones.
Only the ones that take a girl
in the Basilica de Roma and cop a feel.
That's not true and you know it.
This isn't about two teenagers
groping in a basilica.
- Besides, it was you who came on to me.
- [Scoffs]
- I rejected you. The pain of that
rejection lives inside you.
- Not true.
It is true, Parker.
You've rewritten history.
Create an enemy in your mind because
that's what you needed to survive.
Anger is your religion.
And you need enemies like me
and Mr. Raines to fuel that distorted faith.
If thy brother trespass against you,
rebuke him.
And if he repent, forgive him.
- He killed my mother.
- If he trespassed against thee...
- He has presided over every
moment of pain in my life.
- seven times in a day...
- He's a monster!
- thou shalt forgive him!
And you are not his priest.
You're his coconspirator!
Forgive yourself, Parker.
If you don't, you'll surely be dammed
to a life of eternal suffering.
God forgives.
I don't.
[Bell Tolling]
[Bell Tolling]
[Jarod]
You can't put your faith in him.
- He wouldn't hurt her.
- You can't take that chance.
- I don't have a choice!
I have to go with him tonight.
- Jen, listen to-
No. I have to finish this...
and know that son of a bitch
is behind bars.
It's the only way
that Cassie can be safe.
You can't talk me out of this.
- Where's Jarod?
- I sent him home.
Why?
Roll, baby.
I got a confession to make.
Jen! You have to trust me.
Don't do this.
All right, somebody tell me
what the hell is goin' on.
- I know you know who I am.
- Don't tell him anything!
Stop! I'll do what you ask.
I'll help you out of the country.
Just don't hurt my daughter.
- Don't go with him.
- Shut up! You back off.
No matter what he says,
you can't believe him!
He's still going to kill your daughter!
I would never kill a little girl.
[Gasping]
[Groaning]
Jarod, I'm sorry.
Get in the car.
You know what.
It's funny.
But I actually did fall in love with you,
in a strange way.
Then you had to tear my heart out.
But I guess you made the right choice.
Oh, she did.
You missed me!
You know, I heard this song once
that happiness was a warm gun.
Yes, it is.
You needa cooling-down period.
[Grunting]
Shooting an ex-cop.
Not a very smart idea.
Especially when he's put
blanks in your clip.
You see, there's this open case
over at the A. T.F..
Something about a gun supplier
found shot to death in the woods.
They never could make
a ballistics match.
Or find the killer.
Now they will.
[Jenna]
Want to know something funny?
I had feelings for you.
But you had to go...
and threaten my little girl.
Bad decision.
Karma. Ain't it a bitch?
- This is Alonzo. Over.
- [Jarod Over Radio] Alonzo.
-Jarod, you bastard,
what have you done with Jenna?
- She's safe and sound.
- Now, did you ever get the fat cat?
- We got him.
- But no Pritchard.
- Check the third alley off of 18th Street.
Oh, and, uh, I left a little present
for you under your seat.
[Broots] We tracked down some of the properties
of the gas that Raines was developing.
Veritas relaxes the lungs to the point
where they can no longer take in oxygen.
In small doses, it's not even lethal.
I'm sure Raines skipped that part.
Weak lungs is one of the theories
behind sudden infant death syndrome.
Oh, my God. The baby.
[Speaking Gibberish]
Stop!
Get away from him!
I know what you're up to
with the Veritas.
I don't think you do.
A diluted version of Veritas gas
helped me loosen baby Parker's lungs.
[Fussing]
He's free of this ball and chain.
I wish I could say
the same for myself.
I saw the testing room.
There are many villains
in the Centre, Miss Parker.
Iknow you need them to survive.
But I can't be your enemy anymore.
[Priest] This is the Lamb of God
who takes awaythe sins of the world.
Happy are we who are called
to the Lord's Supper.
- The Body of Christ.
- [Girl] Amen.
- The Body of Christ.
- [Girl #2] Amen.
- The Body of Christ.
- [Girl #3] Amen.
- The Body of Christ.
- Amen.
- The Body of Christ.
- [Girl #4] Amen.
May Almighty God bless you,
the Father...
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
The mass has ended. Let us go in peace
to always love and serve the Lord.
Look at your mother.
- You got the bad guy?
- We got him. Now let's go home.

You got a big weekend ahead ofyou.
Finish your homework?

Okay, that's enough of that. We have

Listen, gentlemen, I'd appreciate it...
if you all just turn right around

That's not very friendly comin' from a civil

- [Man Yells]

- No, no. It's okay.
- Of course, some of us
have a different opinion...
about the world bein'

- [Men] Yeah!

- Back inside now!

Yeah, I think they get

[Vehicles Departing]
[Men Whooping]
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
[Broots]
Angelo's gone postal.
He's going through the evidence from
Jarod's old Pretends, and he's flippin' out.
- The little freak's possessed.
- Has he said anything?
Plenty. But none of it
makes any sense.
Fire! Fire!
Like I said, he's possessed.
[Groaning]
Fire burn! Jarod!
Must help Jarod!
- [Groans]
- Angelo.
Jarod.
Jarod.
[Panting, Gasping]
- What's wrong?
- We must save Jarod.
From what?
From fire. From hate.
Hate kills.
Hate will kill Jarod.
Must save Jarod.
What do you make of it, Syd?
I believe Angelo thinks that
someone from Jarod's past...
is going to try and kill him.
[Angelo]
Jarod. We must save Jarod!
- The question is, who?
- [Angelo Yells]
[Angelo Yells]
[Men Whooping]
[Indistinct Shouting]
- I'd say we learned Pastor Jones
a lesson or two tonight!
- Whoo!
Well, a little visual aid always helped
my third-grade students get the point.
I'd say a burning cross is a lot
more effective than a filmstrip.
I guess we showed him
the light, huh, Jarod?
If a picture's
worth a thousand words...
a flamin'cross is worth a mouthful!
- Yeah!
- [Whooping]
It oughta be against the law
to have that much fun.
In fact, I believe
it is against the law.
- [All Laughing]
- It beats the hell outta
sellin' life insurance.
- I say we go celebrate!
- [All Cheering]
No, nobody's goin' anywhere.
Change of plans.
- Is there somethin' wrong?
- While you were all out playin',
I got a call from the general.
The general?
What'd he want?
He's comin' in early.
He could be here anytime.
So, why's that change our plan?
'Cause he's got a new mission.
A bold message.
One that's just not gonna
be heard around the country.
It's gonna be heard around the world.
- That sounds big.
- Yeah, it is, Donny.
And on account of that, he wants
each of you here when he shows up.
- We gotta stay here all night?
- Wait. We can't go anywhere?
Until he shows up.
Y'all been recruited
from outside the state.
The general's worried
you go into town...
and you'll stand out
like a raccoon in a henhouse.
Now, I got a little gift
here from the general...
he wants us to use
to deliver our message.
- C-4 explosive?
- Yeah.
Well, that packs a hell of a punch.
Damn right.
You're our demolition expert.
You're gonna rig us up a little device
to dis-unify this unity rally!
- [Laughing]
- I'll tell you somethin', boys.
When we're finished,
the partyin' ain't gonna stop.
- [All Cheering]
- Yeah!
Yeah! Whoo!
[Dispatcher]
A flag down at 4581 Prospect Street.
How long has this
craziness been goin' on?
Several weeks ago,
we organized a unity rally.
This event's supposed
to bring together...
people from the community
from all walks oflife.
Well, after support grew, that's
when we started receivin' threats.
- What kind of threats?
- Warnings.
- Tellin' us to call off the rally.
- And when you didn't?
That's when the acts
of vandalism began...
leadin' up to last night.
Look, Pastor, the rally's tomorrow.
These types probably
aren't going away. Maybe-
Maybe what, Sheriff? Huh?
Maybe we should just give in, huh?
Give in and just call the whole thing off.
No, Sheriff.
That's exactly what they want.
Postpone it.
Think about your girls.
You know, Sheriff, when I was 13...
I saw a man beaten
and dragged behind a truck...
and nobody did nothin' to stop it.
Not even me.
That man lived for three days...
the whole time prayin' to die.
That man, Sheriff, was my big brother.
See, if you don't fix
this kind of hate...
it will destroy
everyone that it touches.
It's because of my daughters
I gotta do this.
So yes, sir.
Yes, I will be at that rally
tomorrow with my church...
and my family.
Any progress?
Angelo senses that someone
Jarod brought to justice...
is going to try to kill him.
We're trying to find out who
by letting him empath...
various items the Centre
recovered from past Pretends.
I'm certainly not surprised someone
from Jarod's past wants to kill him.
In fact, that's a hell of a long line,
and it starts behind me.
Hey, look. That's the dress
the Black Widow was wearing.
The one that Jarod took down
for murdering her husband.
She certainly has enough reason.
And she did try to kill him once.
[Whispering]
Does he think it's her?
I want this to be over.
I know you do.
Jarod? I love you.
[Yells, Mutters]
Jarod's in danger!
But not her. Not a woman.
Syd, does he even know
what he's doing?
Jarod doesn't know.
Angelo is systematically evaluating and
eliminating individuals in Jarod's past...
with the most intense
feelings of hatred for him.
Then we need to keep this
from Lyle and Raines.
They'll only interfere
with Angelo's progress.
Then we'd better move fast, because,
uh, secrets aren't kept long around here.
If Angelo can successfully isolate
the potential killer, he can take us to him.
- And to Jarod?
- Hopefully in time to save him.
Even better, in time to catch him.
[Dog Barking]
#[Hip-hop Beat]
[Laughing]
Hey, turn that damn thing off,
will ya? Jungle music.
Can't even listen to the radio anymore
without hearin' that crap.
Ain't you about done with that thing?
About.
Just make sure it works.
- It'll work.
- It better.
We're gonna make this damn
unity rally a wake-up call.
General says that when the blood
of all them sons of Cain...
flows through the gutters,
our people will unite.
See God's will to exterminate
all the parasites...
who are sucking the life
out of this country.
- Amen, brother. Amen.
- Amen.
[Martin Luther King] Transformed into
an oasis of freedom and justice.
- I have a dream!
- [Applause]
That my four little children-
[Continues]
Why do people hate other people
because of the color of their skin?
I don't know, Jarod.
It's called racism.
It's important that you learn
what's wrong in the world...
as well as what's right.
I have a dream that one day-
Are they taught to do this?
In some ways, yes.
Jarod, there is no simple
solution to racism.
But there is. Stop hating.
It takes time and compassion.
Do you understand this, Jarod?
[Martin Luther King Continues]
- I understand it, but I can't accept it.
- I have a dream-
What's the matter with you, boy?
You look like you seen a ghost.
No, brother.
Just seein' the light.
There. It's finished.
When we pull this off, you're gonna
score big points with the general.
I'm gonna take this into town...
make sure it's all
in place for tomorrow.
- [Door Opens]
- [Man] I don't think so.
- [Door Closes]
- Nobody's goin' into town
till the general arrives.
I don't wanna make anybody suspicious.
I'll take care of this from now on.
You want somethin' to do,
finish reloadin' those shotgun shells.
Now, wait a minute. The plan was that
I would set any explosives that we used.
Well, the plan changed, hotshot.
General's orders.
He wants this set special.
He wants the preacher's
girls to be the message.
He wants us to kill them?
Yep. He's gonna put an end
to this unity crap once and for all.
[Sydney] I have tried every possible
avenue to contact Jarod.
- No response.
- Sydney, I think Angelo's on to something.
[Gun Clicking]
I hope he doesn't find the bullets.
The gun belonged to a mid-level
thug- a Joey Melino.
Killed an undercover cop.
Jarod sent him away.
Word from prison is,
Joey's not too happy about it.
Maybe he's paying someone
to kill Jarod.
- [Gun Clicks]
- [Screaming]
- [Screaming]
- Angelo, what is it?
There is danger! Death! Hate!
Hate getting closer toJarod!
- Oh!
- [Uncocks]
[Sighs]
Jarod doesn't want hate.
Doesn't want to kill.
But someone wants to kill Jarod!
Did you really think I wouldn't
find out who you are? Huh?
Jarod!
[Shuddering]
You're a dead man, Jarod!
You hear me? You're dead!
Ooh, you need to chill out.
Listen, Jarod, I'll
give you anything you want.
- See ya.
- Jarod, no!
- Let us out!
- He's dead! He's dead!
- You're dead! You're dead!
- [Gasps, Whimpering]
Angelo, is it Joey?
No, not- not Joey!
Someone hates Jarod more.
Hates others.
We must find soon.
- This is going nowhere.
- Jarod will die!
Patience, Parker.
Angelo is narrowing down
the suspects.
Must find soon, or Jarod will die.
We don't have time to be patient.
Finish them shells, Jarod.
We need another loser at the table.
[Laughing]
You been cheatin'. You gotta
give me a chance to win.
- Everybody's cheatin', Donny.
- Who's cheatin'?
- Delbert.
- Yeah!
- What you got? What you got?
- [Laughing]
- Let's move along, man.
- No, no, no, no.
Two pair. Two pair. Two 10s,
two sixes, and all mine, partner.
[Laughing]
[Chattering Continues]
[Donny] Look. Five. Two aces.
A pair of aces.
Just give me three more.
Attaboy.
[Laughs]
- [Indistinct Chattering]
- Look at that thi ng.
[Chattering Continues]
- [Rifle cocks]
- Goin'somewhere?
Yeah. To get a little black powder
to pack around the C-4.
I thought it might give
more impact visually.
General wants to use napalm.
- Napalm? But that wasn't part-
- Nah, no buts.
His plan, his cause-
We do things his way.
You got a problem with that?
Hell, no. I'm a believer.
I just like to know
what's goin' on. That's all.
And right now what's goin' on
is you're stayin' here.
- Yes-
- General's orders.
- Yes, sir.
- Luke.
- What?
- You got another message from the general.
- There a problem?
- As a matter of fact, there is.
He has word one of us isn't
exactly who we claim to be.
Sounds like one of us is a traitor.
General said to tell you
no one leaves till he gets here.
All right.
You boys get back in the house. We'll sort
this out when the general shows up.
Hey.
[Whistles]
God bless Kati and Daddy.
And God bless Momma up in heaven. Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
All right, you two.
Time for bed.
Daddy's angels got to rest
those voices for the rally tomorrow.
Why do those people hate us?
What did we do?
Here. Sit down.
Come here, baby.
[Sighs]
Listen.
You didn't do anything wrong.
You hear me, sweetheart?
You did nothing at all.
People hate... 'cause they're afraid.
They're afraid of things
that they don't know.
Things that they don't understand.
That's why this rally is so important.
- Understand?
- Mm-hmm.
- You sure?
- Yes.
Good. All right.
Let's get to bed.
Get some sleep, and we'll
see you in the morning. All right.
Mm. Night. Uh-oh.
Got it? Daddy got it.
Mm. Loveyou.
Daddy?
Can you please close the window?
Sure, sweetheart.
And lock it.
There. It's locked.
- Good night.
- [Both] Good night.
[Exhales]
AnywordonJarod?
- Looks like Saturday night
at your house, Broots.
- Huh?
Angelo's trying to empath
Captain Robert Saunders.
[Broots] He's the one serving 20 to life
at Leavenworth, thanks to Jarod.
Captain Robert Saunders.
Textbook sociopath.
As well as a convicted
rapist and murderer.
He certainly fits the profile.
And he's on record as having
sworn to get back at Jarod.
Jarod sure knows how to pick
his enemies, doesn't he?
- Yes, he has a penchant
for pissing people off.
- [Angelo Screams]
[Groans]
Saunders!
Hates Jarod!
Wants to hurt Jarod!
Wants to hurt Jarod!
[Jarod] What's the matter, Saunders?
You look scared.
- Who's in here?
- Just demons in your mind.
Stevens, is that you?
Hey, this is crazy!
Well, gotta go now. Have fun
in your own private little... hell.
Don't leave! Come on!
Let me out! [Echoing]
[Screaming]
[Grunts] Saunders hates Jarod,
but... not him.
Someone else hates Jarod more.
It's hard to imagine
it could get much worse.
[Panting]
Broots! Hurry!
There's no time left for Jarod!
Angelo, calm down!
I've never seen him like this.
Can't calm down!
[Screaming]
Hates Jarod! Hates Jarod!
[Yells]
Hates Miss Parker too!
[Dog Barking]
[Barking Continues]
All right. He's here.
Jarod, get them damn
beer bottles outta here.
[Dog Continues Barking]
General, we're glad you're here.
General.
Sir.
Everything's ready for tomorrow, sir.
We're just waitin' on your word.
Just like you ordered,
none of us have left.
We're all here to help you
figure out who the traitor is, sir.
Well, that won't be necessary...
will it, Jarod?
[Screams]
What the hell is this? You gonna
stand there or cut me out of this?
I spent a long time making that thing.
- You cut me outta this now,
or I'll blow you away.
- [Gun Clicking]
Guess your clip's empty. Gotta go.
Hurricane's comin'right through here.
You're dead! You're dead,
you son of a-
Matter of fact, we go back
a long way, don't we?
Last time we were together,
there was a hurricane blowin'.
Let me tell you somethin'.
That storm ain't got half the fury
that I got left in me right now.
- [Jarod Grunting]
- [Men Cheering]
- Traitor!
- [Men Shouting]
- Yeah, get him! Get him!
- [Men Cheering]
Gentlemen, we're back on schedule.
Bartlett's the guy that
tried to kill Jarod... and you.
And almost succeeded.
I had tracked Jarod to
the middle of the Everglades...
where we were trapped
together in a hurricane.
So that's the net
Jarod used to capture him.
Took more than a net to hold
an animal like Bartlett.
[Growling]
[Gunshot]
Honey, I'm home.
Bartlett, Angelo. Is he the one
who's going to kill Jarod?
Bartlett. Must stop Bartlett.
Bartlett hates Jarod.
Hates everyone.
Bartlett wants to kill.
Wants to kill Jarod.
- Sydney, help Jarod now.
- Parker, we have to do something.
Broots, call the Florida Bureau of Prisons.
- Find out if Bartlett is still in custody.
- Okay.
Bartlett is a racist sleazebag...
who would kill his own mother.
Syd, we have to find him.
If Bartlett finds Jarod first,
he will kill him.
And ruin my chance.
[Gasps, Sighs]
Let's just pray we're not too late.
Jarod, the Lord works
in mysterious ways.
See, you were his instrument
to have me thrown into jail...
where I could come to see
his purpose in my life.
And then through his divine
providence, I was set free...
so that I could unite my people
and cleanse this country.
And now here you are,
dropped right in my lap.
- Manna from heaven.
- You're sick, Bartlett.
You're so consumed with hate, you'll
destroy yourself and everyone around you.
- No, Jarod. I'm not sick.
- [Jarod Groans]
Misunderstood, yes. Persecuted like
the prophets of old, yes. But not sick.
- [Grunts, Groans]
- What do we do with him?
I'll take him out in the woods
and send him to his judgment.
[Whimpers]
[Grunting] You don't need
to dirty your hands with this.
Let me do it. It'd be my honor
to take this Judas to his justice.
[Jarod Panting]
A true apostle.
Do it down by the creek
and just leave his body there.
Dust to dust.
We have things to do for the
unity rally tomorrow, don't we?
There are gonna be a lot of people
singing the blues tomorrow.
- Get him outta here.
- Come on. Come on.
Let's go.
- Let's go!
- [Grunts]
[Jarod Panting]
[Gasping]
[Gasps]
Let's go.
Go on! Get down!
Get down on your knees!
[Panting]
You can't do this!
[Gunshot]
[Panting Continues]
I hope I didn't scare ya too bad.
Well, I gotta check my pants.
But I'm still alive.
I'm undercover too.
Georgia State Police.
A.T.F., federal task force.
We've been after Bartlett
ever since his conviction for murder...
and civil rights violations
were overturned.
Some Fed popped him for those.
My guess is that was you.
Guilty.
I had no idea he'd been released.
Do you have a plan?
No, Bartlett's changing everything.
I'm completely cut off from the outside.
Look, we go back in there right now,
we can pop him for conspiracy.
No. We catch him in the act of setting those
explosives, we can put him away for life.
If we don't stop him, he's gonna kill
Pastor Jones's little girls.
Here. Here.
[Panting]
You go back in there.
You keep him company.
I'll think of something.
And, uh, good luck.
Good luck.
He didn't beg... much.
[Men Laughing]
Well, that's too bad.
Takes some ofthe fun out ofit.
I should've known. Jarod
crossed the detonator wires.
This thing would've never gone off.
Well, look at that.
Ain't that pretty?
A little C-4 and napalm-
That oughta make
quite a little statement.
Yes, sir, it will.
I'll just run that into town.
You tell me where you
want me to place it.
No. This is my vision.
My calling.
- Then we'll do it together.
- I said it was my calling.
I do it alone.
You boys just be ready tomorrow.
Be ready for war.
[Door Closes]
[Young Sydney]
I'd like you to meet someone, Jarod.
You're a girl.
- Why did you save my life?
- Because...
I still remember the little girl
who gave me my first kiss.
I found out something on Bartlett.
He's been released from prison.
Let me guess. His conviction
was overturned on a technicality.
Exactly. But while he was in prison, he
started a violent white supremacist group.
- And?
- And rumor is he's in Georgia...
and he's organized a march
in opposition to a unity rally tomorrow.
- Then let's stop the son ofa bitch.
- Okay.
And get Jarod.
[Muttering Prayer]
[Piano Keys Slamming]
- Here to repent, brother!
- Jarod?
- Now who's singing the blues?
- I'm so sick to death ofyou!
You have more lives
than a barnyard cat.
But this is gonna be your last one.
You weren't able to take
the rounds out of my clip this time.
Well, I am sorry to disappoint you...
but guess who reloaded those shells?
I must have forgot
to put shot in them.
You son ofa bitch!
[Grunts]
Oh, by the way,
I owe you this one.
[Grunts]
- [Drops Bat]
- [Sighs]
[Jarod]
Oh, Bartlett?
Bartlett?
- Wake up!
- [Sighs]
Jarod, what the hell is this?
Think of it as your cross to bear.
And since you so enjoy
burning crosses...
and terrorizing innocent families...
I thought it might be fun for you
to experience terrorfor once.
Like you were going to do
to those two innocent little girls!
I wasn't gonna scare 'em.
I was gonna kill 'em! [Laughs]
Don't make me laugh.
Now, we've been through this
before, Jarod.
You're not gonna do anything.
[Laughing]
You ain't got the heart for it.
Now, that bitch you were with before-
She could do it.
Yeah.
Well, you see, it's not heart
that I need to burn you at the stake.
It's another part of my anatomy.
And let me tell ya, I got those.
[Grunts] You'll never get away
with this! I got people out there.
Luke and the boys.
Luke! Luke!
[Laughs]
You know, something, Bartlett?
You're not as smart
as you think you are.
You had two infiltrators
in your group.
Luke was an undercover cop
with the Georgia State Police.
The rest of your apostles
should be in custody just about now.
- Damn you! Damn you!
- No! Damn you!
You can't do this! Please don't do it!
Don't do it! Don't!
Help! I don't wanna die!
No! No! No!
Don't burn me alive! Please!
Jarod, I'm sorry! Please!
I don't wanna die!
Jarod, I'm begging you!
Please, not like this!
God! No! No!
I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna die!
Someone help me!
Help! Help, Jarod, please!
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
Dear God! Please! No!
[Sobbing]
You know something?
You're right.
I don't have the heart to kill.
- [Sirens Wailing]
- Or the hate.
- [Sirens Continue]
- Mmm.
Have fun... rotting in prison.

Pastor Jones, we are looking

We believe he's involved in a confrontation
with a racist named Bartlett.
I'm sorry.
Never seen him before.
Now, I do know about Bartlett. If you wanna
talk to him, try the State Penitentiary.
Good. I hope they
fry his ass this time.
Well, ma'am, it's my hope and prayer...
that one day Bartlett will
choose to end that life of hate.

Did you see the look
on that poor woman's face?
I know she's blind, but she acted
like she'd seen the devil himself.
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
[Broots] I pulled a still frame
off the front gate security camera.
- Well, he signed in under the name Ki Mak.
- Sounds Thai.
Cambodian. Run it through
our Interpol server, see what pops up.
- Okay.
- He has a tattoo.
- A tattoo?
- On the back of his right hand.
It's a snake eating itself.
I'll make a note.
- Think Lyle is up to something?
- I know Lyle is up to something.
The question is, what?
[Woman] Just make sure the invoices
are signed and initialed.
- Thanks.
- [Phone Ringing]
[Woman]
Agent Berger, I.N.S..
Uh, no, sir...
I can't deport someone because
you don't like the price of cigarettes.
Well, I suggest
you shop at another store.
No, sir, that's- that's not a joke.
That's America.
[Line Hangs Up, Dial Tone]
Can I help you, Mr., uh-
Agent. Ellis. Jarod Ellis.
I was sent down about a blind woman.
- Sent down?
- Yes, from D.C.
I was working a case outside of Stockbridge
when we got the call from your office.
From what agent?
Rinker.
- Mike Rinker?
- [Phone Ringing]
- Jack.
- [Ringing Continues]
Excuse me.
[Punching Keypad]
[Man On Radio]
Security to the southwest door.
Carol. Is Jack Rinker
still in his offiice?
He's gone.
Would you get me
his car phone? Thanks.
I give up.
One hour, and all I get is her name
and the same thing over and over again.
[Repeats Phrase Twice In Cambodian]
I'm fluent in five Asian languages, but I'll be
damned if I know what she's tryin'to say.
She's thirsty.
She would like a drink of water.
- You speak Cambodian?
- Doesn't everybody?
I've got Jack Rinker on a car phone.
Should I put him through?
Tell him to have a good vacation.
She's all yours.
Kim Chay.
[Speaking Cambodian] Jarod.
[Speaking Cambodian]
Could we try this in English?
Could you tell me what happened
today at the ceremony?
I mean you no harm.
Well, you're my second
surprise visit from D.C. today.
- Second?
- Agent Jarod Ellis?
Jarod?
6'2", 180 pounds, dark hair, dark eyes?
- You know him?
- We've met.
May I see your identification?
I'm Agent Greene. This is Agent Hill.
Internal Division.
[Jarod]
I realize this is all very confusing...
but I can't help you
unless I know what's going on.
It was reported...
that you kept saying the word "butcher"
over and over again at the ceremony.
Can you tell me why?
[Greene]
Where is he?
He's in the last interrogation room,
right down the hall.
Damn!
[Ki Mak] This problem must be
dealt with immediately.
I don't understand.
The woman you saw
at the ceremony this morning...
is an unfortunate link to my past...
which now makes her a link to yours.
I am sensitive to your concerns.
But if I'm not mistaken, she was also blind.
Under estimating the meek has
brought more than one army to its knees.
We have a very good army here.
- [Door Opens]
- [Clears Throat]
[Door Closes]
Did you find her?
[Whispers]
The blind woman has been taken.
Taken?
- By whom?
- By Jarod.
I suggest you tell your soldiers
this is war.
- [Bells Pealing]
- Here. Let me get that.
[Pealing Continues]
Is that a picture of your family?
Mother.
Father.
Brother.
Where are they now?
Dead.
All murdered by the Butcher.
All murdered by the Butcher.
[Broots] Mak came to the United States
three months ago from Venezuela.
I'm more interested
in his connection to Lyle.
Well, I don't know if it's related...
but Lyle's made three business trips
to Caracas in the past 12 months.
As far as I can tell, the Centre has no ties
to anyone or anything in that country.
- Not on paper, you mean.
- I did hear something else.
I was in the bathroom and I overheard
a couple Sweepers saying...
that Willie had a close encounter
with Jarod today.
- Where?
- The men's room, SL-10.
The encounter with Jarod, you boob.
Oh. Virginia. Across the river.
But that's not all. Willie has been assigned
special temporary duty to Lyle's team.
Where are you going?
To have a little talk with baby brother.
[Bells Pealing]
[Kim Chay]
All murdered by the Butcher.
- In a hurry?
- Extreme.
Hey, did you ever wonder
why a Cambodian citizen...
would choose to live in Venezuela?
Isn't that interesting? I suppose
it could be the climate. Or the coffee.
Or is it, perhaps...
Venezuela has no extradition treaty
with the West?
Something on your mind, Sis?
Who's Ki Mak?
And why is Raines's guard dog
babysitting him?
Shouldn't you be out hunting for Jarod?
It's funny you should ask that...
considering I heard your people
had a close encounter with him today.
Can I get a little privacy?
No.
Now, do you want to talk to me, or should I
go put my foot down on Willie's throat?
Mak is a former leader
of the Cambodian Freedom Fighters.
He fled Southeast Asia
after Saigon fell.
He went underground
for his own safety.
- What's he doing here?
- We met in Thailand about five years ago.
He helped me out of a situation.
I promised to return the favor.
Trust me, our little brush with Jarod
was purely coincidence.
Go on.
Mak needed a sponsor
to become a U.S. citizen.
I pulled some strings, got him a commission
as cultural liaison at the local port authority.
[Water Running]
Now, I suggest you refocus
your attention on Jarod...
and climb off my back
before I run out of patience.
Is that a threat?
What do you think?
You must really like sugar dates.
Actually... they're for a friend.
These prayer beads belong to-
Who are you?
I'm a friend of Kim Chay's.
I need to ask you some questions.
I built this for the other Cambodians
in the area.
A little piece of what we left behind.
Come.
We'll talk in the back room.
Please.
My country is very beautiful,
but it has seen much pain-
the war with America,
the genocidal march of Pol Pot.
The leader of the Khmer Rouge.
Yes.
Please, sit.
Nearly 25 years has passed...
but I can still smell
the burning bodies.
I keep these to remember,
to never forget what man is capable of.
Kim Chay was tortured
by the Khmer Rouge.
Worse, I'm afraid.
I had a brother
who lived in her village.
Kim Chay's family was at home
when the soldiers came.
Her father, her mother, her brother...
were executed in front ofher.
Yousee, she wasn't born blind.
It is told that she attacked
the offiicer in charge...
to try and save her family...
that she drew his blood...
with her bare hands.
She was six years old.
This man?
Yes. This man is Colonel Chen Thon.
He was an officer in the Khmer Rouge-
an evil killing monster.
Did you witness Thon
commit these murders?
No.
The only witness
still alive is Kim Chay.
Some of the worst officers fled
to the Golden Triangle...
and flourished in the heroin trade.
If Colonel Thon is here...
then Kim Chay's life is in great danger.
And now, I fear, so is yours.
It turns out Mak is being sworn in by
the Port Authority tomorrow afternoon.
- And you intend to be there?
- Lyle knows his ticket to the top
is still Jarod.
But all he seems to care about is making good
on a promise he made five years ago...
to a virtual stranger.
- Your point?
- There's more to this than we know.
And this Mak character is the key.
Hell, maybe Jarod'll
even make a surprise appearance.
- [Sighs]
- Well?
It's like Mak just appeared
out of thin air.
There's no birth certificate...
uh, school records, nothing.
- Records can disappear.
- They can also be erased.
I tried to open up a computer file
on Mak I had found earlier today...
to double-check some information.
It was gone. Wiped out.
It's like any history of this man is-
- Being destroyed before our eyes.
- Lyle.
He told me he met Mak in Thailand.
Broots, take that photo,
run it again for a visual match.
And this time isolate the primary search
to Southeast Asian targets-
books, magazines, newspapers.
And hurry. This guy could be gone
before we find out who he really is.
Kim Chay?
[Bells Pealing]
[Bell Tolls]
Kim Chay?
I know you don't want to
talk about what happened...
but I'm not going to just go away.
I never had a real home.
I understand pain...
and loss.
Tell me about your blindness.
It was the time of Year Zero.
Pol Pot and his followers
wanted to stop Thon...
begin the war with themself
as the only power.
The killings began with the teachers.
Then the spiritual leaders.
And finally the artists.
Your mother and your father.
They were writer of poetry.
Words of comfort and joy to the people.
Colonel Thon make my father
read from his own book.
Then he kill him...
and the other members of my family.
This was the day the sun went away.
I want to help the sun return for you.
But I have to examine your eyes.
Can I do that?
I feel your pain and loneliness.
You have lost many people that you love.
Yes.
[Bells Pealing]
[Phone Beeps]
- [Line Rings]
- This is Sydney.
I checked Kim Chay's eyes.
There's no sign
of damage or disease.
Have you ever encountered
something called terror silence?
First cases surfaced...
after the bombing
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Hospitals began seeing patients
quite unable to communicate.
And yet these people showed no signs
of physiological damage.
Their afflictions were psychosomatic reactions
to the horrific savagery they witnessed.
I believe that Kim Chay's blindness
is a form of terror silence.
Well, the human mind is capable of
almost anything in order to protect its host.
She doesn't deserve
a life of darkness, Sydney.
What approach should I take?
In some cases,
the stricken have responded...
by confronting the object of their terror.
But be very careful.
If she's pushed too hard,
she may never emerge from the darkness.
- [Knocking]
- Sydney!
Oh, by the way...
Miss Parker is planning a little trip
across the river this afternoon.
It seems she has become interested
in local politics.
A certain Port Authority commission hearing,
to be more precise.
I thought you'd be interested to know.
- Very interested.
- [Beeps]
Kim Chay.
I believe you have something
that's known as a conversion disorder.
I do not understand.
When something emotional,
something traumatic happens to a person...
it can manifest itself
in a physiological way.
In your case...
blindness.
Can this disorder be cured?
I believe it can.
- But-
- What?
You're going to have to face
the thing that triggered it.
You're going to have to face
Colonel Thon.
[Trembling, Sobbing]
He's going to remain a free man
unless you step forward.
Kim Chay, there is so much beauty
in the world.
Don't let this monster
take it away from you.
I have lived in the darkness
for so many years...
trying to erase
the face of the killer.
I cannot let the monster
back in again.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Okay, okay, okay.
We'll find another way.
We'll find another way.
Shh-shh-shh-shh.
[Sighs]
Okay. I ran the picture of Mak
and got a hit from a Bangkok newspaper.
It's a story that ran five years ago.
It turns out Mak's
real name is Chen Thon.
He was some military bigwig
with the Communists.
[Miss Parker]
So, Lyle lied about Mak. What a surprise.
- What's it say?
- I would've taken the time to have
the newspaper translated...
but I knew you spoke the language.
Well, I'm not getting it all...
but apparently Lyle was arrested
for assaulting a couple of prostitutes.
Lyle? What-
What is with this guy?
First it's the murder of Chay Lin.
Then it's the two sisters in college,
and then the bloody torture chamber...
a-and now this?
Parker, you okay?
Fine.
[Parker Retching, Coughing]
[Toilet Flushing]
- [Woman] I'm sorry, si r.
I don't know what happened.
- I don't need excuses. Just get it done.
I want any remaining trace
of Thon's previous life wiped out.
And make sure the suppliers
in Thailand are ready to move.
Excuse me, Mr. Lyle?
[Door Closes]
Mr. Mak called and asked
if you could meet him right away.
He said he has new information...
concerning the woman
from the ceremony.
He's waiting for you
downstairs in his car.
- Um, Lucy?
- Yes, sir?
That's a lovely dress you're wearing.
Thank you, sir.
[Door Opens, Closes]
Driver, where's-
What the hell is this?
Where's Mak?
I am sorry, sir...
but there's been
a slight change of plan.
You didn't think I'd let you sleep
through all the fun, now did you?
Take this thing off my head!
Oh, quit your whining!
You won't get away with this.
- They'll be looking for me.
- Meaning Colonel Thon?
Didn't think I was gonna allow you
to let that genocidal maniac...
free in the world again, did you?
- That's a done deal.
- Oh, yes.
That Port Commission thing.
Not a totally idiotic plan.
You have your guy appointed
to the Port Commission...
and then you have an open pipeline
to smuggle in heroin from Southeast Asia.
It's just business.
Just business.
With a man who butchered thousands
of innocent people in cold blood.
[Chuckling] You know my philosophy,
Jarod. Don't ask, don't tell.
Besides, you can't show your face
at that hearing.
Miss Parker will have
a small army waiting for you.
Miss Parker. Well, that could pose
quite a problem, couldn't it?
Ups-a-daisy.
[Grunts]
- What do you want from me?
- Time.
I'm going to dial Miss Parker. You're going
to tell her that you captured me.
You're gonna give her the address here.
She's gonna come down those stairs,
trip this wire and...
I think you can guess the rest.
[Exhales]
And ifl refuse?
That's not really an option.
When you used to torture me
at the Centre...
I had to apply a technique
that I learned as a little boy...
to help block out the physical pain.
I had to go to places in my mind.
You, on the other hand...
have not perfected
this particular survival technique.
Have you?
You-
[Groans]
[Exhales]
Intimidating, isn't it?
I took it off this rancher in Montana
who was abusing his cattle.
I know-you're thinking
it's not the same thing.
And you're right.
The cattle didn't deserve it.
Shall we make that phone call?
Hmm?
[Sydney]
Interesting reading?
Or can't you believe what it says?
I've known you since you were
a little girl, Parker.
I can tell when you're
trying to hide something.
It just doesn't seem like the kind of thing
you could say about a blood relation.
[Exhales]
The story isn't about an assault.
It's about a double murder.
Lyle was the prime suspect.
Hmm.
According to the paper, he used
an unidentified military source
to cut a deal with the police.
Colonel Thon.
And that isn't all, is it?
These girls weren't just killed.
They were mutilated.
- Mutilated?
- Some of their...
internal organs...
were removed.
[Clears Throat]
[Phone Rings]
- [Beeps]
- What?
Are you sure?
I hear you.
- I'm on my way!
- [Beeps]
That was Lyle.
He's capturedJarod.
I call this appointment session
of the Port Authority Commission to order.
Today's business includes
the confirmation of Mr. Ki Mak...
as cultural liaison to the P.A.C.
- Good morning, Mr. Mak.
- Ms. Owen. Gentlemen.
As I review the data before me,
I have to say I have never...
in my 23 years
as a member of this council...
come across such an exemplary list
of recommendations.
My life has been, uh,
dedicated and devoted...
to serving my fellow man.
I believe each of us is given
the opportunity to make a difference.
It is our obligation and duty
to do our very best.
Well, if there aren't any objections...
I suggest that we dispense
with formality and proceed to the vote.
That would be a very bad idea.
- Who are you?
- Oh, it's not important.
It's the man to whom you're
about to give the keys to the city...
you should correctly identify.
You know him as Ki Mak, scholar,
humanitarian, family man.
But his real name
is Colonel Chen Thon...
and his legacy consists
of the torture and genocide...
of thousands of people!
Mr. Mak, do you know this man...
or understand any of these
outrageous accusations?
Madam, my life is an open book,
one you have sitting before you.
As for this man, I can assume
that he's confused me with someone else.
What's confusing is that
you've been allowed to live this long.
Colonel Thon was the commander
of an elite killing squad...
responsible for the cold-blooded
murder of innocent men...
women and children.
This is nonsense! Look, I demand
that you remove this man-
I realize all this sounds incredible,
but if you would suspend these proceedings-
I did not come here to hear slander
and false accusations!
to investigate these charges,
you would overturn a life fraught
with torture and death!
Mr. Mak.
Can you speak to these charges?
America stands
as the last great hope for liberty...
a liberty many of my countrymen
have fought and died for.
Let me just say, if I am this-
this monster that I'm being accused of...
let there be one voice, one person...
step forward and prove that I'm guilty.
[Owen]
I agree.
Clearly, this is meaningless
without eyewitness testimony.
Is there anyone that can confirm
these horrific accusations?
[Kim Chay]
I can.
[Spectators Murmuring]
- And you are?
- My name is Kim Chay.
I was born in the Siam Valley
of Northern Cambodia.
The man standing before you...
is responsible for
the murderous deaths...
of my mother, father and brother.
- You witnessed these killings?
- I did.
And you can confirm the identity
of this man that stands before us...
as this Colonel Thon?
This is ridiculous.
This woman is obviously blind.
How can she accurately identify anyone?
For so many years,
I have lived in the dark...
afraid of the memory of your face.
- I will not be afraid anymore.
- [Shutter Clicks]
This is the man...
who killed my mother,
my father and my brother.
This is his blood-
blood drawn by a terrified
six-year-old girl, and that was me.
I suggest that we seal the building...
and have security to hold the accused
for proper authorities.
- [Shouting In Cambodian]
- [Gavel Rapping]
[Screaming]
[Gavel Continues Rapping]
Miss Parker! I know you're not
in a very good mood having to spend
the night trapped with Mr. Lyle.
Lord knows, anybody would be bummed out.
Not to mention being duped
by Jarod again.
I mean, it's like the guy-
the guy gets inside your head.
You can't make a decision without him
being two steps ahead of you.
Go away!
I found out what the tattoo
on Thon's hand means.
Congratulations.
It's the Cambodian symbol
for cannibalism.
If you're thinking of jumping...
I suggest you go up on the roof
and do it right.
You still haven't mastered
the curiously simple art of the knock.
You look terrible.
I had trouble sleeping last night.
I couldn't stop trying to figure out...
why Jarod didn't finish you
when he had the chance.
- I now know the reason.
- What's that?
He didn't want to kill the drama.
I mean, there are so many...
tasty little secrets left...
to be served up.
Not a very flattering picture, is it?
I know you killed those girls.
And after seeing
that artwork on your arm...
I can only imagine what happened
to the rest of them.
Well, you must not have
finished the article...
because I was acquitted
of all the charges.
And as for the tattoo,
well, it's just one of several.
Want to see the others?
You bought yourself out of jail...
and used a war criminal
to broker the deal.
Well, you have been...
a busy little beaver, haven't you?
Okay.
[Exhales]
For the sake of argument,
let's say that...
I did these horrible things
you're accusing me of.
- There's still no way to prove it.
- I have Mak.
Or Colonel Thon, as it turns out.
I put the right deal on the table...
he'll offer up you and
your psycho-pathetic sins
on a silver platter.
No pun intended.
And...
to whom are you going
to give this information?
The Triumvirate, for starters.
I'm sure they'd be very
interested to know...
they have a flesh-eating serial killer
running their organization.
I cut a deal with Thon,
and you're finished.
Oh, um, I'm sure the Colonel
would be interested in your offer...
if, of course, he could hear it.
[Chuckles]
So I guess you didn't read
the paper this morning, huh?
The authorities are calling it
a tragic accident.
I prefer to think of it as karma.
I'm just crazy about leftovers.
Aren't you?
My God.
You're insane.
[Judge] And that I take
this obligation freely...
And that I take
this obligation freely...
without any mental reservation...
without any mental reservation...
or purpose of evasion.
or purpose of evasion.
So help me, God.
So help me, God.
Congratulations.
You are now all United States citizens.
- I didn't think you would come.
- Are you kidding?
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
- How does it feel to be a citizen?
- Like I finally have a home.
You heard that Colonel Thon
died in a car accident?
I saw the paper.
But you are wrong.
He died when you gave me
the courage to face him.
What made you change your mind
about confronting him?
A friend reminded me
how much beauty there was in the world.
Thank you, Jarod.
I hope you find a way
to let the light back into your life.
Thank you.
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
[Broots]
It's Jarod's last lair. We know that much.
- How long since he left?
- It's about 24 hours.
We got a Clean-up crew
takin' the place apart as we speak.
Same old song and dance.
Yeah.
[Miss Parker]
Who's the egg headin the go-cart?
- That's Dr. Guchi Tuchen.
- The new head of the Centre's Clean-up unit.
- Credentials impeccable.
- Yeah, he's from Calcutta.
Remind me to cancel
the frozen steaks for Christmas.
Ah, Dr. Tuchen.
This is-
The infamous Miss Parker.
- Excuse me for not standing.
- Not a problem.
So, what did our little genius
leave us to clean up this time?
I'm afraid it's a bit
disturbing in nature.
How so?
Here.
- P.C.P.
- Ridiculous. Jarod wouldn't use drugs.
I'm afraid I will have to disagree.
We ran a series of field tests
on the blood residual of the syringes...
and it matched Jarod's perfectly.
[Sydney]
With what Jarod's been through...
addiction is a distinct possibility.
- Jarod's a junkie?
- We also found this.
It's Jarod's writing.
[Broots] What, do you think
he left it here by accident?
Maybe he really is caught up
in some kind of drug haze.
[Man Over Walkie-Talkie, Indistinct]
[Chattering]
We got one over here
already in the building.
I don't know what he's on,
but you're gonna have to lock him down.
- How's your personal injury insurance?
- Paid in full.
No one's gonna hurt ya.
We just wanna make sure you're okay.
- Let's do this easy, okay, pal? Come on.
- Easy.
Okay, let's go. Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.
[Grunting]
- Come on!
- No! No!
Mommy! No! No!
Mommy!
- Dad! No!
- Grab his feet!
Mommy! Daddy!
Don't let them take me!
[Yelling]
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
- [Siren Wails]
- [Police Radio, Indistinct]
- [Grunting]
- Come on!
- Who do we got?
- Trouble. You'd better keep both eyes
on this one.
Welcome to Vista House, Mr.Jones.
I'm Dr. Earl.
I am your staff psychologist.
I am here to help you
with your recovery.
Understand that no one
can stop you from using but you.
- [Muffled Laugh]
- Check his bag.
Now, Mr. Jones,
I need you to sign this.
[Panting]
What is it?
It is a consent form empowering us
to place you in lockdown.
Lockdown?
I don't like being locked up.
We need to take control during
the initial period of your withdrawal.
I know that may sound extreme,
but I believe our success rate speaks for itself.
Thank you.
What do you got, Garrett?
Got a change of clothes,
bath robe, wallet...
- $48 cash...
- Mm-hmm.
red notebook, blank.
- I keep a journal.
- [Dr. Earl] Excellent.
A big part of your recovery
will be writing down...
a searching and fearless
moral self-inventory.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.
[Grunting]
We have a code of ethics around here.
It's called the circle of trust.
You gain our trust, it comes back
to you in the way of privileges.
Betray that trust,
the circle is broken.
Consider this a warning.
[Straining, Grunting]
I-I don't feel so good.
Get him a bucket.
[Miss Parker]
"I'm searching for a special man.
"If you are handsome,
emotionally secure...
"and have learned some of
life's harder lessons...
we might have something in common."
How does it feel to be
the mayor of Loserville?
- I-I read that for entertainment.
- Right.
What did you find out
about Jarod's latest clue?
The "101776" clearly relates
to October 17, 1976.
The A-22 part has me stumped, though.
It's either August or April 22...
and it could relate to SL 22.
Maybe if you stopped reading
the want ads and- I'll be dammed.
- What? What is it?
- My lucky day, apparently.
"A-22."
Section "A," page 22.
Broots, go get the microfiche
from the Blue Cove paper...
dated October 17, 1976.
Maybe we can find out why
Jarod is hopped up on heroin.
Sydney, you all right?
Sydney, you all right?
- [Jarod] Okay, I'm cured.
Let me out of here.
- [Man] This is how it plays.
The doctors are like the generals.
They're sittin' up there on the hill.
They're watchin' the battle. But I'm the grunt.
I'm down there in the field.
I'm lookin' out for my buddies.
You gonna be my buddy there, Jarod?
- Sure. Why not?
- Good answer.
Okay, I bring you your meals,
I supervise your drug tests.
I clean your clothes.
I will even mop up your puke, man.
The only thing I ask in return
is that you don't give me any trouble.
This ain't easy what you're gonna be goin'
through here, but I can help make it...
a whole lot more productive, okay?
- Sorry, baby. Whoa.
- Rusty!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come on! I'm sick!
- I need somethin'!
- See that guy?
He is not my buddy.
Come on. We gotta make a pit stop.
All right, here.
Fill it up, unleaded.
- Can I get some privacy?
- You're holdin' the cup, aren't ya?
[Buzzer Sounds]
Well, not exactly The Four Seasons.
But let's face it.
You couldn't afford The Four Seasons.
[Buzzer Sounds]
[Shivering]
It's-It's so cold in here.
Yeah, well, you won't think so
once the hot flashes kick in.
All right, you got a bucket for whatever
comes up, and it'll come up. Trust me.
I don't think I can do this.
I just, uh, need a little somethin'...
you know, to carry me through,
you understand?
Just-Just somethin' for tonight, please?
- Get your hands off me, man!
- Come on. Don't leave me in here!
You can't leave me in here! Don't leave me-
Come on! Don't leave me-
[Panting, Grunting]
Well, bottoms up.
- [Chattering]
- [Jarod Vomiting]
Great.
[Vomiting Continues]
[Dr. Earl]
We have a new member of our group.
- This is Jarod.
- Welcome to Heroin Hilton, Jarod.
Thank you, Huey. Jarod, why don't you
tell the group what brought you here?
A large cop with bad breath.
Very clever. Perhaps you could be
a little more specific?
No, man, there's nothin' you can tell us
we haven't already heard or seen.
Let's just say that I'm going through
a slight identity crisis.
Okay.
Today, I want to talk
about responsibility...
about how we refuse to take
responsibility for our addiction.
Instead, we blame
everybody and everything else.
Well, I'll tell ya this, Doc.
You know, if I fall back into my habit...
I'm blaming Jill.
- Shut up, Huey.
- Chick's drivin'me nuts...
cryin' every five seconds...
yammerin' on about
her smack binge last week.
"I'm clean. I didn't use.
I don't know how it happened!"
It's the truth.
I don't know how it happened.
- That's whack, baby.
- I thought this was supposed
to be a support group?
She tested positive for opiates, dude.
Her denyin' she even used is a lie.
You're a liar.
- I'm not a liar.
- Liar, liar, liar.
- You don't know that.
- Okay, new meat.
Maybe the smack just kind of
floated down from the heavens...
and landed right in your bloodstream.
I lost custody of my son last week!
Why would I jeopardize the most
important thing in my life to use?
- Because you're a junkie.
- I'm not a junkie anymore, Huey.
I don't want him seein' me
in here like this.
Have an attitude of gratitude, Jill, hmm?
You're blessed.
Your son is going to get
to see you again, clean and alive.
What Huey is saying is that...
you need to accept the fact that
you have a problem.
I know I have a problem, Dr. Earl.
I lost my son.
Section "A,"page 22 had five obituaries.
So I ran the names through
the database, and one of them...
a guy named David Arnold,
used to work here.
- [Miss Parker] When?
- It doesn't say.
And there's no other information
on him, which is really strange...
because you know how this place is
about background checks.
Which makes your presence here
even more of a mystery.
This is ridiculous!
What if something happens to Jarod...
while we're chasing ghosts?
Broots, keep working the number codes,
and stay on this David Arnold lead.
Sure. No problem.
And, Broots?
You report onlyto me.
That's a fine-looking
little boy you have there.
I never actually knew my mother, but I always
imagined how great our relationship would be.
Look-Jarod, right?
I appreciate you defending me in here...
but, please, leave me alone, okay?
Sorry, I can't do that.
You see, the reason I'm in here...
is to help you,
as a favor to your father.
My father's been dead
for over 20 years.
Jill, I know.
Jill? Your little boy's here.
He's waitin' for you in the visitation lounge.
- I can't let him see me like this.
- You're his mother.
Nothing can change the way
he feels about you.
[Man On Speaker] Hilary and I
have a lot to do with you today, sport.
We've gotta pick up your tux for the wedding.
I've gotta get the plane tickets.
So you just say hi to Mommy,
and then let's get going, okay?
Todd, honey?
The tuxedo shop is open late...
and the travel agent
can messenger you the tickets.
Please, Daddy?
Chris, you spend as much time
with your mommy as you want, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Guess who.
- Mommy!
- Hey! Look at you!
- I've missed you so much!
- I missed you too.
Why are you shaking, Mommy?
- Mommy's been sick, baby.
- Are you gonna get better?
Yes. And guess what.
If Dr. Earl says it's okay,
I can come home in a couple of days.
[Chris]
Does that mean I get to live with you?
Well, honey, no.
Don't you love me anymore?
Yes, of course I do.
I love you with all my heart.
Oh, God.
Garrett!
Circle of trust,Jarod.
Whatever you're doing in here,
you just broke the circle.
Take him back to his room.
[Buzzer Sounds]
Come on.
Yeah.
[Beeps, Buzzer Sounds]
These are his orders.
[Beeps, Buzzer Sounds]
- What are you doing here?
- I just wanna talk to you.
This is the only place that we can talk
unmonitored. Please trust me.
Just leave me alone.
I don't think
he would have wanted that.
Where'd you get this?
Your father gave it to me. I was taken
from my family when I was a boy.
That photograph was your father's way
of giving me a family when I needed one.
I realize that all this sounds crazy,
but it's the truth.
You don't belong in here.
And I know...
you never would have done anything
to jeopardize the custody of your son.
You know, I remember
when this picture was taken.
I was a junior in high school.
That was the year
everything went crazy.
I met this great guy.
A dealer.
God, I got strung out so fast.
And your father got you clean.
No guilt trips.
Just unconditional love.
Then he died.
I stayed clean through the whole thing.
I was clean for a long time.
That's when I met Todd.
We got married, had Chris.
It was such a good life.
And then you started using again.
Yeah.
I don't have an excuse for it.
I screwed up.
By the time I realized
what I had done...
Todd had left, and he took Chris.
Then Todd met Hilary. I knew
if I was ever gonna get my boy back...
I could never use drugs again.
So I got clean again.
I got my teaching credential.
Everything was fine.
The court was gonna give me custody.
Then the day before the final hearing-
I swear to God
I don't remember using.
So I lost any chance
of getting my little boy back.
There is always a chance.
Not for me.
Once Hilary and Todd get married...
she can legally adopt him,
and then that's the end.
Tell me about this day that you said
you don't remember using.
I remember the morning. I was clean.
I came here for my weekly drug test.
I woke up three days later
strung out in the park.
I wouldn't have thrown it all away-
not my life, not my family.
[Beeps, Buzzer Sounds]
Hello, J ill.
How are we feeling today?
- Okay.
- Good.
Nurses tell me you've been having
a little trouble sleeping.
Would you like a clonidine patch?
Yes, please.
All right.
There.
That should help you relax.
Thank you.
Jill, I just wanna let you know,
if all goes well...
I think I can have you
out of here by Friday.
- Really?
- Really. We just wanna
make sure that you're ready...
- and there aren't gonna be any setbacks, okay?
- I'm ready. I promise.
Good. You get some sleep...
and I will check in on you later, okay?
Okay.
[Beeps, Buzzer Sounds]
[Broots]
The Delaware cartographer's offiice...
is e-mailing me a map coded 101776.
- A-22 should be the coordinates
that lead us to Jarod.
- Good work.
Will you let us know
the minute it comes in?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Broots, I wanna review
your G-4 report with you.
All right.
I'll catch up with you, Sydney.
Hmm.
- What do you got?
- Okay.
You know Winkey, the old guy with the facial
ticks that works down in the infirmary?
- We haven't had the pleasure.
- Okay. Anyway...
he remembers this David Arnold who used to
work there as an orderly like 20 years ago.
So I cross-referenced Arnold's name
with the infirmary's D.S.A. database...
and I came up with two matches.
The only problem is they're missing
from Winkey's archives.
Somebody's really gone
to some trouble...
erasing this guy from
the history books around here.
You've been making unauthorized entries
into the infirmary's database.
If it's David Arnold
you want to know about...
I can tell you he was one of the kindest,
gentlest men I ever had the pleasure of knowing.
- What's he doing these days?
- Pushing up daisies.
Arnold is deader
than your hair follicles.
[Sighs]
Tell me then, Miss Parker...
how does David Arnold get you
any closer to finding Jarod?
We explore all avenues in pursuit
of Jarod, even the dead ones.
He wouldn't be bugging us
about a database hit...
unless he had something to hide.
The answer lies in those missing D.S.A.s,
which are mostly likely...
in Raines's private collection.
- # [Dance]
- [Woman] Great. And one,
and two, and three, and four.
Keep it going.
Almost finished. Breathe.
Good, and arms.
And one, and two, and three, and four.
Good job.
Hey, nice ride, dude. What are we waitin' for?
Let's get the hell out of here.
Even if I could start it,
they don't let me ride it.
You know anything
about motorcycle maintenance?
Well, I read a book on it once.
Nothin' to do with motorcycles, however.
- Whoa, whoa. Whoa. God.
- Does it flood when you hit the throttle?
Yeah.
The tabs from your float bowl
are disconnected from the needle, see?
I'll be dammed.
Hey, thanks.
Cool shirt.
What's "Skint Rabbit"?
It's a rock-and-roll band.
We had a big hit in the '80s.
- "Bloody Love Bones"?
- I was kinda out of it in the '80s.
And the '70s.
Most of the '90s, for that matter.
Yeah, who wasn't?
But I was their head roadie.
We went everywhere. Toured with
the biggest. Stones, Allman Brothers.
Then we released two lame albums.
The next thing you know, we are warmin' up
high school gyms for Air Supply.
Were they having trouble
with their ventilation system?
Exactly.
Hey, listen, brother, um,
I really need to score.
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.
Come on. Your clammy skin,
your beady little pupils.
I think you know exactly what I mean.
Come on.
Help me out.
Garrett's your man.
[Jarod]
Garrett?
- Unless he got busted again.
- Again?
Earl nailed him a few weeks ago
dealin' smack to an outpatient.
How does an orderly in a drug
rehabilitation center get away with that?
Hey, man, there's stuff goin' on around
here none of us will ever know about.
Jill?
Jill? Jill?
Jill?
Somebody get in here!
She's O.D.'ing! Jill?
- I will take care of this.
I will take care of this.
- Check her respiration.
I need an airway and some 02 stat!
Get in here! Get in there!
Get in there!
Jill? Jill?
Jill, how could you do this to yourself?
[Broots]
Raines almost caught me.
I had to hide under his couch
for over an hour.
Then his masseuse came in
and rubbed him down with oil...
while they were singing
"Shall We Gather at the River."
The D.S.A.s?
You are not gonna believe this.
[Buzzer Sounds]
- Jill.
- Jarod, I swear I don't know
how this happened.
It doesn't matter. What matters now
is getting you through this.
Come on, come on.
Let's get you in the bed.
Come on. Come on.
I'm beginning to think maybe
I'm doing this.
I can't remember what's happening
to me anymore. Oh, God.
I can't go through this again.
I don't have the strength.
You're going to have
to find the strength for your son.
- I've lost him.
- No, you haven't.
[Sobbing]
[Vomiting]
Why are you doing this?
- I owe your father.
- For what?
[Young Jarod]
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!
[Grunting, Sobbing]
Somebody help me!
[Sobbing Continues]
- So he had a bad flu.
- This isn't the flu, Miss Parker. Watch.
[Tape Rewinding]
The self-righteous son of a bitch
got Jarod hooked on narcotics.
Here.
You have to drink and stay hydrated.
- One more. Come on.
- No.
Why would that place-
Why would the Centre give a child drugs?
Because to them, I was never a child.
You called for me, Doctor?
I need you to clean up the room.
The boy's sick.
Yes, sir.
Hey, kid.
I'm one of the orderlies.
Help me, please.
What's wrong with you?
Oh, my God.
Who did this to you?
Please help me.
Just hang in there, buddy.
I'm gonna help you through this, okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.
[Broots]
That's David Arnold.
There's the connection to Jarod.
Arnold helped him get through detox.
I'm so hot,
I feel like I'm burning up.
- Just hang tough. It'll pass.
- I hurt all over.
- Hang tough. It'll pass.
- [Vomits]
- I don't think I can do this.
- Yes, you can.
Just stay focused on me.
Come on. Come on.
Just a little bit to make
the pain go away.
- I can't do that, Jarod.
- I can't do this!
You've gotta get me something.
Please-Please get me something.
How about him?
Is he enough?
I need my-my family here to help me.
Where is your family?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
Here. You hang onto that.
Let my daughter Jill and I
be your family.
I don't know how I'm ever gonna
repay you for this.
Don't worry about it.
One day, you will.
Wait. Miss Parker,
you have to see the next D.S.A.
- Mr. Arnold?
- Yes, sir?
You're to be commended.
Thank you.
I don't mean to overstep
my position here...
but what possible reason could you have
to get this kid hooked on drugs?
That's not your concern.
Oh. I'm making it my concern, sir.
You'll be amply rewarded
for your efforts.
You know, you can keep your money.
I don't want anything
to do with this place.
We have a problem.
[Broots]
This is dated October 17..
the day before David Arnold...
accidentally drowned
in his own swimming pool.
Raines had him killed
to keep him quiet.
I can't help wondering,
where was Sydney during all this?
He was Jarod's protector.
How could he let this happen?
That's a good question.
I deserve to lose him.
Hilary will make a much better mother.
I just don't know how this happened.
Well, it's about time we found out.
Garrett, you got a patient loose.
[Beeps, Buzzer Sounds]
What the hell were you doin'
out of your room?
Were you afraid I was gonna
find your drug stash?
All right, you son of a bitch.
How could you do that?
How could you give drugs to a woman
who was tryin' to turn her life around?
- What the hell are you talkin' about?
- I'm talking about Jill Arnold!
I'm talking about doctoring
her clonidine patch with pure heroin.
I didn't!
-You wanna deal with me,
or should I call the police?
- Go to hell.
You're the drug supplier here.
Why'd you do it?
I swear! I swear! I don't even
have access to the clonidine patches.
- Only Dr. Earl could have laced them
with heroin.
- Heroin he got from you!
- [Toilet Flushes]
- All right, all right, all right.
When Earl caught me dealin' to Huey,
he threatened...
to have me arrested
unless I scored for him, all right?
I had no idea he was gonna use it
on a patient.
- Why is Dr. Earl keeping
Jill Arnold on drugs?
- I don't know!
I don't know! I don't.
I swear to God, I don't.
But I can get you into his office.
[No Audible Dialogue]
Hello, Hilary.
I'm calling for Dr. Earl.
It seems a situation has come up
regarding Jill Arnold.
He needs you to come down here
right away.
[Jarod]
Uh, Hilary, right? Dr. Earl said...
he was running just a little bit late.
Can I offer you
a glass of water while you wait?
[Young Jarod Groaning]
Somebody help me!
Sydney, how could you let this happen?
He was just a boy, Syd.
In those days, the Centre
was working with people...
who were trying to perfiect
a synthesized narcotic...
that might enhance mental perfiormance.
So you let them experiment on Jarod?
It was Raines's decision.
I guess the idea ofa great mind
like Jarod's becoming greater still...
was just too exciting
to walk away from.
The drug, of course, it turned out...
had pretty serious side effects.
Rapid addiction
and devastating withdrawal.
So Raines turns Jarod
into a junkie lab rat...
and you bury your head in the sand?
Sydney, why?
[ Panting, Grunting ]
They turned Sydney into an addict.
[Dr. Earl Groaning]
[Both Gasp]
- Oh, my God. Where am I?
- What's happening to me?
I would imagine that Jill Arnold must have
asked herself the very same question.
- Jarod?
- I think we should have
a little group therapy session.
Only this time,
the two of you get to be the patients.
- What are you talking about?
- Circle of trust, Doc.
You give Jill Arnold drugs
against her will.
I do the very same thing
to the two of you.
Only this time,
I use a hybrid narcotic...
that chemically tricks the brain into
thinking you've been addicted for years.
What you're experiencing now,
physically and mentally...
that's what's known as "cold turkey."
- Gobble, gobble.
- You're sick.
- You son of a bitch.
Now, that is not expressing
an attitude of gratitude, Doc.
But not to worry.
I brought along...
some clonidine patches
to help take that pain away.
- Please, give me a patch.
- First, we should talk about...
investigating our moral
self-inventory to decide...
- which one of you actually deserves a patch.
- Give it to me!
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm somebody that can help end your torment.
- Just tell me the truth.
- Come on. I can't take this.
- Don't give it to her, Jarod! Give it to me!
- Just-Just-Just talk to me.
- I can't.
- Mmm- Okay. Okay.
Please, give-give me a patch.
I guess you can look forward
to the next eight hours...
with your head in a bucket.
[Mimics Vomiting]
Give me a patch, please.
- [Hilary] Please give me a patch.
- One clonidine patch down.
- [Dr. Earl] Jarod, give it to me.
- Okay.
Okay. He did it.
- What?
- He needed the money.
- Shut up, you stupid bitch!
- Oh, please. Come on.
You said nobody would find out.
You're the one who needed
that stupid kid. You wanted the boy!
- Hey!
- Please, give me one ofthe patches.
Let me guess.
It went something like this.
Todd Moffiett is a very rich man.
So rich, in fact,
that if you two were to get divorced...
you could stand to make
one hell of a payday...
especially if you were
to adopt his son.
And what better way
to insure custody...
than to turn
his biological mother into a junkie.
- And who better to help you than
your ex-college sweetheart.
- How did you know that?
Let's just say that
I took a little peek...
into the doc's college yearbook.
You two make such a cute little couple.
It seems so sad...
that college sweethearts
such as yourself...
are gonna have to experience
such horrific pain.
I've had my experience with that little
devil you're on. And let me tell you-
Somebody help me!
it's a bitch.
Only one clonidine patch left.
It would be a shame to have to white-knuckle it
through such a terrible detox.
Okay! I did it.
I drugged Jill Arnold
so she would lose custody of her son.
- Now can I have that patch, please?
- No, he did it.
Please give me the patch.
Like you say, Doc...
recovery starts when an individual
admits that he or she has a problem.
Isn't that right, Todd?
- That's right.
- Oh, God.
Let me tell you, the two of you
have one hell of a problem.
Listen, sport, we're gonna see Mommy
in just a few minutes.
- Okay.
- So Jill was tellin'
the whole truth after all.
I feel like a real punk
layin' into her the way I did.
Hey, you live and you learn.
Yeah, but I've decided, you know, I'm gonna
finish up my time here the right way.
I've just been kind of
goin' through the motions.
I gotta start thinkin' about my future.
Good for you.
- Thanks a lot, Jarod. Somethin' for you.
- Hey, what's this?
- Skint Rabbit.
- Oh, wow.
"Bloody Love Bones." But don't listen to
it backwards. You'll end up here for real.
Thanks for everything.
I-I hope I can make this up to Jill.
Now's your chance.
Mommy!
Mommy, are we going home now?
We are gonna go home
in two seconds, okay?
- You look good.
- I'm startin' to feel good.
So what now?
One day at a time.
Jarod, I don't know how I could ever
repay you for everything you've done.
The debt's already been paid.
Thank you.
- [Phone Ringing]
- Sydney.
I didn't think
you'd still be working.
Good of you to call.
I was getting really worried.
'Cause you thought I might have slipped
back into my childhood drug addiction?
Just tell me why.
Why did you let them do that to me?
Jarod-
You're the only person that I trusted.
You were like a-
You should've stopped them, Sydney.
Jarod, I couldn't.
Why not?
Because I was a test subject myself.
What are you talking about?
I asked Raines-
Rather, I demanded...
that you be left out of the drug testing
and that they use me instead.
And Raines agreed.
It was only when I came out of detox
that I realized what had happened-
that he'd lied.
So you sacrificed yourself
to protect me.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
I never wanted you
to feel obligated...
to stay here at the Centre...
if you had a chance to get away.
I'm sorry, Jarod.
I'm really sorry.
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
[Phone Beeping]
- [Ringing]
- [Miss Parker] What?
- [Jarod] Always the workaholic.
- Jarod-
Tormenting hours are from 9:00 to 5:00.
Call back tomorrow.
Who said I was calling to torment you?
Maybe I was just feeling nostalgic.
If you're feeling homesick, come visit.
I have a room all ready for you.
Generous offer,
but I will regretfully decline.
So. What is it, Jarod?
I was hoping you'd give my best
to the rest of our dysfunctional family.
Particularly Mr. Raines.
Oh, I'll be sure to say hey,
next time I see him.
When was the last time you saw him?
He hasn't been around
much lately, has he?
I count Raines's absence as a blessing.
I don't question it.
If you don't question...
- you don't learn.
- [Beeps]
I brought the Triumvirate
phone logs you requested.
Back burner, Broots.
I have a holier crusade for you.
Find out where Raines
has been lately.
[Ringing]
[Ringing Continues]
- [Beeps]
- Hello?
Well, it's about damn time.
Tell me you found him.
Look, I'm paying you
all this money...
'cause you're supposed
to be on the inside.
This boy should be dead by now.
Bolton, Minnesota must
be a podunk, nothing town.
How hard can it be to find him?
Well, he goes to school, doesn't he?
The clock is ticking.
My new trial is in five days...
and this boy's testimony is the
only thing that they've got on me.
I want you to find him.
I want you to kill him.
Otherwise, you're dead.
Got me? Don't let me down.
What's the problem, buddy?
You in some kind of hurry?
Yeah.
As a matter offact, I am.
[Bell Ringing]
[Chattering]
- [Claps]
- Good morning, class.
My name is Mr. Brodie.
I'm your substitute teacher.
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
Mr. Conklin, your regular teacher...
is on vacation, so before we get started...
I'd like to get to know
all of you a little bit better.
- Do you know about sex?
- [Laughter]
Mr. Conklin said we're gonna
start our sex education this week.
- My mom signed a permission slip.
- Kevin-
Interested in biology. Good.
[Boy]
I already know about sex.
- My dad has the Internet.
- Joel- Likes computers.
Mr. Brodie?
Are you married?
Uh, no, uh, Gemma.
- I'm not.
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Yeah. Does she know about sex?
- [Laughter]
I'm the one that's supposed
to be asking the questions, remember?
What about you, uh, Matthew?
- What are you interested in?
- Uh-
I like to read, I guess.
You like to read.
That's a good thing.
And you, uh, Eric.
What are your interests?
Cool stuff. Espionage.
Counterintelligence.
You know, I could tell you more,
but, uh, I'd have to kill you.
[Laughter]
Eric's a freak!
He can't even write.
- It's all gibberish.
- It's not gibberish, Joel.
It's asecret code,
so knuckle-dragging mopes...
- like you can't read it.
- Oh, yeah?
It's probably a love letter
to your girlfriend Molly over there.
[Laughter]
All right. Can we, uh,
get back on track here?
- [Laughing, Chattering]
- Uh, class.
- Class.
- [Laughing, Chattering Continue]
Enough!
[Whistles]
Could you cut me
a little slack here?
It's not easy being
the new kid in school.
I'll bet some of you know about that.
Tell me something.
How many of you were born here?
How many of you spent
your whole life in Bolton?
Mr. Brodie? I was born here,
but my brother wasn't.
Okay. And how many of you
have brothers and sisters?
- Does this mean we're not
gonna learn about sex?
- [Laughter]
[Woman]
It was a child's eyewitness testimony...
that sealed Esposito's fate
to a life in prison.
However, just last month
the court granted Esposito a new trial...
based on a procedural technicality.
The charges against Esposito
stem from the brutal murder...
of a Brooklyn shop owner.
According to police, Esposito bludgeoned
and then buried the victim's body...
unaware the crime was being
witnessed by a fifth grader...
on a field trip from nearby
Woodbury Elementary School.
What's our rule
about other people's things?
- Excuse me.
- Those aren't your files, are they?
Uh, no, but there was
nobody in the office so I just-
Our rule about other people's things
is, "we don't touch them."
- I understand, but there was-
- Butts belong in ashtrays, mister.
It's all right, Mrs. Warner.
Jarod's our new sixth grade teacher.
I'll expect those back, young man.
Don't worry about
Mrs. Warner. She's a lifer.
- A lifer?
- Been here 32 years.
Teaching a 10-year-old
is the only language she knows.
Kind of scary, isn't it? Just like
being in grade school all over again.
Or for the very first time. Hi.
- Hi.
- Jarod, Rachel Daly, our student counselor.
Jarod's taking over the sixth graders
while Mr. Conklin's in Hawaii.
You believe Conklin's luck?
He's always been talking about Hawaii...
and out of nowhere he wins a trip.
Said he didn't even
remember entering the contest.
- Hmm. Unbelievable.
- Well, if you'll excuse me...
I've got a fourth grader
who is habitually pulling fire alarms.
- Nice to meet you, Jarod.
- Nice to meet you.
Principal Bauer, while I've got you here-
I have a student in my class-
Uh, Matthew Reese.
His records only go back 11 months,
and before that...
- it's like he doesn't exist.
- Matthew only moved here last year.
But even still, wouldn't
his old school transfer the records over?
Normally, but according to his mom,
his last school had a fire.
All the files were destroyed.
Well.
I guess that explains it.
[Miss Parker]
Raines has been going to an insane asylum?
Uh, the Pratt Institute.
It's about an hour south of here.
He's been going a couple of times a day.
Look. There he is.
- Cue men with big butterfly nets.
- No, no. He's not a patient.
He's visiting someone.
There's a woman.
A woman who means something to Jarod.
- The question is, who is she?
- [Sydney] My God.
Sydney?
- [Sydney] It's Edna Raines.
- Raines's wife?
- It's impossible.
- Kick the rock over, Syd.
What am I not seeing?
Edna Raines committed suicide
more than 20 years ago.
Or so you were told.
- Broots, get a town car.
- No, it's too late.
The guy at the hospital
told me she escaped last night.
[Children Laughing, Chattering]
Okay, a teacher's pay
is one thing, Jarod...
[Laughing]
but eating the school lunch-
- What, do you have a death wish?
- I was intrigued.
A tube of processed meat
covered by a deep-fried carbohydrate...
and skewered with a stick
so that it's fully portable.
- Sort of a meat Popsicle.
- Is that your first corn dog?
- Mmm. Good.
- [Laughs]
You're much braver than I am.
I've noticed that Matthew
doesn't socialize much...
with the other children.
Are there any issues
about him I should know about?
Matthew's been a little slow
assimilating since he transferred here...
but some kids are just like that.
- Why the interest?
- I just figure the more I know
about my kids...
the more I can help them.
[Esposito]
Three days and counting.
I don't want to hear
you're getting close.
I want to hear that this kid is dead.
If you can't figure out which boy
it is and get this job done...
then I'm gonna come do it myself.
You better worry that I just
don't bury you with him.
[Doorbell Rings]
- Hello.
- Hi.
My son said that there was
a new teacher in town...
so I wanted to bring you
a little something to say welcome.
- That's very nice. Thank you.
- Oh!
It's hot. I'd probably better do this.
I know what it's like
to be new in town.
Matthew and I just
moved here ourselves last year.
You said, uh, Matthew.
Matthew Reese?
Oh! I'm his mom.
I didn't say that, did I?
- No.
- No. [Laughs]
Where did you two move here from?
From back East.
[Doorbell Rings]
Excuse me.
- Hello.
- Uh, hello.
- Hello, Justine.
- Hello, Gail.
- You two know each other?
- Yeah.
We're in the same single moms'
cooking group here in town.
Oh, uh- Mmm.
[Doorbell Rings]
[Jarod]
It's pretty cool, huh?
You can see a whole world of things that
are too small to see with your human eye.
Hey, maybe we can use it
to see Eric's tiny little brain.
- [Laughter]
- Mr. Brodie, how do they
swim around like that?
That's a very good question.
Why don't you all read
chapter four and find out?
- [Students Groaning]
- I lost that book.
[Chuckles]
Get to work.
- It's pretty neat, huh?
- Yeah.
But I've seen protozoans
and stuff before.
We had microscopes in
the science room at my old school.
- Did you like your old school?
- I guess.
Must have been pretty tough-
leaving your old friends like that.
Mom said we didn't have a choice.
We had to move.
- I'm not really supposed to talk about it.
- [Bell Ringing]
Come on, Joel.
That's for my eyes only.
Oh.
I'm sorry, dude. Here.
[Laughs]
- This is sweet.
- It's way over your head.
Oh, yeah? Let's find out.
Hi. I'm Eric Gantry,
and I'm a scrawny little freak...
and I'm so madly in love with Molly.
[Joel On Recorder] Hi. I'm Eric Gantry,
and I'm a scrawny little freak...
and I'm so madly in love with Molly.
What's our rule about
other people's things, Joel?
- What?
- We do not touch them.
Pretty manly, freak-
Always having a teacher rescue you.
It seems he has it in for you.
It's no big deal.
What's a secret agent
without an archenemy, right?
Just forget about it.
- Hey!
- [CarStarts]
- [Tires Screeching]
- Hey!
[Sydney]
I still can't believe Edna's alive.
[Miss Parker]
You sound as if you liked her, Syd.
Very much so. You see, Edna was
not like so many company wives.
There was something
more alive about her.
There's also something
familiar about her.
She was working as a physician,
right here at the Centre...
- in the staff dispensary.
- Right.
In fact, I think she saw me
when I had the mumps.
- Your mother trusted her completely.
- She did?
Edna, you see, had
many admirable qualities.
She was as vocal
in community politics...
as she was at Centre cocktail parties.
How did she end up marrying Raines?
After the murder of their daughter,
Edna fell apart.
I was told she took
an overdose of barbiturates.
I was at the funeral, Parker.
I wonder what's really buried
out there in the Centre cemetery.
I've got Broots out hunting for Edna.
[Sydney]
Raines must be doing the same.
I think it's testing
his new-found innerpeace.
- [Knocking]
- Not a word to anyone, Sydney. Good night.
Broots, tell me something good.
Oh, it's so good to see you again,
Catherine.
- [Bell Ringing]
- Great little town like Bolton-
Never thought we'd have
sickos hanging around our school.
Did you get a good look at him?
- No, and he didn't stick around for questions.
- Reminds me.
Kids are having a big dance
on Friday- Sadie Hawkins-
in light of yesterday, I'd feel better
if we had another chaperone there.
Oh. I look forward to it.
And I can't wait to meet this Miss Hawkins.
Wait, honey. Forgot your lunch.
Remember, I'm working late, okay?
So leftovers for dinner.
- Bye.
- Excuse me, Mrs. Gantry.
My name is Jarod Brodie.
I'm Eric's new teacher.
I was wondering if I could talk to you
about some trouble he's having.
Oh, you mean Joel? Yeah, Eric
told me about what happened yesterday.
Joel is a bit of a problem.
But you think Eric's all right otherwise?
- "Otherwise"?
- Oh, you know, I just worry, that's all.
You know, with this whole
"secret agent"...
spy game of his.
Pretending isn't so bad.
Yeah, as long as
he's not hiding in it.
But it is the sixth grade.
I'm probably just being silly.
Hey, it's not silly
to care about your son.
I'll have a talk with him.
- [Bell Ringing]
- Thank you.
Excuse me, Mrs. Warner.
The parking sticker you gave me-
I can't find it anywhere.
I must have lost it.
Boys- They'd lose their heads
if they weren't attached.
Well, technically,
lack of cranial attachment...
would nullify all other
motor skills, therefore the notion-
Uh, if it helps, I believe
it was sticker number 48.
No, Mr. Brodie, you had 55.
Number 48 belongs
to Larry Grasso, our janitor.
Thank you.
Mr. Brodie! Hi.
Matthew forgot his lunch.
So, I have just been dying to know...
what you thought of my risotto.
Actually, I was- I was going to call you.
Really?
The other evening, when
I was asking you the questions...
about where you used to live-
I know why you were dodging them.
Did- Did I give you that impression?
Gail, I know why you and Matthew
had to move here.
You can trust me.
Really.
You have no idea how hard it's been...
keeping this a secret
and living this lie.
I mean, I-I thought
that he was a nice guy.
You know, I had no idea
about the hidden camera.
I guess everyone's
got the Internet these days.
- And- And before you knew it-
- You never lived in Woodbury?
There was no testimony, no trial?
Trial?
[Sydney]
How is Edna?
As vacant as the Bates Motel.
Edna? Do you remember me?
We were colleagues at the Centre...
- many, many years ago.
- Sydney.
That's right.
You do remember.
Edna? Edna, can you hear me?
Forget it, Syd. She's been clap-on,
clap-off all afternoon.
Twenty years of sedation must have
taken a damaging toll on her brain.
But something brought her here-
Something brought her here
looking for my mother.
- What?
- Let's try and find out.
Well, there's only one reason
the Centre would have gone to...
such lengths to keep her quiet.
She knows their
dirty little secrets.
I want to know them too.
Even if Edna were lucid...
she may not have
the capacity to tell you.
Well, this dig isn't over.
Takes one to know one, right?
Maybe we should
pass the shovel to Angelo...
and see what he can find in there.
[Eric]
Tough day, huh?
- I'm afraid so, Eric.
- Did you just get some bad news?
Yeah.
Wow.
That's some pretty sophisticated
spy equipment you got there.
What's that thing?
Hey, look at this-
An operative's communicator.
- You know, so my superiors can contact me.
- When you're on a mission.
Eric, Joel was kind
of a jerk yesterday...
the way he was making fun of you
in front of everybody like that.
I try not to let him get to me.
I don't really care what he or
any of the other non-operatives think.
Except for Molly, right?
I see the way you look at her.
That's supposed to be top secret.
Again, stupid Joel compromised everything.
Check this out.
I keep all my secrets in here.
You don't exactly have
the proper clearance...
but, uh, I'll make an exception.
Whoa.
- A surveillance photo. Nice going.
- She probably hates me.
Nah. No, you got that
dashing spy-thing going on.
Girls love that.
- Still, what do I do?
- Well, if I were you, I would just...
face it head on and tell her how you feel.
Noway. Suicide mission.
When you care about somebody,
you've gotta tell them...
while you've got the chance.
I wouldn't know what to say.
Here.
Practice into this thing,
and when you get it right...
tell her.
[Bell Ringing]
Mr. Brodie?
Thanks.
You're the first friend
I've made since I came here.
[Eric's Voice] You're the first friend
I made since I came here.
[Jarod's Voice] How many of you
spent your whole life in Bolton?
[Eric]
I keep all my secrets in here.
[Thinking]
Woodbury.
Eric is the witness.
Mrs. Warner, have you seen Eric Gantry?
He was talking to the janitor a few minutes
ago. Then I saw him walking home.
- Damn it.
- Mr. Brodie!
This is Agent X-4 checking in.
Eric! Eric!
[Tires Screeching]
Eric! Eric!
What happened?
Where's Eric?
I was trying to help the kid.
- You're a U.S. marshal.
- There's a leak inside Witness Protection.
I was just about to pull Eric in.
- They're gonna kill him
if you don't stop them.
- Who?
- Who shot you?
- Didn't see him.
Gotta be Esposito's inside man.
You hang on.
I'm going to get some help.
Save Eric. The killer knows where he lives.
Don't let him go home, Jarod.
Don't let him go home.
- Operative's communicator.
- So my superiors can contact me.
[Beeping]
[Beeping]
- [Muffled Cries]
- Shh, shh. It's me. Come on.
Back to my house.
Let's get your mom.
When I heard that animal
got out, I was, uh- I was so scared.
But then Witness Protection called
and they said not to worry...
that they were sending someone
out to keep an eye on us.
The janitor. Esposito's man
already got to him.
My God.
They gave me a number to call
in case of an emergency.
You can't. There's a leak
inside the agency.
It's not safe.
Okay. Okay, so what do we do?
We call the police?
My gut says that we stay
under everybody's radar-
at least for tonight.
Sit down and try to relax.
Mr. Brodie, I am so, so sorry...
that I lied in class when you asked
who's lived here a long time.
I mean, they told me
that sometimes I had to lie.
- It's not like I wanted to.
- Eric-
You did the right thing.
- Mom, I'm done.
- Okay, honey.
Hey. There's eight cartons
of ice cream in the freezer.
After your homework.
- He's a terrific kid.
- Yeah.
You two have been through a lot.
Yeah, but he's just a boy,
and he deserves a childhood...
surrounded by family and friends...
and instead he was hustled away
in the middle of the night...
taken away from everything.
It's not fair.
I know.
At least he has his mother
to take care of him.
My little man. I don't deserve him.
I really don't.
Saw the murder-
His class was going on a field trip...
and Eric woke up with some sniffles
and a fever coming on...
and I really should have
kept him home...
but I didn't.
- See, I had made plans that day.
- What happened wasn't your fault.
I am his mother.
I'm supposed to keep him
safe and happy, and he's neither.
And the worst part is...
that once the new trial starts,
it's gonna start all over again.
[Sydney]
Quietly, Angelo.
I'm taking you to see
a friend of mine- Edna.
- Sydney's friend dead.
- No, she's very much alive.
No. Dead inside.
That is why I need your help, Angelo.
Got it?
- Working late, Sydney?
- Isn't it past Bonzo's bedtime?
I have this idea...
that Angelo might
be able to empath...
- Jarod's next move.
- Your idea will have to wait.
Angelo's skills are required
in another pursuit at the moment.
That a problem?
No, of course not.
Come on, monkey boy.
[Eric]
Mom, what's gonna happen to us?
I don't know, kiddo. We may have
to play it fast and loose again.
Mom, I can't leave. Not yet.
Honey, I don't know
that we have a choice.
- Mom, please. There's something I have to do.
- Baby, I'm so sorry.
This never should have
happened to you.
Now try and get some sleep. Okay?
So what now?
The marshal said that Esposito's man
is someone inside the school.
I find him before he finds us.
[Beeping]
Mrs. Raines, that monster...
you're married to has kept you
doped up for the last 20 years.
Why? What did you know?
So good to see you again, Catherine.
That's right. I'm Catherine, your friend.
I'm here to help you,
but you need to help me too.
So good to see you again, Catherine.
And I know you came here
to see me for a reason.
Please... tell me what it is.
So good to see you again, Catherine.
Look. I'm not Catherine.
All right?
Catherine's been dead
a very long time.
Do you hear me?
[Groans]
I'm not my mother.
How are your mumps, little Miss Parker?
You remember.
Edna, please-
Tell me why you came here to see me.
- Mirage.
- "Mirage." What is mirage?
What your mother started.
Work she hoped you'd finish.
What kind of work?
Edna? Edna?
Edna, stay with me.
Rachel.
"Rachel Daly.
Chicago field office.
"Federal marshal,
Witness Protection Division.
- Current assignment: On leave."
- [Beeping]
Rachel Daly.
Rachel Daly, the school counselor?
She's a Witness Protection
agent from out of state.
- But why would she do that?
- Money. Eric's testimony...
is the only thing that could
put Esposito back in prison.
- Where is he?
- Uh, he's still sleeping.
I didn't want to wake him till I had to.
We have to get you two out of town.
I'll deal with Rachel later.
Oh, my God, they got him. Eric!
- Eric!
- No. This wasn't forced open.
It was unlocked from the inside.
But why? Where would he go?
- [School Bell Ringing]
- [Chattering]
# [Pop On P.A.]
Hey. Hi. Uh, Molly...
can I talk to you for a sec?
There's somewhere I have to go.
You know, it's a secret mission...
but I didn't want to leave
before I told you something.
Yeah? What?
All year long, I-
No. No, I'm sorry.
That's not what I meant.
Here.
Uh, can you just listen to this?
- Please?
- Sure.
Sorry to interrupt
your love connection...
but you already got a date-with my fist.
Eric.
Just the young man I was looking for.
Why don't you come with me?
There's someone here to see you.
Hey there, buddy.
Remember me?
Eric! Eric!
[Jarod]
Molly.
- Have you seen Eric Gantry?
- That jerk Joel chased him that way.
Eric! Eric!
Oh, my God. She has him.
Jarod, what are we gonna do?
- Where could they have taken him?
- Wait a minute.
- Smart boy, Eric.
- [Tape Rewinding]
- [Eric On Tape] Leave me alone.
- [Esposito] Shut up.
My God.
- Where are you taking me?
- Don't worry, kid. It's a short walk.
- Sorry I didn't bring a hard hat.
- [Daly] Come on, Eric.
- Let me go!
- Call the police.
[Eric]
Come on!
I swear to God,
I will not testify against you.
- Please let me go!
- Sorry, kid, but as long as you're alive...
you stand to seriously
foul up my life.
- Get in the hole.
- No!
Be a good boy, Eric, and do as he says.
Both of you.
Why don't you fill it yourself?
Thank God, Jarod.
- I saw him dragging Eric here and I didn't-
- I know, I know.
You know something?
I don't think this hole is full enough.
Oh!
- You okay?
- Uh, yeah.
- Good. You go take care of your mom now. Go.
- Okay.
It's kind of fitting, don't you think?
You've gotten yourselves into a hole...
you can't get out of.
- Jarod, come on.
- Come on. We were just talking to that kid.
Oh, yes, like the way
she was just talking...
to that federal marshal-
when she murdered him...
or the way you were just
talking to the shop owner...
two years ago when he was
bludgeoned to death.
Oh. Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?
Jarod?
- Jarod, what are you doing?
- He's crazy.
Eric was just a boy.
All he wanted was his childhood-
to be with his family,
to play with his friends.
But you took all that away from him.
In an instant, everything
he knew was just taken away.
Well, now it's your turn to disappear...
and no one will ever miss you.
Okay, I did sell Eric out...
and I did shoot the marshal,
but I can help you out.
- I can testify against Esposito.
- Shut up!
I don't know. Why don't you offer her
some more money, Esposito?
- You're insane. You can't do this.
- Who the hell are you?
I'm just a guy who's digging your grave.
Oh, that's right-You two already dug it.
I'm just filling it in.
You better talk quick.
This stuff dries fast.
All right! All right, I did it!
I said I did it.
- Come again?
- I killed the shop owner.
I hired her to kill the kid.
Is that what you want to hear?
- Yes. As a matter of fact, it is.
- [Tape Rewinding]
[Esposito On Tape] I killed the shop
owner and I hired her to kill the kid.
Is that what you want to hear?
You're still going to disappear-
Both of you.
- [Daly] What are you doing?
- [Esposito] I gave you what you wanted.
[Daly, Esposito Shouting]
- Jarod! You can't just leave us in here.
- Wait! Wait!
Jarod!
What about Mirage?
Anything yet?
Uh-
[Clears Throat]
Well, I've, uh- I've scanned
the D.S.A. file directory, and-
The headlines, Broots.
Not the fine print.
No. Nothing on Mirage.
Maybe it's just nonsense. I mean,
this lady is a little whacked-out.
Most of the time, yeah,
but not when she said Mirage.
I know it.
- So-
- It's back to the salt mines for me.
[Bell Ringing]
Come on, Joel.
What did you bring for me today, freak?
What's this? Brownies?
Oh.
Don't, Joel. You'll be sorry.
Oh, I haven't been sorry yet.
[Snickers]
Mmm!
Mmm! That's good.
Too bad your mother
didn't make you any, freak.
Patience.
It won't be long, with the amount...
of prune extract we put in 'em.
I would say right... about...
now.
[Rumbling]
I wonder what came over him.
Something he ate, maybe?
Hmm.
[Laughing, Chattering]
No!
Well, Agent Gantry,
mission accomplished.
Mission accomplished.
[Bell Ringing]
Excuse me.
Seen the paper this morning?
Now, I can't understand...
how they got the story, and yet
there's not one mention about the guy...
- who made it all happen.
- Teaching can be such a thankless profession.
Not entirely.
- Thank you,Jarod.
- Thanks, Mr. Brodie.
Eric, can I talk to you for a sec?
I listened to your tape.
It was sweet.
I'm really glad you gave it to me.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
So I was wondering-
Do you want to go to the Sadie Hawkins
dance with me tomorrow night?
Yeah! I-I mean-
- Of course I do.
- Good.
I'll... see you in class.
Mom, we don't have
to leave tonight, do we?
Does a certain secret agent
have one last rendezvous?
Yeah.
[Miss Parker]
She okay, Sam?
She went and laid down.
I haven't heard a word from her.
Mrs. Raines? Edna?
[Whispering]
Oh, man.
Now we're left empty-handed.
Not exactly.
I still have Mirage.

[Broots] Raines's estranged wife
escaped that mental hospital...
just to tell you about
your mother and Mirage? Why?
[Miss Parker] Edna Raines said
Mirage was my mother's work.
Work I'm supposed to finish.
Well, no one seems to remember
any Centre project by that name.
- Could it be one of her delusions?
- You didn't see her eyes.
Syd, in that moment,
she was as sane as you and I.
[Scoffs]
Broots, you been
downloading porn again?
My e-mail server is whacked.
[Sighs] Someone around here has
heard of Mirage. You can bet on it.
Excuse me, ma'am. I'm here
to collect burn bags for incineration.
I... knew her.
- Excuse me?
- Catherine.
- She was a special person.
- You knew my mother?
And she always seemed like
a bright and shining spirit...
even in the darkest hours.
Sorry for the interruption.
Maybe we could... talk again.
If you- If you
wouldn't mind, Mr., um-
Name's Leonard.
And it would be my pleasure.
What the hell are you doing?
- Everything burns.
- Miss Parker'll want to see this.
I said everything burns.
Miss Parker must see this.
Big mistake, you dumb-
- [Grunts]
- [Gun Cocking]
I have to talk to Miss Parker.
[Woman] Details are sketchy,
but after the robbery, the five suspects...
posing as janitorial staff,
fled MAGNA Technologies in a brown van.
A hazmat team has been dispatched, and
the warehouse district has been quarantined.
We'll keep you updated
as the story unfolds.
Reporting live from the warehouse district,
now back to you in the studio.
[Man Screaming]
Let me outta here! Let me out!
[People Coughing]
My throat is on fire.
I can't breathe.
Something is very wrong here.
Oh, it's this.
It's what we stole.
- [Hissing]
- [Coughing Continues]
Oh, my God.
Hey, science guy.
You're making me nervous. What is it?
- [Sirens Wail]
- Soman nerve gas.
- That stuff could kill us, couldn't it?
- It already is.
- What do you mean, is?
- Is. Is!
Barring some miracle, we're all going
to be dead in less than six hours.
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
- [Broots] Miss Parker.
- Good night, Broots.
That guy went postal down in SL 26.
Started shooting up the place.
- That guy?
- Leonard, the clerk!
The burn bag guy
that knew your mother!
[Broots]
God.
We tried to negotiate with him.
- He wasn't interested.
- So you traded the olive branch for an Uzi.
Is that your Christian way, Raines?
He was armed and out of control.
He tried to kill one of my men.
There must have been another way.
I will not tolerate unstable
behavior from Centre employees.
I thought that was a job requirement.
Broots.
I want the surveillance footage
of what just happened here. Quick.
[Man] Ain't bad enough there's cops
searchin' for us everywhere.
Now you're tellin'us
we got six hours to live?
Who the hell are you to be
pronouncing us dead on arrival?
I don't have to, Mr. Job.
You can already feel it, can't you?
You all can.
It's on your skin.
It's in your lungs.
And it only gets worse.
- [Coughing]
- Elijah never said anything
about stealing nerve gas.
Poindexter here's probably
talking out his ass.
I mean, us, we know each other, right?
But him? Who the hell is he?
For all we know, he's some out of work
pharmacist. I think we should call Elijah.
Eve's right. We were supposed
to steal computer chips.
Yeah, not to mention
100,000 each for our efforts.
Thank you very much.
I say we call him.
Elijah said the target was a box.
That's all he said.
What difference does it make?
He owes us anyway, right?
- Screw it. I'm gonna call Elijah.
- No. Elijah calls us!
Always has, he always will!
[Eve] I don't know about you, but I'm not
just gonna sit here and wait to die.
There must be something
we can do about this Soman gas.
It affects the chemical
structure of the brain.
It's only a matter of time before
our paranoia turns into psychosis.
- Wait. What do you mean? We all go crazy?
- Exactly.
It breaks down our tissues. First we'll
feel nauseous, then the tremors...
and then, our internal organs will liquefy.
Our insides will look something
like, well, something like that.
Then your nose will start to bleed,
and it just won't-
No, stop. Okay? I just-
Make him stop.
All right, I can't-
[Gags, Coughs]
Look. Look.
It's-It's Elijah's laptop.
- He's gonna help us.
- [Eve] And what?
We wait for his call and-and
then surf the Web, Mr. Job?
I hear bleedout.com has
some real interesting graphics.
You're really turning into
one sarcastic bitch, you know that?
Ooh, you really do
have issues with women.
What was it?
Trauma with training pants?
Or did Mommy have Stoli
with her cornflakes every morning?
- Shut up!
- Or what?
- You want to smack me around a little, hmm?
- Okay. That's enough.
As sick as we're going to get,
we need to stick together.
- [Hard Typing]
- This is Elijah's laptop.
The question is why hasn't
he tried to contact us?
He used us as guinea pigs is why.
Look. Are we really gonna-
Are we gonna die?
No, brother. We're not gonna die.
I promise you that, okay?
I'm gonna take care of you. Don't I always
take care of you? I don't know about you.
Me and my brother, we're gettin'
the hell out of here. Come on. Let's go.
- And exactly where do you think you're going?
- To a hospital.
Use your brains, Mr. Cain.
What's left of them.
The way the black-and-white's
are circling around outside...
you and your brother won't get
a block before they pick you up.
Abraham's right. Our best chance is if we
stick together and wait for Elijah to contact us.
All right.
But if things get out of hand...
the last rational thought I'm gonna have is
putting a.38 slug in the back of your head.
If this gets out of hand,
I will consider that a favor.
[Coughing]
[Job]
Hey, I'm gettin' somethin'.
[Woman] The robbery occurred
in Dallas's industrial district.
Now, for unknown reasons,
the area's been cordoned off.
And an emergency
evacuation order has gone out...
to clear the area
of all non emergency personnel.
Evacuation. Cops already
know what we stole.
- If they know, then Elijah knows.
- Yeah, well, Elijah's gonna want his stuff, right?
So he's gonna come down and-and
get us out ofhere, right?
Right. Maybe he'll send a flock
off lying monkeys, moron.
- Hey, leave him alone. Now.
- [Job] Ease up, Tarzan.
You know, I knew
I should have cut and run...
when I realized you thought Groundhog Day
was a national holiday.
I'm not saying it's a major holiday.
I'm just saying it's right up there
with, uh, Secretary's Day.
Secretary's Day isn't
a national holiday either, Job.
And like you've ever
had a secretary anyway.
I had a secretary once.
And then lunch was over, we put our clothes
back on. She went back to her typing.
[Laughs]
Eh, speakin' of secretaries, hotshot,
what are you, some kind of a entry expert?
The name Mr. Elijah
gave me is Mr. Abraham.
And, yes, breaking and entry
is one of my specialties.
I'll bet you robbed a girl of her virginity
once, which I find impressive.
- Well, you should. She was your sister.
- Ahh! [Laughing]
What the hell are you laughin' at,
half-wit? Your mama is your sister.
- Hey.
- How did you people pull off
20 scores in three years?
I'll tell you how. We don't know
a damn thing about each other.
- Rule number one in the book of Mr. Elijah.
- [Electronic Ringing]
[Electronic Female Voice]
You have a video phone call.
Good morning, campers. I assume you've
all met and bonded with Mr. Abraham here.
He's a strong addition to our team.
He's an expert in many areas,
mostly the sciences.
- What? Like we're mopes or something?
- Good to see you again too, Job.
I gotta agree with Job on this one.
We've done fine on our own, Mr. E.
Have we? I'm putting Mr. Abraham
in charge of this one.
What? I gotta take orders
from science guy here?
You know, we made a lot of scratch
for you in the past few years, pal.
I don't have to sit here
and take this crap.
Well, then I guess the others will have
to split up your hundred thousand.
- We get a hundred grand each?
- [Elijah] It's big.
But let's see if we can do this one
without any blood on it. Deal?
What deal doesn't have blood on it?
[Coughing]
Isn't this cute?
[Jarod]
What is it?
Brittany Tate?
Who's Brittany Tate?
Last job we did, three months ago,
a kid was murdered.
[Job Coughing]
"Brittany Tate, age nine,
was smothered to death...
"during a robbery
at a Westbrook estate.
"Only evidence found at the scene
was a pillow used in the suffocation...
a spilled bottle of perfume
and a broken music box."
Well, I guess that's what Elijah meant
when he said, "one without blood."
Which one of you geniuses did her?
[Job]
None of us knows.
Nobody's talkin'.
Mr. Cain's gone strangely silent.
- So?
- So, you killed that little girl.
[Chortles] Lady, your brain's
already beginning to melt.
What difference
does it make who did it?
- It's done.
- [Electronic Ringing]
- [Eve Coughing]
- You have a video phone call.
- Tough evening, eh?
- [Job] Tough?
We've all been exposed to nerve gas!
Which means you've accomplished
your mission. Well done.
You set us up? You knew
what we were stealing was deadly!
Would you have taken
the assignment otherwise?
Assignment?
We're dying in here!
One of the canisters leaked.
We've all been exposed to the gas.
I realized that that might be a possibility.
Check the dispatcher's office.
I've left materials there for you
to work a little chemistry, Abraham.
Now, I'm sending a couple of my men over
to pick up the canisters.
They should be at your location
within the next few hours.
And just know the contingency
plans are being implemented.
Forget about contingency.
What about currency?
Patience, Job. Patience.
- My men are on the way.
- [Job] No, no, wait.
Wait. Damn it!
Oh, God.
He's-He's leavin' us here to die.
Shut him up, or I will.
[Coughing]
Elijah will not leave us
high and dry, okay?
What's this stuff?
Elijah left me everything
I might need to create an antidote.
- You think you can save us?
- Now don't you wish you'd been nicer to me?
- Hey, how long?
- Five hours. Maybe less.
How-How do we know
that you can do this?
I was an army medic in Desert Storm.
I know a few things about chemical weapons.
I'm gonna need a blood sample
from each one of you.
Hey, screw this.
This guy could be a wacko
for all we know.
I agree with Cain. I'm gonna take
my chances with the hospital.
You won't make it. And even if you did,
they won't have the antidote you need.
You've got all the answers, don't you?
I'm outta here.
- [Metal Clicks]
- Someone's coming.
[Job]
Cops.
[Radio Chatter]
Hey, come on.
It's empty. Let's keep moving.
[Man On Radio]
Thirteen, Sergeant, One and Central.
- [Door Closes]
- They're gone. We're clear.
[Light Coughing]
We have to do this
before it's too late.
[No Audio]
- Leonard didn't kill anyone.
- God, they just mowed them down.
Rewind, Broots.
Before they get shot.
Who's he calling?
Can't tell.
The image is too small.
Maybe if I enhance the video,
isolate his hands and match the motion.
- You can do that?
- Well, yeah. It would take about an hour.
[Sighs]
Clock's ticking.
# [Piano]
[Abel] Song reminds me
of when Mom used to sing it.
- [Eve Coughs]
- # [Resumes]
[Static Hissing]
Signal's comin' back.
The latest report is that
the security guard, a father of six...
was found nearly strangled to death in
the robbery at MAGNA Technologies, Limited.
His condition is considered
to be life-threatening.
Police are still combing
the area forthe suspects.
Who did it?
Which one of you idiots
strangled the guard?
- What difference does it make?
- It might make a big difference, if we survive.
The question is, which one of you
has the itchy trigger finger?
# [Piano Continues]
[Coughing]
Tell me something. What does
Elijah see in that one?
It's like a horse race entry.
You want Cain, you get Abel.
[Coughing Hard]
I gotta get outta here.
I gotta get out. I gotta-
- Hey, calm down.
- No, I gotta get outta here.
- Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.
- Please!
You know something? I thought I was a really
good judge of people. Guess I was wrong.
What's that supposed to mean?
Thought I was working with professionals.
You snuff out a little girl.
Now a rent-a-cop.
Did you do it?
- What about you, Mr. Job?
- [Laughs]
Yeah, he's got the guts.
Oh, yeah. Killin' a little girl,
that takes a lot of guts.
Face it, you know.
It could've been any one of us.
- Speak for yourself.
- Look, it wasn't me.
Well, one guilty, all guilty.
I'll tell you one thing.
Mr. Sparky and his 2,200 bolts of death,
he doesn't much care.
- What about you, huh?
- Yeah?
You could've popped that guard
just as easy as any one of us.
Yeah. We all know each other. We've been
doing this a while. You? We don't even know you.
No. You don't.
Job will access the main security panel
and break the various door codes...
and control panels
to the security cameras.
Eve, Cain and I will take
the upper floor...
with Eve manning the infrared thermal
sensor, and me securing the target.
You sure the target's
on the upper floor?
It's supposed to be. What I do know
is that it's kept in coldstorage.
That's where the infrared
thermal grid comes in.
- What about him?
- We walk in past the security guard.
The janitor uniforms are already set.
[Chuckles]
Janitor?
Hey, a guy like me is gonna be
hard-pressed to pass for a bucket jockey.
- You have a better idea, Mr.Job?
- Yeah. I do.
I, for one, want to know
who the hell you are, Mr. Peabody.
You know Elijah's rule. Total anonymity.
No names, no pasts, nothing.
- I already broke that rule.
- What? What are you talkin' about?
I swiped your glass from the coffee shop
last week. I had a friend of mine run the prints.
There ain't squat on you out there.
You know what I'm sayin'?
I mean, hell, every decent criminal
I know has got some kind of sheet.
What's the matter?
You never broke the law before?
I broke plenty.
I am just too damn smart,
too damn good...
and like my freedom too damn much
to ever get caught.
But, you, Mr.Job, on the other hand-
[Chuckles]
What's so funny?
Well, let's just say that I ran
a little fingerprint check on you as well.
Do you mind telling me exactly what
determines a lewd act... at a kennel?
[Coughing]
Hey, Simple Simon, fini.
Why is, uh, this guy so much
worse than the rest of us?
Each one of us is different.
[Sighs]
We'll all unravel
at our own genetic pace.
Oh. Well, he's definitely
bringing up the rear.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Abel
and his five-piece concerto.
Well, six, if you count the green bean.
[Grunts]
Leave him alone.
[Coughing] I'm so sorry.
Mama's gonna be so mad at me.
- Come on!
- I gotta clean this up.
- Don't do that!
- I gotta clean this up.
Come on. Get outta there.
Mom's dead!
You idiot! You stupid idiot!
She's dead! Has been for 10 years!
Wake up!
I'm gonna kill the next person
who says a word.
How's it coming already, huh?
- I'm workin' on it.
- Yeah? Well, hurry.
You should sit down. It will
slow the effects of the toxin.
[Coughing, Gasping]
Look, I, uh-
I didn't give you my blood before
because I was worried.
About what?
I'm pregnant.
Four months.
Do they know?
Yeah, sure.
They'd give me a perfect little
baby shower, don't you think?
So what's this gas
gonna do to my baby?
Airbornes-They can't pass
through a placenta.
Actually, your baby's
safer than you are.
Okay.
Y-You can take my blood.
As-As long as it's safe for the baby.
I promise.
- Got it?
- Got it.
Butyou're not gonna like it.
He's dialing 2725.
[Miss Parker]
My extension.
My God.
[Beeps, Rewinds]
Miss Parker, this is Leonard.
I saw something I probably shouldn't have.
Something meant to be burned.
Memo B437.
It's something about an e-mail file
intercepted from your computer.
Miss Parker, you should see this.
- [Gunfire]
- [Leonard Grunts]
Someone broke into your computer.
That's why your e-mail wasn't working.
Doesn't the Centre's system keep, uh...
duplicates of-of all incoming
and outgoing e-mails?
Yeah, in the file allocation dump.
None of us have clearance there.
Get me that e-mail, Broots. Or someone
might find all of us in the dump.
Now I'm gonna die
'cause of Mark Beyer's bike.
Come again.
First thing I ever stole.
You know, it had this speed shifter
and this banana seat.
It was the most beautiful thing
I ever saw.
It was almost worth the cops chasing me just
so I could ride that thing down Arlington Hill.
Where did Elijah recruit these two?
The Boy Scouts?
Hey, look at this.
That Brittany girl, her body...
was found stuffed in a toy chest
just like this, wasn't it?
What the hell is going on?
I mean, the paper is one thing,
but this? This is Elijah!
- He's messing with our minds!
- What difference does it make?
We need to keep our minds in the here and
the now. Who cares what happened months ago?
I agree! The here and now!
Like-Like how I want
my hundred grand. Here and now.
Where's the pay? Huh? Where?
We did the job!
We did the damn job!
[Beeping]
- [Beeps]
- There we go, boys and girls.
- Ready to loop signal on security camera one.
- [Beeps]
- Clear.
- Go.
Security door code is 88656.
[Beeping]
You're clear.
[Eve]
I have infrared readings.
I'm getting extreme temperature drop
in room 2108. That one.
Security camera-
Clear. Security door code is 61684.
You're in the clean room.
The cold room chamber door code is...
202018.
[Beeping]
[Bang]
- Next time, knock.
- Your limo awaits.
Job, are we clear?
Job, are we clear to come out? Job?
- [Jarod] Come on.
- Wait. Job, are we clear?
The hell with it! Come on!
There's no guard.
Where's the guard?
My communication pieces
shorted out. Sorry.
Don't you ever leave me hanging out
like that again. You understand?
- [Alarm Beeping]
- Come on, move! Let's get outta here! Move!
[Eve Coughing]
[Groans]
Myinsides are starting to boil.
- Come on. It won't be long now.
- [Groaning]
I don't want to lose my baby.
- You won't. Not-Not if I can help it.
- [Crying]
Thank you. There's not a lot of
love in this room, you know?
[Coughing]
# [Music Box]
Oh, my- It's her stuff.
- [Job] Whose stuff?
- [Abel] Brittany Tate.
- The dead girl's stuff. It's her stuff.
- What?
- Her stuff.
- What are you babblin' about?
Nothin' in there.
No. No.
No. I saw a doll, and a pillow,
a picture, a music box.
Listen, I smelled perfume.
[Coughs]
The guy's startin'to lose it here.
I don't want to die. I don't
want to die. Not like this. [Gasping]
[Eve]
Oh, my skin's on fire.
Come on, science guy.
What's takin' so long?
Freeze!
Elijah's not gonna like it
if you execute his messengers.
- Elijah?
- Sent us to pick up the gas.
[Cain] Dirty cops as messenger boys?
Typical Elijah.
Hey, man, you got our money?
- What is this? A joke?
- What? What is it?
- There's like 10 grand here.
- Hey, the deal was one hundred grand each.
Mr. Elijah is less than satisfied
with the way the job went down.
He'll be in touch. Until then, if you just
give us the canisters, we'll be on our way.
- Not for 10 large.
- [Electronic Ringing]
- Get over there. Move!
- You have a video phone call.
Where's the damn money
you promised us?
It's going to be much harder to sell now
that it's become such a sought after commodity.
Somebody's going to have to pay for that.
That somebody is you people.
You're scum! You know that?
I'm gonna find you, pal. I will!
Even if you knew where I was, Mr. Job,
you'd never have the nerve.
Well, maybe not him, Elijah...
but you forgot about me.
Now, I'm going to send
your healthy messenger back for our money.
If he isn't here in two hours,
the police get the canisters. Is that clear?
Clear enough. I just hope
you all live long enough.
Oh, by the way, this now ends
your broadcast day.
[Beeping]
Wait a minute. Mirage.
The e-mail was from Edna Raines.
That's impossible.
She can barely speak.
It seems she's had another
moment of clarity.
That's not all.
It's Mr. Raines who stole it.
How would Mr. Raines know
what was in my e-mail?
Looks like they've been monitoring
your m-mailbox since last Tuesday, Miss Parker.
Tuesday? That's the very day Edna
escaped from the institution.
- He must have anticipated her contacting you.
- What was in the e-mail?
Well, the text field was empty.
But there was a video file attached.
- [Typing]
- Play it.
- [Beeps]
- Uh-uh.
The only way to access the actual file is
from the computer it was transferred to.
Mr. Raines's office.
Then what are we waiting for?
I'm bleeding to death.
- Like any of you care.
- [Coughing]
Shouldn't have killed that little girl.
That's what made Elijah so angry.
Now there's the guard.
Which one of you dirtbags
is into suffocation, huh?
Was it you?
[Groans]
What happened that night?
- [Coughing]
- [Siren Wails In Distance]
Oh, what the hell.
You're gonna bleed to death anyway.
A huge estate in Westbrook.
Inside were intelligence documents.
[Scoffs]
Worth a fortune.
Elijah hired us to get 'em.
Whoever found them was supposed
to bring them back to the van.
But somebody got greedy...
decided to take a little
side trip into the guesthouse.
Caretaker's daughter
wasn't supposed to be there.
I think Cain did her.
- Shut up!
- All for a few extra bucks.
- [Crunches]
- Aah!
Shut up!
Shut your mouth!
[Man Coughing]
Mark?
Mark, is that you? Hey.
Look.
I'm really- I'm really
sorry about your b-bike.
- # [Piano]
- [Sniffing]
What's that smell? It smells-
It smells like perfume.
Cut it out, green bean.
- I don't want to hear that song again.
- [Gun Cocks]
Go ahead. Play it again, Sam,
just one more stinkin' time.
I dare you.
[Sniffs]
What is that smell?
Is that the antidote?
[Jarod]
No. It's Champs de Nuit.
- My mother wore it.
- [Helicopters Whir In Distance]
I could smell it when
she'd tuck me in bed at night.
[Scoffs]
Maybe that's a lie.
'Cause I can barely remember
even if I had a mother.
# [Calm]
The ingredients in perfume,
they're known as notes, did you know that?
The perfumer, he acts as composer.
Now, me, I always went for the heart.
Some people, they could
only smell the top notes.
I went deeper to search for the soul.
# [Faster]
Perfume.
Sparkling citrus notes, like lemon.
Dark resonant notes, like balsam.
# [Loud, Heavy]
- [Crash]
- # [Stops]
The medical report just handed to me states
that the MAGNA Technologies Limited...
security guard has died from
injuries sustained during the robbery.
Well, that was smart.
He's dead! Didn't you hear that?
He's dead!
[Jarod]
He ain't the only one.
[Eve] Great. That's one more
corpse on our hands.
Oh, my God.
I'm bleeding. Oh, my God.
You've gotta finish the stuff. I'm gonna die.
You've gotta finish that stuff!.
I'm finishing it now.
Let go of me!
# [Music Box]
Oh, no.
Oh, God, it's her.
It's her. It's the Tate kid.
So what? It's her. So what?
- She's dead! Just like we're gonna be.
- I didn't kill her. All right?
- I didn't say you did!
- It's not even her picture.
I didn't kill her.
Oh, damn it!
Now there's only enough
antidote f- for four of us.
[Eve]
So what does that mean?
[Jarod] I guess that means that
one of is going to die.
The question is, who?
[Helicopter Whirs In Distance]
[Eve] So how do we decide
who gets the antidote?
[Jarod] We'll leave out the one
who killed Brittany Tate.
Only problem is we don't
know who the killer is.
- Well, we do.
- What are you talking about?
Process of elimination. I mean, it couldn't have
been me because I wasn't there, right?
I didn't kill her. I swear.
I didn't kill her. I didn't kill her.
No. I know you didn't.
And I know you didn't.
And I know...
you didn't.
[Gasps] What's going on?
Give me the antidote.
- You don't deserve it.
- What? But why?
Because... you killed Brittany Tate.
Mr. Abraham, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.
Am I? For starters, you're not
really pregnant, are you?
That was just a fabrication so no one would
believe you could ever possibly murder a child.
And I checked your blood for the pregnancy
hormone, H.C.G. [Imitates Buzzer]
- Thanks for playin'.
- The gas is making you crazy.
The most convincing
evidence was Brittany herself.
No one saw her that night
except for the killer.
Her picture wasn't in the papers.
It wasn't on the news.
You were the only one who recognized
that photograph as a fake.
Because you remember what she
looked like the night you killed her.
- [Job] Whoa! Hey.
- Put your gun down. Put your gun down.
Look, if she killed the kid, then she's
the ticket to our money from Elijah.
You shoot me,
I take at least two of you with me.
Starting with little brother.
[Groans]
Uh-oh, bloody nose.
You know what that means.
You tell me the truth,
I'll give you half my dose.
- [Gasping]
- Disintegration of your internal organs.
The complete meltdown of
your psyche. It isn't pretty.
[Sobs]
- The little girl wasn't supposed to be there.
- [Jarod] But she was there!
And you killed her in cold blood
just to assure her silence!
[Gasping]
Oh, I can't breathe!
It doesn't have to be this way.
Tell me the truth, and I'll give this to you.
Yes, I killed her! I killed her!
Now give it to me!
- Oops.
- [Screams]
[All Panting]
Blanks.
Yes. Uh, except for mine.
[Gunshots]
Oh, and his.
I thought you'd never end this.
I almost sneezed.
[Wheezing]
W-What the hell's going on?
I'm not exactly
who I pretend to be.
I'm an agent with the Texas
Bureau oflnvestigation.
I purposely exposed you all
to find out who killed Brittany Tate.
But you were gonna get killed
by the gas too.
There was no Soman gas.
It was just a 12 hour intestinal virus...
with a little kicker to weaken
the sinus cavity and constrict breathing.
Not to mention a mild
herbal hallucinogen.
It's completely harmless.
[Creaking]
[Radio Chatter]
[Eve] I-I don't understand.
The reporter, the cops?
It was all a hoax.
Mr. Elijah cut a little deal to help us.
And to shorten his stay in prison.
Now you see them.
Now you don't.
These were all the last things
that Brittany saw before you killed her.
[Lid Slams]
None of this was real?
Nothing.
Except your confession.
And that's a lifetime of real.
[Radio Chatter]
[Broots]
I'm into Raines's hard drive.
There's the e-mail.
But the video attachment's been deleted.
- Damn it.
- Hang on.
Deleting e-mails is sort of
like losing your car keys.
They're not gone, just lost.
Faint magnetic traces of the original
can still linger where they were stored.
I just have to link all the pieces.
There. I got it.
It's Edna Raines. She sure
doesn't look crazy there.
Maybe she's not.
Play it, quickly.
Miss Parker, I need to talk to you.
It's time that you learned everything
about your mother and Mirage.
Please answer this message as soon as
possible, and I'll send you the where and when.
It could be a matter of life and death.
[Sighs]
For Leonard, it already is.
Let's just hope it's not too
late for the rest of us.
If anyone finds out how we pulled this off,
some heads are gonna roll.
- Starting with mine.
- We caught a baby killer, didn't we?
[Radio Chatter]
Right. I'll see you
back at the office.
- Come book these animals.
- Uh, don't wait for me.
- You have other business?
- Family business.

Let me get this straight.
You buy personal items
for a small amount of money...
you sell them to perfect
strangers for a lot more money?
Is America a great country or what?
- [Bells Jingle]
- Yo, Toni.
- I got a nice surprise for you today.
- You got a job?
Who needs one when you can
find rich stuff like this?
A digital camcorder.
It's got liquid crystal display...
digital something, headphone jack.
Nice!
- Looks like it fell in the river.
- It did.
I found it in the washbasin
below Koomer Falls.
I figure some mope must have been makin'
a home movie and dropped it.
- Give you 20 bucks for it.
- Twenty?
I was looking for
more like a hundred.
Yeah, and people in hell
are lookin' for ice water.
One Andrew J.
Take it or leave it.
You drive a hard bargain.
- [Bells Jingle]
- [Door Closes]
What's a- a home movie?
Did you grow up in
a basement or something?
- Or something.
- You know, mom, dad and the kids...
go off on the great
American family vacation...
and record it for posterity...
in case anybody wants to watch it
without a gun to their head.
I would.
I'd love to.
- How much?
- Hundred bucks.
Sold.
Like I said,
is America a great country or what?
It's Tuesday the 9th,
day four of our vacation...
and today we're officially starting
our trip down memory lane.
Here on the banks of "Kooner"-
- What is this? A stream or-
- It's a creek. Koomer Creek.
Koomer Creek. Yeah.
Well, whatever it's called...
- it's beautiful.
- What?
- [Both Laughing]
- [Girl] I thought this was
gonna be stupid, but it's neat.
Really? You mean Mom's
not a complete moron?
- Well, not complete.
- Ha, ha, ha.
So this all used to be
part of Gramps's land?
Yeah. This is where I grew up.
Right over there on that log
is where your dad first kissed me.
Oh, my God.
Look. It's still there.
- What?
- Look.
Here. Let's get a shot.
"Nancy and Ted."
Dad told me there was
a place near here...
Iike, a cabin or something,
you guys used to go to, to be alone.
Hmm. It's an old mill.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is that where I came from?
- What do you mean "came from"?
Well, you said this trip
was something about my heritage.
- I was just wondering if you and Dad gave-
- [Chuckles] Yeah.
a whole new meaning
to "grinding the corn."
- Let me tell you something, young lady.
- Hitting too close to home.
Um, you know what? I forgot
my fanny pack in the car. I'll be right back.
Okay. You know, this place
actually doesn't suck.
Can't believe you didn't
bring me here before now.
Mom, are you listening to me?
I'm being serious for once,
and she's not listening to me.
[Nancy]
Stop it! No!
- [Girl] Mom, you okay?
- Leave me alone!
- Mom?
- Help!
Mom, are you okay?
If you're joking around, this isn't funny.
This isn't funny.
Where are you?
Mom. Mom. Mom!
- Are you okay? What happened?
- Run. Run.
- What?
- Run. He's- He's coming back.
- [Man] Hey.
- Run.
Help! Somebody help me, please!
[Screams]
- [Man] Shut up.
- Help!
[Screams]
Help, please!
Help me!
Somebody help us, please!
[Screams]
Help me.
[Screams]
[Rewinding]
Somebody help us, please!
- [Beeps]
- Somebody help us! Help!
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because ofwhat I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
Lei gh, honey, move over close to the sign.
Oh, I sure hope this is gonna work.
So, it's Monday the 8th,
day three of our vacation...
and we are here at... Slade.
Oh, guess what, Dad.
She's gonna let me drive for a while.
- Your car.
- [Mouths Word]
[Nancy] Yeah, now, that's pretty.
Boy, Dad's gonna love that.
Do you have to record this?
[Nancy]
Don't you have something to say?
Um, I had a little accident
in your Mustang.
And we need a new taillight. But Mom's gonna
check and see if they have one here.
And I promise I'll pay for it all.
[Nancy]
Yeah, right. Okay, here.
Now, I'm gonna get some gas.
And then I'll check and see
if they have a new light.
[Leigh]
"J.R.'s Service Station."
I feel like we're in Mayberry.
Only it looks like Goober's
had a lobotomy.
Hey.
[Chuckles]
But Barney's got a cute butt.
[Nancy]
Leigh, behave yourself.
- [Leigh] Like you didn't notice.
- What? I didn't notice.
[Leigh]
Yeah, right.
- [Beeps]
- [Pop ]
[Sydney]
Any news from Jarod?
In a manner of speaking.
He's up to his old tricks,
but this time with a new twist.
One that's right up your alley, Broots.
[Snaps Fingers] Sit.
- My alley. Ooh.
- Turn it on.
[Electronic Female Voice]
You have mail.
Well, hello, Miss Parker. I've put together
a little postcard for your viewing pleasure.
Just click and enjoy.
Hey. This is cool.
When Debbie and I go to Rock City,
I can send you one of these.
Now, you've already met Edna...
who despite being locked in an asylum
for decades by her loving husband, Mr. Raines...
is an amazing historian
of the Centre.
Edna knows things about
your mother, Miss Parker.
Things she won't tell
to anyone but you.
She wouldn't even tell me.
Edna wants to come home,
but she can't.
There's an army of Sweepers
out there looking for her.
She told me her redemption...
will be to tell you what
she knows before they catch her.
So you better hurry.
Be careful.
And know that Edna said no matter
what happens, she wants you to keep digging.
That the secret your mother
wanted to tell you when you were little...
is buried out there,
and you need to find it.
- Huh.
- [Beeps]
It's like an electronic trail
of bread crumbs.
That we better get busy following
before someone gobbles everything up.
[Coughing]
- Damn it.
- [Siren Blares]
[Coughs]
- Havin' a little trouble?
- You could say that.
I don't know what happened to it.
I don't believe I've seen you
around here before.
I'm just passing through.
Or I was passing through.
Looks like I'm gonna be
staying here for a while.
Well, J.R.'s just up
the road up there.
Hop in.
I'll give you a push.
- See if we can get you on your way.
- [Taps Car]
[Chattering On Police Radio]
Looks like I'm gonna have
to order the parts from Flagstaff...
seeing as we don't stock parts
for vintage cars like that.
Be tomorrow before
you're up and runnin' again.
I can't imagine what
might be wrong with it.
Corn Man a-comin'.
- The Corn Man?
- Well, you're a stranger.
There's a curse
on strangers come to Slade.
Curse of the Corn Man. That's why
you're having trouble with the car.
- Newt, shut up about that old wives' tale.
- Ain't no wives' tale.
Started when that stranger
showed up at old man Koomer's place...
back in the olden days.
Stranger chopped up the family.
The whole family.
Tiny little pieces.
They found them all down at the corn mill.
The Corn Man's soul ain't never rested.
You can see it lightin'
up the sky at night.
His ghost still haunts strangers
that come into this town.
- I said shut up, Newt.
- You can tell me to shut up all you want.
Corn Man's still a-comin'.
Not that I'm puttin'
any stock in Newt's curse...
but does seem like you've been
havin' a streak of bad luck lately.
I had a couple of women
bash right into me.
They said they were passing through here.
Mother and daughter.
- Driving a red Mustang convertible.
- Oh, they was pretty.
The blondes.
Looked like they could be sisters.
They needed a taillight, as I remember,
but I didn't have one for a '65.
They just got some gas and headed out.
I haven't seen them since.
[Bell Dings]
Fill her up, little brother. And be sure
and put it on the department's account.
You ever get tired of telling me
what to do, big brother?
Brotherly love, you understand?
You must be the guy
the sheriff radioed in about.
Word sure travels fast around here.
Yeah. Well, you know,
we like to stay on top of things.
- Anything I can help you with?
- Actually, maybe you could recommend a motel.
Looks like I'm going
to be here for a while.
Well, Clearwater Inn's
the only one in town.
Don't get much business, except for
an occasional trucker, but, uh, it's clean.
- I can give you a lift.
- Ah, no, thanks.
Actually, I'd- I'd rather walk.
Get to see your town.
Don't blink.
You'll miss it.
Corn Man a-comin'.
- [Beeps]
- [Leigh] The Clearwater Inn.
I've always wanted to stay
at a zero-star resort.
Leigh, try and be nice
for five minutes.
I am being nice.
- [Man] Welcome to Clearwater Inn.
- [Nancy] Thank you.
[Man]
Room's all ready. Room 14.
- [Nancy] Room 14 it is.
- [Man] Presidential suite.
What president stayed here?
Millard Fillmore?
Well, actually,
I just call it that...
so I can charge more
to smart-mouthed kids and their mothers.
[Leigh Chuckles]
Clever.
I'm sure it'll be just fine.
Thank you, Raymond.
Come on. Let's go.
[Beeps]
Hello.
I'd like to rent a room, please.
Fill this out. Be sure and put down
the make and model of your car.
- Actually, I'm going to need a rental.
- Uh, two blocks that way.
- And good luck with what you get.
- Well, it doesn't matter.
Just want to drive around.
It's beautiful here.
[Chuckles]
Well, that's in the eyes of the beholder.
Some friends of mine
seemed to have thought so.
As a matter of fact, I think they stayed here
a couple of days ago. A mother and daughter.
Beautiful, blonde.
Mmm. Don't remember 'em.
I hear you only get
the occasional trucker through here.
Surely you remember
two beautiful women in a red convertible.
Hmm. Well, you'd think I would.
But I don't, because they weren't here.
Here we go.
Think we'll put you
in room number five.
I'll take number 14, please.
It's my favorite number.
Sure.
Fourteen it is then.
Yeah, there's someone here
asking about 'em.
Even knew what room they were in.
Mom. Do you believe in ghosts?
- [Nancy] Ghosts?
- Yeah. You know, the souls of the dead.
They can come back to haunt the living.
I don't know, honey.
I never really gave it that much thought.
[Leigh]
Then how do you explain those flashes?
[Nancy]
It's called heat lightning.
- And it's been happening
around here for a long time.
- Whatever it is, it's freaky.
Like that story that guy was telling me
back at the gas station.
You know, the one that gave me this.
He was telling me about the curse.
- All strangers are cursed.
- Hmm.
It all started back when some Corn Man
hacked up a family out by Grandpa's old ranch.
[Nancy] Honey, that's just an old tale
that people have been telling for years.
It's ridiculous.
- I hope so.
- It is.
Okay.
- Wait. How do you turn this off again?
- Little red button.
- Mom.
- What?
- Mom, there's somebody out there.
- What? Where?
By the tree. He was standing-
He's staring at me.
[Nancy]
Okay.
Look.
[Nancy]
I don't see anyone.
He was right there by the tree.
I swear.
[Nancy] If there was someone there,
they're not there now.
He warned us we'd be in danger.
Maybe he was right.
Maybe the Corn Man's coming, Mom.
[Nancy]
That's not happening.
Go to bed.
How do I turn this off again?
[Owl Hooting]
[Young Sydney's Voice]
Jarod, a 15-year-old girl...
is found brutally murdered
in her bedroom.
Part of an upper-class
community in a small town.
We don't know what happened
between the time she left her friends...
- and when she was murdered.
- What is it you want me to do, Sydney?
Take the evidence.
Use your skills as a Pretender.
Become the victim. Do what she did.
Feel what she felt.
[Leigh]
It's Tuesday the 9th,
day four of our vacation...
and today we're officially starting
our trip down memory lane.
Here on the banks of"Kooner"-
What is this? A stream or-
- [Nancy's Voice] It's a creek. Koomer Creek.
- [Leigh] Koomer Creek.
Yeah. Well, whatever
it's called, it's beautiful.
[Nancy]
This is where I grew up.
[Leigh]
You know, this place actually doesn't suck.
- Can't believe you didn't
bring me here before now.
- [Nancy] Stop it!
- No!
- Mom?
- Leave me alone!
- You okay? Mom?
- Help!
- Mom, are you okay?
Mom, if you're kidding around,
this isn't funny. Where are you?
Mom!
Mom.
[Leigh]
Mom. Mom.
Are you okay?
What happened?
Run. He's-
He's coming back.
Run.
I can't see it, Sydney.
I can't figure it out.
You have to figure it out.
The family is counting on you.
[Screams]
Somebody help us, please!
[Newt's Voice] Corn Man a-comin'.
[Echoing]
Well, mister, you're good to go.
Funny thing, parts shop said...
they never heard of this happening
with this model before.
Well, that is funny.
Not if you're a stranger it ain't.
It's the curse.
That's why I went and made you
this here corn man to keep you safe.
If you're gonna stay around here,
you're gonna need it.
Thanks.
- I think.
- [Bell Dings]
[Man On Police Radio, Indistinct]
Well, I see Kent's got you
all fixed up there...
Mr., uh-
You know, I'm not sure
I got your name.
I'm not sure I gave you my name.
Guess you'll be on your way then.
Who knows? Maybe I'll stick around.
I'm growing kind of attached to the place.
You don't got a job
or a home to go back to?
I'm sort of in between both right now.
Well, I'd advise you get
one or the other.
Idle hands are
the devil's play things.
I don't plan to be idle.
I'm not too fond of strangers.
I hope the Corn Man don't get him.
- Any luck finding Edna?
- [Broots Clears Throat]
I've enhanced this photo from Jarod's e-mail.
There's no one we recognize in the crowd...
but from the signage and license plates,
it looks like a street scene in New York City.
- Somewhere in Harlem.
- [Broots] Hmm.
- [Beeps]
- [Jarod's Voice] Edna wants
to come home, but she can't.
There's an army of Sweepers
out there looking for her.
She told me her redemption...
will be to tell you what
she knows before they catch her.
- So you better hurry.
- Hmm.
Home. Redemption.
Of course. One of my mother's
favorite charities...
was a halfway house in Harlem
called Redemption Home.
[Broots]
Jarod's telling you that's
where you can find Edna.
[Doorbell Rings]
- Mr. Wright?
- Mm-hm m.
I have to talk to you
about your wife and your daughter.
- There's been some trouble.
- Trouble? What do you mean?
I- I just spoke with them.
- When?
- This morning.
They said they were fine.
What's the problem?
We've had a minor car accident.
Well, that's strange.
Nancy didn't mention anything about it.
That is strange.
That car must mean a lot to you.
Actually, it was your daughter
who was driving. Leigh.
She backed into me.
Uh, your wife gave me the name
and number of your insurance company...
but I- I seem to have misplaced it.
Is your wife expected home soon?
No. They're both still out of town. Look. All my
insurance is handled through Western Mutual.
But, you know, I prefer
to handle this myself.
So why don't you get an estimate,
and I'll send you a check for the full amount.
Yes, but I would not- Uh-
I'll be in touch.
Somebody was here.
He was asking about them.
Tall guy. Dark hair.
[Electronic Twittering, Beeps]
[Horns Honking]
[Broots's Voice]
Edna Raines is in this building.
Here in room 24.
But the guy said that I was the second person
to look for her in the last half hour.
- [Sydney] Raines.
- [Raines] What the hell are you doing here?
What the hell are you doing here?
She was my wife.
- Was?
- [Sydney] Edna Raines is dead.
An overdose.
How convenient.
I can only assume
she couldn't face the world any longer.
With you in it, who could blame her?
I'll miss her so much.
Is that why you kept her
locked up for 30 years?
That was to protect her.
You never protected anyone
but yourself, Raines.
You can bury her again, Raines.
Along with all the secrets
she died for.
- Sheriff.
- Yeah.
- We need to talk.
- [Phone Rings]
Uh, just a second there, sir.
Yeah. Sheriff's office.
What? No.
Your brother's not here.
Yeah. He- He is the deputy, Kent.
He's on patrol.
Yeah. I'll tell him
to call you when he gets back.
All right. Okay.
Sorry about that. What, uh-
What's the problem now?
- I found something, and I want to show you. I was-
- [Phone Rings]
Damn it.
Sheriff's office.
Yeah. Uh, listen.
I can't talk right now. Um-
I understand. I-
I'll get right back with you.
Soon. All right? Yeah.
- Just stay there.
- [Door Closes]
[Engine Starts]
[Birds Chirping]
[Sheriffi's Voice]
Wake up.
I said wake up!
Start talkin'.
Talkin' about what?
Everything you know
about Nancy and Leigh.
From the beginning.
I know they disappeared four days ago.
And I know that Mr. Wright here has taken out
a rather large insurance policy on them.
Hey. What the hell are you sayin'?
I'm sayin' that
you and the sheriff here...
have conspired to murder
your wife and your daughter...
- so you could collect insurance money.
- Murder?
- Pal, we're trying to save them.
- That why you tried to kill me?
- Kill ya? We found you.
- You kidnapped my wife and daughter.
- You're gonna tell us where they are.
- Kidnapped?
I didn't kidnap them.
I'm here to find them.
Look. There's a camcorder over there.
There's a tape in it. It will explain everything.
[Beeps]
- Are you okay? What happened?
- Run. Run.
- What?
- Run. He's- He's coming back.
- Run.
- Help!
- [Man] Hey.
- Help me, please! [Screams]
Help.
[Screams]
Help!
Somebody help us, please!
[Ted]
Oh, my God.
Who the hell are you?
I was on vacation when
this sort of fell into my lap.
- Jarod Wilson, U.S. Marshals.
- [Ted] A fed.
- Damn it, Frank. He finds out, he's gonna kill them.
- What are you talking about?
Four days ago I got a call. A man.
He said if I wanted to see
my wife and daughter again...
to get $500,000 by tonight...
and not to contact the authorities.
Ted got a hold of me and made me promise
I wouldn't bring in any outside help.
We've been, uh, friends
since high school- and Raymond here.
Then you started sniffin' around,
and we figured you were involved.
Do you think it's someone local?
Well, a lot of local people are aware
of Ted's financial success and his family.
To tell you the truth,
we don't have much to go on.
And even less time.
[Sydney's Voice]
I was Edna Raines's therapist.
I can assure you that she wouldn't have
taken her own life- at least not willingly.
Edna knew she was in danger.
That's why Jarod was
so cryptic about her location.
- [Beeps]
- [Jarod's Voice] Be careful.
And know that Edna said no matter
what happens, she wants you to keep digging.
That the secret your mother
wanted to tell you when you were little...
is buried out there,
and you need to find it.
Buried? But where?
Who's the most adept
at burying things around here?
[Gulps]
Mr. Raines.
[Printer Whirring]
Got the cash.
Everything's ready to go.
He should've called by now
to tell me where to drop the money.
He's going to call, Mr. Wright.
Just be patient.
I don't want to be patient.
I want my family back.
Ted, he's on our side.
[Cell Phone Rings]
Keep him on the line
as long as possible.
Tell him you demand
to speak to Nancy-
that you won't make a delivery
until you know that your wife is safe.
- [Ringing Continues]
- [Computer Beeps]
- [Beeps]
- This is Wright.
[Beeps]
[Man] Put the money in a duffel bag.
At midnight, you, and you alone-
[Distorted Voice] will take it and leave it in
the trash bin at the bridge on Long Tunnel Road.
- I want to talk to my wife.
- [Man] You're not in a position to make demands.
I am not paying $500,000
for two dead bodies.
[Nancy Whimpers]
- Ted?
- Nancy.
Oh, Ted, thank God.
Are- Are you and Leigh all right?
Yeah. We're a little ground up,
but we're, um-we're alive.
Just hang in there, sweetie.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Ted, I love you.
I love you too.
Both of you.
- Midnight.
- I'll be there.
I got it.
[Bird Squawking]
[Ted On Walkie-talkie]
I made the delivery.
[Sighs]
All right. It's been over an hour.
I haven't seen anything yet in my position.
How about you, Raymond?
[Ted]
Yeah. Do you see anything? How's it goin'?
- Nothin' so far.
- [Frank] Well, keep your head up.
- Jarod.
- I don't like this, Sheriff.
- He should've shown up by now.
- [Raymond] Jarod, I think I got something.
- [Gunshot On Walkie-talkie]
- Damn! Raymond!
- Raymond, can you hear me?
What the hell happened?
I saw the guy coming straight at me.
[Sighs]
He was on a motorcycle.
I thought I could stop him.
Next thing I knew I was down.
- The bullet entered from behind.
- [Owl Hooting]
How can that be?
There are two kidnappers.
[Elevator Bell Dings]
Never again. You hear me?
Don't even ask. Never again.
- Calm down and check your pants.
- [Sighs]
- Now tell me what you found.
- Nothing. Well, almost nothing.
- [Clears Throat]
- Excuse me.
I cross-referenced everything in Raines's files
with Edna's name, and the only thing-
the only thing I came up with...
was section "G," 14, dash, six...
in a communique intercepted
by Raines from Edna to you.
Wh- What?
Section "G."
Row 14, plot six.
That's my mother's grave.
Jarod's e-mail said to keep digging.
The answers... are buried out there.
You don't think Jarod
wants you to dig her up?
Miss Parker, it's your mother's grave.
Get shovels.
We've got work to do.
- [Sighs]
- [Ted's Voice] They're dead.
If the kidnappers haven't killed them already,
they will now for sure.
[Sighs]
What are you doin'?
I'm gonna watch this video again.
Maybe I missed something.
Can't believe you didn't
bring me here before now.
[Leigh] Are you okay?
If you'rejoking around, this isn't funny!
- Well, not complete.
- Ha, ha, ha.
[Young Jarod's Voice] I've studied
the evidence and read the interviews, but...
it just doesn't make sense.
The answer's right in front of you.
Everything you need is there.
- But I can't see it.
- But she can.
See what it is that she sees.
Look, Jarod.
Look hard.
Did you see that?
What?
That.
The answer's there.
It was there the whole time.
She sees him.
[Frank]
Adams? He was in the parking lot?
[Ted]
Adams? Who's Adams?
- My deputy.
- And one of the kidnappers.
- Then who's the other one?
- My guess is his brother Kent...
from the gas station.
- So these guys have gone to kill my family?
- Not if we get to them first.
Wait a minute.
- Listen to this.
- [Ted's Voice] Nancy.
- [Nancy] Oh, Ted, thank God.
- Are you and Leigh all right?
We're a little ground up,
but we're, um- we're alive.
We're a little ground up-
We're a little ground up-
- I don't understand.
- "Ground up."
On the video,
Leigh kept referring to an old mill.
Yeah, near my father-in-law's ranch.
Nancy and I used to go there all the time.
You wife was trying to tell you where
she and your daughter were being held.
Let's go.
Let's just hope they're still alive.
- [Crickets Chirping]
- [Owl Hooting]
[Broots] You've made me do a lot of things
I don't want to do, Miss Parker...
but this has gotta be the worst.
What if someone finds us?
Then you'll just have to hold them off
while I go for help.
Oh, great.
That's-That's lovely.
Row 14's over here.
[Thunder Rumbling]
- [Clank]
- [Broots Whispers] Whoa. Sorry.
- I feel like I'm in a Scooby-Doo cartoon.
- [Owl Hoots]
- Wait. What was that?
- Settle down, Shaggy.
It's an owl.
[Owl Hooting]
This is it.
Miss Parker, this just isn't right.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Jarod's done a lot of twisted things...
but he would never lead me here
just to torment me.
[Thunder Rumbling]
Now dig.
[Vehicle Approaching]
[Vehicle Door Opens]
- Where the hell have you been?
- Wright tipped off the sheriff.
- We gotta get out of here.
- No one followed me.
That's because I put a bullet
in the leg of the guy who could've.
What about them?
This wasn't part of our plan.
Yeah, well, plans change,
little brother.
They can identify us.
[Grunts]
[Grunts]
Leigh, now! Run!
I'll get the daughter.
You take care of her.
Damn, mom. That hurt.
If that's the way you're gonna be-
Oh, I don't think so.
[Groans]
- Nancy.
- I'm fine.
But Leigh- She ran out,
and the deputy went after her.
[Panting]
[Panting, Whimpers]
[Panting]
[Adams]
You can't get away.
[Groans]
Get away from me!
Don't work that way.
- It's nothing personal. You understand.
- Please. I want to go home.
- Just business.
- Please. I want to go home.
- The only place you're going is
in Koomer's Creek!
- No! [Screams]
Stop screamin'.
No one can hear you scream out here.
I can.
Come here!
[Groans]
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- [Sobbing]
It's okay.
[Whispers] It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.
- [Nancy] Leigh.
- Go. Go.
- Leigh.
- Leigh.
Baby. Oh.
I don't know how to thank you, Jarod.
Just take care of them.
I will.
You ready to go?
Let's go home.
[Thunder Rumbling]
[Thunder Rumbling]
Well, this is it.
Miss Parker, are you sure
you want to do this?
- Ah.
- Huh?
[Sighs]
- Open it.
- Miss Parker-
- [Sighs]
- Why don't we just get the hell out of here...
- and let her rest in peace?
- [Sighs]
I want to rest in peace.
Now open it.
Are you sure?
Go ahead.
[Grunts]
Oh, my God.
- What?
- Miss Parker, your mother-
She's not in here.
Then where the hell is she?
[Miss Parker]
Jarod, I'm only going to ask you this once.
How did you know
she wouldn't be there?
- I didn't.
- Then who?
Edna did.
She knew all the secrets.
Especially about the Mirage Project.
Unfortunately,
she took them to her grave.
Well, I am sorry for you.
Edna was someone you could've trusted.
Unlike the Centre.
Or my family.
You were right in putting
your trust in your mother.
She knew the importance of family.
Of helping people.
If she kept any secrets from you,
it was to protect you.
Protect me from what?
The truth.
Keep searching, Miss Parker.
But remember.
You can't believe everything you see.
After all, life is a mirage.
Sometimes the things
that scare you the most...
can be the things
that save your life.
[Beeps]

Previously on The Pretender.
Enough!
We don't want him dead.
[Tires Screeching]
Nice to meet you, Jarod.
I'm Zoe.
- [Jarod] I want to stay with you.
- [Zoe] I know.
But you can't stay, can you?
I can see it in your eyes.
[Jarod] Edna Raines knows things
about your mother, Miss Parker.
I need to talk to you
about your mother and Mirage.
It could be a matter
of life and death.
[Sydney]
Edna Raines is dead.
She knew all the secrets,
especially about the Mirage Project.
[Miss Parker] Jarod's e-mail
said to keep digging.
It's your mother's grave. Miss Parker,
your mother- she's not here.
Then where the hell is she?
Oh, come on. Everybody's been on
at least one vacation.
I swear, Zoe,
I've never been on vacation.
Not even, uh, Mount Rushmore?
- The Alamo?
- Mm-mmm.
What about Niagara Falls?
I definitely would have
remembered that.
Wait, I did eat at a "Stookey's"
off of I-65 once. Does that count?
"Stuckey's." Only if
you bought the pecan log.
- What's a pecan log?
- Oh, you really have never
had a vacation, have you?
Who needs a vacation...
when I have you?
You swear to me
you're in total remission?
Yeah. I probably pissed off
a few H.M.O.'s, but what the hell?
- Zoe-
- Hey.
You're not going
all mushy on me, are you?
- [Ringing]
- [Electronic Voice]
You have a video phone call.
That's my video phone.
- Um, I'll be right back.
- Okay.
[Ringing Continues]
- Hello, Son.
- Oh, my God! Dad!
I've been searching for you for over a year.
Where have you been?
I know. The boy and I
had to go underground for a while.
We kept searching for you too,
but with no luck...
until an anonymous tip came my way.
I was able to unscramble your password,
which got me into you here.
- Then you're both okay?
- Thank God the boy and I are both well.
- The boy?
- He's sort of like my brother. I'll-
I'll explain it to you sometime.
Dad, this is Zoe.
- Zoe, this is my dad.
- Jarod's been pretty damn worried
about you, sir.
He's cute.
What happened to you?
When can I see you?
We have to be careful.
I don't trust the security of this line...
so I'll make it quick.
Jarod, I found Emily.
I found your sister.
What? How? Where is she?
She's a reporter at the Philadelphia Examiner.
For security's sake...
I've left vital information about
her where abouts on your secured e-mail.
She told me that recently,
she was very close to finding you.
She cried when I told her
I knew how to reach you.
I think you should go to her.
- Will you bring her back to me, Jarod?
- Yes!
- Yes, of course I will.
- Good luck, Son. Keep me posted.
My- I found my dad.
Um-
My- I-We've been looking
for my sister for so long...
and now I found her, and I can, uh-
Um-What about our trip?
It can wait.
We'll have time.
And if I have any say in the matter,
lots of it.
You're not gettin' all mushy on me,
are you?
Go find your sister.
[Man]
Somebody call 911!
[Woman]
She's in the alley!
- What happened?
- A reporter was attacked.
- They say she was thrown out of that window.
- A reporter?
An Emily something.
Emily? Emily!
Emily? Emily?
- Please help me.
- That's what I'm here to do.
I'm going to help you.
I'm Jarod. I'm your brother.
- Jarod.
- Stay with me. Stay with me.
- [Gasps, Coughs]
- Emily? Emily?
Somebody call an ambulance!
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.
How many people died
because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
- Pupils are unresponsive.
Respiration is shallow at 40.
- Pulse is weak and thready.
Probable closed head injury with
internal bleeding and multiple fractures.
Keep her head stabilized.
Start an I.V. drip and run a C.B.C.
Page Radiology. We need
an abdominal and head CAT scan, stat.
- Who initiated C.P.R.?
- I did.
Your actions may have saved her life.
Are you a doctor?
No.
[Jarod]
I'm with the F.B.I.
- The victim is someone we've had
our eye on for sometime now.
- Why?
Let's just say that a few of her journalistic
choices have struck a nerve in D.C.
The victim's office is in here.
Name's Detective Brookins.
Call me Stan.
Agent Jarod Curtis.
Tell me what you know,
the whole story.
Well, the victim came to
the office early this morning.
So early, it was the night shift janitor
that probably saved her life by walking in.
Anyway, from what I can tell,
the woman was ambushed here...
then thrown out this window
two stories to the pavement.
- Any description?
- White male, 35-ish, average build, dark suit.
Got the sketch artist
workin' on it now.
I want all of her files boxed and
sealed and sent to your precinct.
And I'm also gonna need
an office for a few days.
[Miss Parker]
Well, it's about time you got back, Lyle.
So, what's the flavor of the day,
little brother?
Mail-order mamas from Malaysia?
Or cannibal quiche from the Kalahari?
- If you're here to talk with our father, he's gone.
- Well, then find him.
[Chuckles] Pounding boilermakers
is hardly the breakfast of champions.
This isn't about you.
I'm sorry.
Okay, now I know you're sloshed.
What's going on, Parker?
[Sighs]
It's-
It's about our mother.
She's gone.
- Our mother's been dead a long time.
- No.
I mean, she's not there.
I mean, her-
She's not there?
What do you mean she's not there, Parker?
Parker?
You wouldn't understand anyway.
- But I wanna know.
- Bet you do.
[Electronic Female Voice]
Message voice box 04. Record.
- [Beeps]
- It's me.
I've got a bad feeling Miss Parker
knows about Catherine's empty grave.
[Sydney] You believe
someone stole your mother's body?
Except for this scotch-induced
earthquake rattling between my ears...
I'm not sure exactly
what to believe anymore.
Let's face it, Sydney.
Catherine Parker's body being gone...
fits in with all the other
bizarre happenings around here.
The reappearance of Edna Raines who,
after 30 years, everyone thought was dead.
And who now really is dead, thanks
to the bald butcher she called "Hubby."
The murder of that harmless
clerk Leonard down in SL 26...
because he just happened
to see the wrong memo.
And now, Catherine Parker's empty grave.
That's a lot of strange coincidences.
No. Not coincidence.
Mirage.
Mirage? You mean what Edna Raines
told you before she died?
What was on both of those memos,
the one I found on Lyle's desk...
and the one that killed that clerk.
Well, oddities, yes...
but status quo here at the Centre.
I never thought I'd hear you say...
"Murder is business as usual," Syd.
All I'm saying is, at times...
it is best to let some things go.
My mother's grave is empty, Sydney.
Maybe, just maybe, she had otherwishes
that you didn't know about.
For her burial, I mean.
People sometimes make choices...
that are difficult to explain.
No.
This is one big fish I'm reeling in.
Broots, our best evidence-
We follow the body.
In this case, my mother's.
We start with the autopsy records.
Parker?
Why won't you let go of this?
Because something inside me
is telling me to do this.
And I'm listening.
Her condition is only fair,
Agent Curtis.
- So please minimize your time with her.
- I will. Thank you.
Em?
It's your brother...
Jarod.
I was too late this morning.
I'm sorry.
But I'll never be late again.
I promise you.
[Lyle]
How goes the world tour?
Indeference to Winston Churchill...
or whoever the hell said it...
"The sun never sets on the Centre."
And I'm making sure it never sets
on the Parkers either.
- [Elevator Bell Dings]
- Glad to hear it.
Since when is Raines
hosting Triumvirate personnel?
He'll be a blip on our radar as long
as everything goes well with Mirage.
Unfortunately,
we've got company there.
I've all but confirmed
that Sis is on that same track.
- Ah, damn.
- Oh, it's nothing.
She's way behind the curve.
I'll make sure she stays there.
I don't want her knowing
for her own good.
Hell, if she knew the truth,
she'd only wish she didn't.
- Okay.
- [Crunch]
- God! What'd I just step in?
- I don't know.
- But if you hurry, you can still catch it.
- Ew!
[Sydney] I can't believe you actually found
Catherine Parker's autopsy files, Broots.
Well, I haven't found it yet.
But, according to Buzzie...
the only way to download
a visual archive in the Sublevel...
is to tap directly into the Sublevel's
mainframe terminals.
- Who the hell is Buzzie?
- My pal down in Communications.
You know the old guy
with the hearing aids?
He's always griping about
the constant ringing in his ears.
- I've got that problem myself.
- Get this.
You know the rumor that J.F.K.
was kept alive as a vegetable somewhere?
Buzzie claims it was
right here in SL 18.
Yeah, right next door to the alien corpses
Nixon showed Jackie Gleason.
- That was here too?
- [Sydney] Hey!
This is Room 12.
This is it.
[Broots] Wow. This is the room
where they did your mother's autopsy.
- This shouldn't take long.
- [Zipper Unzipping]
Sydney?
- Parker, you okay?
- Fine, Syd.
- I got it.
- [Raines] This begins the visual data archive...
to be known as number 566773.
The autopsy of Catherine Elaine Parker.
Date and time to follow.
Dr. William Raines, M.E.
Versatile guy, that Raines.
Beats 'em, bursts them,
slices and dices.
[Raines]
Initial findings indicate...
a single gunshot wound into
the cranial region as cause of death.
Angle and force of the head wound...
strongly indicate the gunshot
was self-inflicted.
- [Drill Whirring]
- Let's just skip to the end, Broots.
Oh, God. We've heard
all these lies before.
I just need to see
where the body goes.
Box the body for transport
per the family wishes.
On a personal note, I would simply like to go
on record to express my heartfelt remorse...
and to say that this is
and will always be...
a tragic death in
the annals of the Centre...
the likes of which I hope
never to encounter again.
So, what now?
We do a little exploratory
surgery of our own...
see just how remorseful
Dr. Death really is.
[Man] I'm as sorry as I can be
about the attack on Emily.
I wish all my tenants were like her.
I sort of connected
with her right off-
her lookin' for her family...
me not ever knowing
my father and mother.
I'm sorry.
She was so close to changing
all that for herself.
- What do you mean?
- Well, she was hot on the trail
of her brother.
Said she was, like,
this close to finding him.
She'd tear up everytime
she talked about it.
When was the last time that you saw my-
uh, the victim?
Um, must have been
a couple of nights ago.
To tell you the truth,
she seemed a little tense.
Said something about being, uh,
close to a big discovery.
The brother that she was looking for?
I-I don't think so.
This was something disturbing to her.
It wasn't a happy discovery.
Did you find something?
I'm not sure.
Uh, thank you for your time...
but I'd like to look around
for a little bit.
Sure. Hey, you saved me a trip.
I was about to go into town and tell the police
about this guy that was hanging around here.
It-It was the same guy from
the police sketch in the evening paper.
I-I can't believe they left out the most
important part of the description.
What's that?
The fact that-
Well, the guy was missing a thumb.
- [Women Laughing]
- [Lyle] I've never even met you.
Who said anything about breakfast?
Mr. Lyle?
Something tells me you haven't
read the morning's paper.
You try to kill with kindness,
and this is what happens.
Put a team together.
We're goin' back to Philly A.S.A.P.
Right.
Allow me.
I'm not going to Sublevel 18.
Oh. But you should.
It's a regular "Freaks-R-Us" down there.
You know the history.
J.F.K.., dead Martians. The room
where you did my mother's autopsy.
It's gonna be a bitch gettin'
that tank up and down the stairs.
It's common knowledge
I performed your mother's autopsy.
But... is it common knowledge...
that my mother's body
isn't in her grave?
What are you talking about?
What the hell did you do
with her body, you ghoul?
What any responsible
medical examiner would have done-
honor the wishes of the deceased.
If you have a problem with that,
take it up with her...
because this discussion is over.
Miss Parker, you told him
about your mother's empty grave?
He's gonna-
He could- He could-
He could lead us
right to the answer.
[Broots]
You told him on purpose.
That fish I said I'd be reeling in-
I just baited the hook.
Now we troll.
- You with us, Syd?
- [Elevator Bell Dings]
[Woman]
I'm sorry, Agent Curtis...
but I cannot in good conscience
allow the victim to be transferred.
How would your conscience feel when they put
you in jail for violation of a federal order?
- That order is worthless in my eyes.
- I have seen her charts.
Her edema levels are back to normal,
as well as hervital signs.
- The answer's still no.
- Whoever tried to kill her knows he failed...
and he will be back to finish the job,
I guarantee you that.
Releasing her to the next of kin
would be my only option here.
And correct me if I'm wrong...
but so far, none have turned up.
Until now.
I'm Emily's father...
and I think you should give
the agent here what he wants.
I'll prep her for immediate release.
- It's so good to see you.
- How is she?
- She's going to be okay.
- Great.
[Tires Screeching]
Check over there.
Willie, stairs.
You, follow me.
- How many were there?
- Four.
Go! Go!
238.
Damn! Where did she go?
- Released. She just went downstairs.
- Take the stairs.
That ambulance over there is mine.
I know a place that we can be safe.
You drive.
Good way to get yourself killed, pal.
Out of my way.
- See this woman come this way anywhere?
- Nope. Never seen her.
[Siren Wailing]
Damn!
I wanna thank you, Sister Mary,
for everything you've done for us.
After all you've done
for our parish, Jarod...
- you just stay as long as you want.
- [Bells Tolling]
And we'll take
very good care of Emily.
Nothing.
- No luck, huh?
- It's like he doesn't exist.
Well, whoever this guy is,
Emily's been tracking him for a while.
Here, let me give you
a hand with the notes.
"Misplaced personality disorder."
"Man with no name."
"Talks to voices."
"Enigma."
Maybe it's a story
she's been working on.
Or a lifelong mystery
she's been trying to solve.
She thought this guy
might have been you.
She's been searching, just like me.
Just like... we all have.
Why would the Centre
want to murder her?
And how does he fit in?
[Broots]
Boy, you put the worm on...
and he took it hook,
line and sinker.
Man.
But I never pegged Raines
for the rustic type.
In the middle of nowhere,
you can't hear anyone scream.
I need to get to that fire.
[Miss Parker]
Anything, Broots?
Looks like a Raines time capsule.
Everything from old mortgage papers
to his kid's kindergarten artwork.
Move over, Monet.
Looks like "Ethan."
His son?
I've tried not to fire too many synapses
remembering things about the Raines family.
You think Raines used to live here?
Well, we used to visit
his house occasionally...
but it was on
the other side of town.
Maybe he used this place
as some kind of personal storage depot.
Yeah. Well, no offense
against his kid's artwork...
but this is starting to feel
like a dead-end trip down memory lane.
Miss Parker?
I think another street
just opened up.
Huh. St. Christopher medal.
Miss Parker, look.
[Emily Moans]
Emily? Emily?
Hi.
It's me, Em.
It's your brother.
- Jarod?
- Dad's here too.
We're all together now.
[Mutters]
Take your time. Take your time.
What is it you wanna tell us?
I found this picture
in your research files.
You thought he was me, didn't you?
Who is he?
Ethan.
- Ethan?
- He hears the voices. Talks-
He talks to the voices. I read that
in your notebook. What voices, Emily?
Hey, I think she should rest.
Come on.
Okay.
NuGenesis.
NuGenesis?
My God.
The Centre Fertility Clinic?
I have no fond memories of that place.
Here.
"AA8585."
Is that a file number?
- From NuGenesis?
- Does that have anything to do
with this man Ethan?
Follow NuGenesis.
Follow him.
Follow him.
Emily? Emily?
You know, if you consider yourself
any kind of friend of hers...
you'll destroy those disks.
- And you will destroy it now!
- But I can't!
I can't, Sydney. I don't really
have a choice in the matter, do I?
I mean, this is Miss Parker's life.
- This is her past.
She has every right to see it.
- See what?
Do what you must, Broots.
But I won't be a part
of opening this Pandora's box.
[Miss Parker]
What Pandora's box?
[Broots] I was able to reconstruct
one tiny piece of the disks...
we found at Raines's forest house.
- The same place we were today?
- Yeah, but- Just watch.
[Raines] I hope you're feeling
comfortable here, Catherine...
after all you've been through.
I never thought I'd see the day when I'd be
thanking you for your kindness, Dr. Raines.
But thank you.
- My mother was there.
- Yeah. But what's important is the date.
Look. Look at the date code
on the D.S.A.
Your mother was shot and killed
at the Centre in April.
- This says June. There must be a mis-
- No.
It's physically and
technically impossible...
to alter the dates on the Centre
D.S.A. surveillance system.
Sydney didn't want me to show you this.
I don't know why.
But it's a lock.
Your mother did not die
in that elevator, Miss Parker.
Are- Are you saying
my mother is still alive?
Your mother alive?
Does this make any sense?
- Do you think that was hers?
- I don't remember it, but anything's possible.
Keep decoding the forest house archives.
And don't tell anyone.
- Not even Sydney?
- Especially Sydney.
He's done everything except
handcuff me to a freight train...
to keep me from digging into this.
There must be someone you can trust.
Where's Angelo?
Looks like the same kind
of insanity I grew up with.
Are you sure this is the address
Emily gave us for Ethan?
Positive.
He's been videotaping
himself for years.
Is there anything
on NuGenesis AA8585?
Nope. But there's enough material here
to write a dissertation on bomb-making.
But this guy's taken it a step further.
He's designing his own bomb.
Huh. Look.
There's an unmailed letter...
to his parents, the Clausens.
According to this time code, this video
was made less than one hour ago.
There's your little bomb-maker.
Let's see what he's been up to.
Just leave me alone!
- Who's he talking to?
- I know I shouldn't yell.
I won't be bad anymore.
According to Emily's notes...
there were signs of erratic behavior,
of multiple personalities.
He must be wrestling with
some kind of demons inside.
Emily said he could hear the voices,
whatever that means.
[Phone Ringing]
Yeah?
Hey, hey, listen.
I'm in trouble.
I need to talk to you.
Yes, I'm-I'm almost ready with 7677.
I-I just need a few more components.
But I'm tellin' you, I need to talk.
You swear that after the explosion...
the pain will be gone?
They're promising him his inner torture
will end if he pulls off some kind
of bombing for them.
- The Centre.
- Who else?
Okay, I'll do it.
First, I wanna see my mom and dad.
Why won't you let me see
my mom and dad? It's been so long.
I-I-I wrote them a letter.
Why can't I send it?
They do love me!
I know.
I know you do too.
[Line Disconnects, Dial Tone]
[Grunts]
- What? Are you sure?
- What's he doing?
- He's talking to the voices.
- He's gonna- He's gonna hurt my mom and dad?
He can't hurt my mom and dad.
[Major Charles]
Wherever he's going, he's not coming back...
and he's taking his bomb with him.
Come on.
Let's go.
It's not my fault that Jarod found
his sister before the Sweeper team did.
It's your fault she was still alive.
Well, what did you teach me
about water under the bridge?
If it gets deep enough, it'll drown you.
What about Mirage?
- We're still searching.
- Oh, that's perfect.
My daughter is searching for a ghost...
my son is searching for a monster.
Last one alive wins, hmm?
[Angelo]
Secrets and lies.
Secrets and lies.
When it comes to the Centre, Angelo,
secrets and lies are like oxygen.
Lies.
Angelo, I need you
to empath this for me.
It may have belonged to my mother.
Your mother wore this.
Her journey not over.
My mother is still out there?
Illusions are real.
What's that mean?
Mirages are real.
What's "Mirage," Angelo?
Mirages are real.
Tell me what that means!
Miss Parker. He-
He's on your side.
Angelo sorry.
He doesn't know the answers.
But Sydney knows.
Sydney knows all the secrets and lies.
[Sobbing]
Oh, please.
Please don't be dead.
Please.
[Sobbing]
Don't leave me.
- Please don't leave. Please.
- [Voices Whispering]
You did this.
No, I swear I didn't do this.
You hurt them!
Why? Why?
Ethan, I didn't hurt them.
I swear to you.
I did not kill them.
- [Voices Whispering]
- Somebody hurt them.
Somebody killed my parents.
Please, let me help you.
- Help?
- My sister Emily...
- she followed you because
she wanted to help you.
- [Sirens Wailing]
- That's all I want to do.
- There's no help for me.
- [Tires Screeching]
- Not from you. There's only
one person who can help me now.
Ethan! Ethan!
- Freeze!
- I'm F.B.I. It's okay. It's okay.
F.B.I.
- There were reports of shots fired.
- Upstairs. Two bodies.
I was too late.
You knew my mother was alive,
but you didn't tell me?
Yes.
Then give me one good reason not
to blow your Flemish brains out.
I promised her I wouldn't tell you.
[Sighs]
Well, as you know...
I gave your mother
her last psychiatric session...
less than an hour
before her supposed murder.
- Supposed suicide in the elevator.
- "Supposed."
What does that mean, Sydney?
Catherine?
Catherine, please relax.
Sydney, I just found out that
someone I love is planning to kill me.
- Who?
- I can't tell you. A friend.
But it's forcing me to-
to make a very difficult decision.
I'm going to stage my death
in hopes of saving my life.
- I don't understand.
- And I don't have time to explain it all.
But you know these people,
what they're capable of.
I try not to imagine.
Their latest is
a project called Mirage...
and they've made me a key player.
My only way out is dying,
by their hands or my own.
[Sydney]
This is dangerous talk.
These are dangerous times, Sydney.
I'll do what I have to to survive.
And then I'll come back and rescue
Jarod and Angelo and my little girl.
What about your little girl?
She's my gift from God...
and I don't know how to save her
without causing her this pain.
Promise me, Sydney.
Swear to me that you'll protect her...
that you'll never tell her about this.
- You owe me.
- I know I do.
Whatever happens, no matter
how badly she wants to know...
I don't want my baby girl
to ever have to face the true tragedy...
of her family's secret.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
Godspeed, Catherine.
An hour later,
the gunshot rang out.
You know the rest.
I never saw Catherine again.
- Do you know what it is?
- What?
Mirage. The tragedy...
of my family's secret?
I'm afraid I don't.
That is the truth.
Ethan's parents were murdered
as a message to him.
Finish the 7677 bombing, or else.
Sounds like a message from the Centre to me.
- That has the Centre fingerprints all over it.
- This too.
- You hacked into the NuGenesis mainframe?
- Uh-huh.
And you won't believe
what I found in file number AA8585.
[Jarod]
AA8585 was a shipment...
of cryogenically frozen sperm samples.
They were airlifted
to the Centre decades ago.
Someone wanted
to get pregnant pretty badly.
Yeah, but they weren't
just anyone's samples, Jarod.
They were mine.
- How much does Jarod know?
- [Lyle] We're not sure.
But Major Charles's seminal records
have been compromised at NuGenesis.
[Lyle] And there's more.
Jarod was spotted at the parents' house.
- Before or after they were killed?
- After, thank God.
- And Mirage?
- [Sighs]
He's still out there.
There's gotta be some way to get
to Jarod before he beats us to him.
There is one.
We give him something...
more important to go after.
Something named Zoe.
[Mr. Parker]
Good thinking, Mr. Cox.
[Major Charles]
It only gets stranger and stranger.
- More on your records at NuGenesis?
- Yeah.
For the past 25 years,
comparative genetic test follow-ups...
have been conducted using my D.N.A.
The question is, who or what
are they comparing it to?
It doesn't say. But the results
were sent to a private residence...
in Blue Cove, Delaware.
Come on.
[Engine Starts]
Okay, let's go.
You all right?
Something feels... weird.
- We're talkin' Mr. Raines.
It's supposed to be weird.
- No.
This is weirder than him.
- What are we lookin' for?
- The truth.
I'll check over here.
No.
It's not over there.
How do you know, Son?
I just know. It's-
It's like a strange deja vu.
- What are you mumbling about?
- I decoded some of the archives
from the forest house.
And, well, if a picture's worth
more than a thousand words...
I think I've just
uncovered a thesaurus.
This is about six months
after your mother supposedly died.
- Well?
- He'll be here in a few minutes.
- You sure you wanna do this?
- [Sighs]
I have to.
- What? What did she have to do?
- Well, wait. Just watch that door.
Like you've seen this place before?
It's like I've been here before.
[Gasps]
Oh, my God.
Jarod out of the Centre?
Impossible. How could that be?
Secrets and lies.
- Hi, Jarod.
- Hello, Mrs. Parker.
Thank you for coming.
Close the door.
Gynecological instruments?
What is all this stuff?
Tools of the trade.
- A birthing table?
- The question is, whose?
Come here, Jarod.
There's something I wanna tell you.
My mother was pregnant?
You're going to have a brother.
[Major Charles]
This is just too weird.
Birthing tables, incubators...
genetic follow-ups of my semen.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I have a brother.
I have a brother?
Jarod and I share a brother?
It must be Ethan.
- But where is he?
- [Ethan] My parents are gone.
Mom is dead.
Dad is dead.
[Raines]
I'm your father now.
[Sydney]
Details are sketchy, Jarod.
I'm just now trying to piece
a lot of this together myself.
This feeling is so strong, Sydney,
that I've been to that forest house before.
But my mind wants to block it out.
I have a feeling too, Jarod,
and it says you're lying.
- Miss Parker.
- I'm glad to hear your mind
hasn't blocked me out yet.
Tell him, Syd.
Like he doesn't know.
Well, we saw the D.S.A.,
and you were definitely there.
- Then why don't I remember it?
- [Miss Parker] You're the genius.
- You tell us.
- If I could I would, Miss Parker. You know that.
I've never held back
when it comes to your mother.
[Miss Parker] You were on
the D.S.A., Jarod. She talked to you.
- She told you secrets.
- I don't remember.
- Did she tell you why she faked her own death?
- I don't know.
Or how in the hell that baby
she was carrying is your brother?
- Look, I don't know.
- Or where she was going,
or where the baby went, or-
I don't know!
[Sydney]
It is entirely possible that...
your subconscious mind has
blocked out those recollections, Jarod...
either by itself or with
the help of someone else.
So those memories could
still be in Jarod's head?
Every waking moment of our lives
is stored somewhere in our minds.
[Jarod] Well, for what it's worth,
Miss Parker, I believe that-
that our brother is a man named Ethan.
Now, I don't know where he is...
but somehow he's involved
with a project called 7677.
You figure out 7677..
you find baby brother.
[Ethan]
I'm almost ready with 7677.
I just need a few more components.
But I'm telling you,
I need to talk. Okay.
[Grunts]
Still nothin' on this guy, Agent?
- Still nothing.
- [Man] You can't drag me
out of my house like that!
I got a whole grilled cheese
goin' right there on the stove.
Hey, where do you want him, Detective?
- Come on!
- [Brookins] Ask, and ye shall receive.
That's the local munitions guy
you asked us to haul in.
Name's Jed Sidel.
Small-time middle man, all-around weasel.
Well, what a coincidence.
Weasel season has just opened.
Jed.
- Agent Curtis, F.B.I.
- Hello.
On behalf of the Bureau,
I would like to say congratulations.
- Hmm?
- Well, you're moving up in the world.
- I am?
- Aiding and abetting in the making ofbombs.
Helping to murder innocent citizens.
I mean, this is hardly fencing stolen TVs.
You're hittin' the big leagues.
Your parents must bevery proud of you.
- You got the wrong guy.
- Really?
Well, he doesn't seem to think so.
I don't know who that is.
- That wasn't my question.
- What-What-What was the question?
Why are you helping
your friend here make bombs?
- No, no. Ethan ain't no friend of mine.
- Ethan?
I thought you didn't know him.
Do you have any idea what this guy's
gonna do to me if I spill to you?
I mean, he talks to people
that aren't even there. He's crazy.
Unlike the lovable lifers
in federal prison.
- Hmm?
- I hear shower time's a real scream,Jed.
Explosives. Yes.
He was looking for explosives.
Like C-4, Semtex, uh, digital fuses.
And all I did,
and this is all I did...
was call a guy on the phone, and I-
and I set up a meeting.
- That's it.
- Where and when?
Mm-hmm.
At the warehouse at midnight.
Broad Street and Franklin.
[Engine Starts]
There was only about
one minute of stuff left on the D.S.A.
But what's there is really telling.
Dr. Raines, leave us alone, please?
Catherine, I don't think
that would be a good idea.
I think it would be a great idea.
Jarod, there's something
I have to tell you...
that you can never forget.
Okay.
I may not live much longer,
and if I don't...
there's something very important
I want you to tell my daughter.
Will you promise me
that you'll tell her?
I promise.
It's something I don't ever
want anyone else to hear.
What's wrong, Broots?
Fix it.
Well, there's nothing to fix.
She unplugged it. That's all there is.
My butt that's all there is.
Make it talk.
- I-I can't.
- My mother's dying secret.
The one thing
she wanted me to know...
is not only lost electronically,
but somewhere inside Jarod's head...
and he can't remember a thing.
Hmm.
Raines. Raines must have
erased that portion of Jarod's brain.
- You mean, like, hypnotized him
or brainwashed him or something?
- Very likely.
I don't know how Raines locked
that memory in Genius Boy's mind...
but I'm gonna free it up
if I have to crack his head open...
and carve it out
with a melon scooper.
- How are we gonna do that?
- We track Raines.
I'll bet my ass
he knows where Ethan is.
We find Ethan, we find Jarod.
Move in, Sam!
[Chattering]
Relax, son.
Everything's going to be just fine.
I feel so alone.
But you're not, Ethan. I'm here for you.
You know that, don't you?
After you earn the trust
of the Triumvirate with the bombing...
you'll come to live at the Centre
where we'll do great things together.
I'll be calling you soon.
[Door Opens, Closes]
Ethan? It's okay.
I'm not here to hurt you.
No, you're the one
who killed my parents.
I didn't kill your parents.
[Voices Whispering]
How do you know I can trust him?
I can't trust anyone.
Not you, not him.
Ethan, I'm your friend.
- [Chain Rattling]
- Ethan, run! Run!
[Gunshot]
[Miss Parker]
Jarod!
Damn it!
Jarod! Your ninth life just ran out.
[Miss Parker]
You look surprised to be here.
Well, I'm surprised I'm still alive.
Dead men tell no tales.
I'm assuming since we're here, this has
nothing to do with Centre business?
No.
It's about me.
I need your help.
Tell me what I need to know,
and you're out of here.
And I should believe you're going
to let me just walk away? Hmm?
Watch this, Jarod.
- [Young Jarod] Hello, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you for coming.
Close the door.
Come here, Jarod.
There's something I wanna tell you.
You're going to have a brother.
[Jarod] I don't remember this.
Sydney, I don't remember this.
[Sydney]
It's in your mind somewhere.
Then let's get it out.
Three, two, one.
Go back into your memory, Jarod...
to when you were a young boy.
Are you there now?
Go back to a moment when Raines came
to take you from the Centre.
And where did he take you?
[Jarod]
A house in the woods.
- Can you see the house now?
- Yes.
Go inside.
- Are you there?
- Yes.
I smell wood. Wood paneling. Cedar.
Very good, Jarod.
I walk through a sliding door.
- She's there.
- Who is?
Catherine Parker.
She's still alive.
Hi, Jarod.
She didn't die in the elevator.
- She seems troubled.
- By what?
She wants me...
to tell her daughter
something very important.
What?
It's very important that
she know the truth about Ethan.
Ethan?
That's what he told me
his name would be.
I don't understand.
How would he know?
- How do you?
- I call it my inner sense.
Inner sense?
For most, it's the hairs
on the back of your neck...
or that nervous feeling
in your stomach.
[Jarod, Mrs. Parker Together]
For me, it's voices I hear all around me...
usually warning me of things
that are about to happen.
Like souls talking to you?
Something like that.
I've been blessed
with this gift, Jarod.
And though she doesn't know it,
so has my daughter.
Though neither of us quite like Ethan.
Ijust pray his gift isn't
abused by the wrong people.
[Young Jarod]
Why are you telling me this?
Because Ethan is also your brother.
Unknown to me, while I was sedated...
for a minor surgery not long ago...
my husband...
used your father's seed
to impregnate me.
- My father's genetics.
- Yes.
Mr. Parker wanted
to create a child...
with this inner sense...
who could also
be special like you are...
to use, no doubt,
as they have used you.
Mr. Raines showed me proof
of what had been done...
and that Mr. Parker
is planning to kill me...
when the baby is born.
[Young Jarod] Mr. Raines scares me.
Why do you trust him?
I trusted him because-
because he trusted me.
That and...
it was the only way for me to give
this child a chance at a real life.
But now-
Something's wrong.
The voices are telling me
I won't leave this house alive.
[Young Jarod]
That's why you brought me here.
You're special, Jarod,
and I know you won't forget.
I want you to tell my daughter
to complete my plan.
[Young Jarod]
Plan?
She'll understand one day.
Just tell her to trust her inner sense.
It will guide her actions.
Jarod, your soul is a trusting one,
just like your mother's.
- You know my mother?
- Yes.
And one day,
you'll be back together again.
And Ethan will help you find her.
[Jarod, Mrs. Parker Together]
Trust your inner sense.
[Typing]
- Mr. Lyle.
- Any news from Cox about Zoe?
According to his last message,
he's ready.
But this is why I'm here.
Our people at Triumvirate Headquarters...
thought you might find that
quite interesting.
Raines has been a busy boy.
[Broots] I intercepted a communique
between Raines and the Triumvirate...
and I'm probably
not the only one who did.
- Spit it out, Broots.
- It's about 7677.
And that thing, that Mirage-
That "thing" is my brother.
Whoa.
Okay. In a nutshell,
there's some project called 7677.
And if it goes off as planned, Mr. Raines
is gonna be in charge of the Centre.
A Raines coup.
Thank you.
Hello?
Why do I feel Iike you know
what Broots just told me?
- Raines has been working towards
this his whole sordid career.
- Using Ethan.
He took him as a child,
placed him in a surrogate family...
with people who would allow
Raines to control his emotions.
In other words, screwed him up
so badly, he would only trust Raines.
So Raines could have
total control over him...
turn Ethan into
his private assassin.
And when Raines killed
his surrogate parents...
he severed all emotional ties to anything
connected with the outside world.
[Jarod]
Well, that is what Raines does best-
take people away from their families.
What are you going to do?
[Sighs]
I don't know.
Do what your mother would have wanted.
Finish her work.
Work she died trying to accomplish.
My mother may still be alive, Jarod.
What if she's not?
You can stop Raines.
I don't know!
Ow!
Trust your inner sense, Miss Parker.
I do.
Now...
I'm going to find my-
our brother.
Have I ever told you...
how truly inspired this Holy Roller
gag of yours has been?
What are you talking about?
Oh, come on.
You're about as born-again as I am.
But, hey, after you botched things
so badly last year...
this religion thing saved your ass.
There's no shame in that.
Of course...
the way the Triumvirate's been touting
you lately, who needs divine intervention?
- You're making no sense.
- Oh, I am.
Just as much as this communique that
I intercepted from the Triumvirate does.
You've gotten pretty tight
with our bosses in Africa.
7677 and Mirage.
Your power play.
Ringin' a bell?
How did you get this?
If you can find God,
I can sure as hell find that.
And to think all this time,
I thought Bobby Bowman...
was your only special
project on the outside.
I guess you never heard of progress.
What I'm about to propose
is all about progress.
- What do you want?
- I want to run the Centre with you.
The 7677 bombing goes down...
Mirage- or is it Ethan-
comes into the Centre just like you
promised the Triumvirate...
and it all can happen
because I decide...
not to tell Mr. Parker
that you stole his son.
Yeah. That you stole
his prizes Project Mirage.
Now, if I read
that communique correctly...
it's about time for you
to activate Ethan...
and finish 7677.
What do you say, partner?
[Ringing]
[Raines]
7677 is a go.
This is your final call.
After this, it's up to you.
Now, walk three blocks
to the bus station.
Open locker number 9...
and you'll find the final instructions
for the bombing.
[Voices Whispering]
We couldn't stop him now
even if we wanted to.
Happy?
- [Door Opens]
- Damn happy.
- You son of a-
- Hey, hey.
Is that any way to talk
to your new partner?
Whoops.
I mean, new boss?
[Man]
We have a clean trace on the call.
We'll monitor Ethan until he finishes 7677,
and then we'll bring him in.
- No screw-ups.
- Lock him up down in SL 25...
with the rats.
We've had too many years and too much
success for things to end this way.
Who said it's ending for me?
# [Man Singing]
# [Singing Along]
- # [Continues]
- Excuse me?
Hi. Anything I can do to help?
As a matter offact, there is.
# [Continues]
[Bells Tolling]
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How are you feeling?
- Better.
We have so much we have to catch up on.
I'm going to find Mom...
and we're all going to be
together like one big family.
And what about Ethan?
Dad told me everything.
He's not crazy...
not like you thought he was.
Our brother, he's gifted.
He's special.
Don't let them destroy Ethan
like they did our family.
I won't.
I promise.
Sweet dreams.
Why the glum looks?
Well, I recovered more of
the forest house archives.
- And?
- Sit down, Parker.
[Raines]
I can see the head, Catherine.
[Groaning]
- It's a-
- [Mrs. Parker] Boy.
[Raines]
You're right. It is a boy.
Oh!
Hello, Ethan.
Hello.
I'm your mother.
I have such big plans foryou.
- Why didn't you want me to see this?
- There's more, I'm afraid.
After my work was through, I wanted
to raise you and your brother and sister...
like a real family.
But I'm not gonna be able
to do that, little man.
I just realized I'm not going
to be able to seeyou grow up.
But you have a brother and sister
that will find you and protect you.
You tell them to finish my work...
to finish my plan.
I love you.
[Crying]
- Um, I don't think you need to see-
- No.
I need to know.
I'm sorry.
I'm just following orders.
[Mrs. Parker] You really had me convinced
that you had changed...
that you cared about this baby.
There's no other way, Catherine.
[Gunshot]
Raines just executed her.
[Baby Crying]
- Have her cremated.
- Yes, Doctor.
I'm your mommy now.
Raines executed my mother.
He won't take my brother too.
Syd, talk to her.
There's nothing left to say.
[Major Charles]
You found Ethan's computer?
At the warehouse where
he picked up the bomb components.
I reconstructed the hard drive and was able
to break down the bomb schematic.
But even better, I found out
where the bombing is going down.
7677. It's the number of a subway train.
- D.C. Underground.
- The subway's not his target.
It's his delivery system.
Train 7677's route
ends at Freedom Station.
Directly above that
is the National Hotel.
The exact place where hundreds of foreign
dignitaries are staying for a peace conference.
So much for peace.
I broke down the password
on a well-hidden encryption file.
Ethan's programmed the bomb's timer
on this laptop too.
The train is leaving the station
in exactly one hour from now.
- It's just enough time to stop this
and save Ethan.
- Come on.
- [Ringing]
- [Electronic Voice] You have a video phone call.
I'm sorry to call so late, Jarod,
but I thought for sure you'd be interested...
in saving the life of a close friend.
[Groans]
Ouch!
- Zoe!
- Jarod!
- Lyle, let her go!
- That's exactly what I wanna do.
But Mr. Cox actually wants to exploit
the safety and well-being
of your girlfriend...
to his advantage.
All right.
What do you want?
To propose a quid pro quo.
Don't, Jarod!
I don't know why these people want you...
but they will kill you, I know that!
[Mr. Cox]
If you want Zoe to live...
you'll surrender yourself to us
tonight at Rosing's Farm...
Highway 12, outside Blue Cove...
in exactly one hour.
Lyle! Damn it!
One hour from now. That's exactly when
Ethan will be on that subway train.
[Rats Squealing]
From the bottom of my heart,
Miss Parker-
From the bottom of my heart,
Miss Parker-
My first memory of you
was in the Centre lobby.
You were smoking a cigarette.
I was six or seven,
and you knelt down...
took a drag and blew smoke in my face.
And here you are...
still blowin' smoke.
For what it's worth, Miss Parker-
I can never have my mother back...
but I can damn well save my brother.
You tell me everything you know
about 7677...
and I consider
letting you live another day.
I'm the last chance saloon here,
Raines.
7677 is a Washington D.C.
subway train...
departing from Beacon Station
in a little over one hour from now.
Then what?
When it pulls into Freedom Station...
the subway and everything
above it will blow up.
It's your brother who will plant
the bomb and guide the subway.
- Our Father, who art in heaven-
- Not so fast.
Before she died, my mother said
something about her "unfinished work"..
about her "plan."
What did she mean by that?
- Then you never found it either?
- Found what?
Word has it your mother left a D.S.A.
explaining exactly what her plan was.
But it was the one piece
of incriminating evidence...
I never found or destroyed.
You find it, you find her plan.
You gotta know
something more about it.
It's about what everything's about,
Miss Parker.
It's about the Centre, all the lies.
Just remember...
whatever answers your mother
may have left behind...
there is still one person alive...
who does know the whole truth.
- Who?
- [Gunshot]
[Sighs]
Daddy?
It's not right for my little girl
to have blood like that on her hands.
Was it the blood
you were worried about...
or the truth?
Jarod should be here in 20 minutes.
Take your positions.
Be ready.
[Mr. Lyle]
And you're sure he'll come?
Oh, he'll come.
Zoe, we couldn't have
done this without you.
- Go to hell.
- All's fair in love and war.
You know, it's too bad
you're not Asian.
But maybe when all this is over, we can
find a place for you in our renewal wing.
- Why can't you just leave Jarod alone?
- Because he belongs to us.
[Screams]
[Coughing]
- It's not Jarod!
- It's Major Charles.
[Cell Phone Ringing]
- Dad?
- It's me- Zoe.
- Then you're all right?
- Yeah, everything's okay on this end, Jarod.
Though I am pretty damn curious
about who Cox and Lyle are.
- I am so sorry that you got involved with this.
- Be careful, Jarod.
I will.
Ethan?
- Stay away!
- I'm not going to hurt you.
- [Voices Whispering]
- [Grunting]
- They say not to trust you.
- No, they don't.
- Not all of them.
- I wish I didn't have to hear them!
It's your inner sense, Ethan.
It's what makes you special.
- Who are you?
- I'm your brother.
- She told me about you.
- She?
Of course.
One of the voices.
She's the one you must listen to, Ethan.
- Who is she?
- Your mother.
You never got to know her.
They never allowed you to know her.
But she is your mother.
She's your guide, Ethan.
Listen to her voice.
It's your inner sense.
- Mr. Raines is my guide.
- No, he took your gifts
and he used them against you.
He taught you to fear those voices
instead oflearning how to embrace them.
He used you, Ethan.
He's still using you.
Don't let him use
your gift for destruction.
- I have to follow his word.
- If you do, then innocent people will die.
That's not you, Ethan.
That's not who you are.
Just listen to her voice, Ethan.
Focus on her voice.
Trust him, Son.
Jarod is the one.
Listen to her.

Yes.

You can break free of the hold he has
over you. Just listen to her voice.
You have a family now, a real family.
We'll always be there.
Now tell me, where is the bomb?
You can't stop the train.
The bomb can't be defused.
I was on three bomb squads and two
army demolition units. I can defuse it.
The bomb's on the undercarriage.
There's no stopping it or the train.
Then we're gonna have to send the train
somewhere else. Where's Freedom Station?
- It's on the track veering right.
- Where's the track veering left go?
It's to an abandoned maintenance yard.
They closed it years ago.
- Well, hang on.
- Look, it's no use.
I programmed it to automatically
take the track to the right.
- Did I tell you I was a rocket scientist too?
- 3,000 yards.
- 2,900.
- Come on!
2,800! Do it!
- I got it.
- The train has an auto brake
that engages in 40 seconds.
- The bomb goes off 20 seconds after that.
- Come on! Get out of here!
Freeze it, please!
- Miss Parker, listen to me.
There is a bomb on board.
- I know!
- We have less than 60 seconds.
- Then defuse it!
I can't!
It's underneath the train!
- Then stop the train!
- It's too late!
If we are lucky, this train will
slow down enough for us to jump off.
But I can't stop the explosion.
This is your brother,
Miss Parker. Our brother.
It could be a beginning.
Don't make it an end!
[Mrs. Parker's Voice]
I'm your mother. I love you.
You sound just like her.
[Jarod] It's your mother's voice
he can hear, Miss Parker.
Maybe you can hear it too.
Trust that voice.
Miss Parker?
The auto brake has engaged.
We have less than 20 seconds.
- [Groans]
- What's the matter with him?
Side effects of Raines's work.
Now what's it gonna be, Miss Parker?
Help me save him.
Help me save our family.
It's your choice.
Come on.
Put your arm around me.
Go!
- [Miss Parker] Now what?
- [Jarod] We jump!
Now!
