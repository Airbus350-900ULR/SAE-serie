Senor Ambassador.
This is really most humiliating,
Signore Bedoli.
What could be so important...
...that you drag me from my bed
before 7:00 in the morning?
The duke has called an early meeting.
He wanted you to attend.
Monsieur.
Why are the French here?
That is what His Grace
wants to talk to you about.
French bastards! Bastards.
- Mr. Pace.
- Mr. More.
His Majesty wants council
this afternoon to be brief.
- He doesn't want a lot of speeches.
- Where is the king?
He's in seclusion
and not to be disturbed.
- How is he?
- With regards to...?
With regard to Italy.
What the French are doing in Italy.
- What other regard is there?
- His Majesty is counselling patience.
Yes, but you're his secretary.
You see him every day.
In private, he's mad with grief.
Almost inconsolable.
I think you ought to remember
it was his uncle they murdered.
The king.
My lords.
We meet to consider questions
of great moment.
The king of France has demonstrated
to the world his aggressive policies.
He's already overrun
five or six city-states in Italy.
He's a threat to every
Christian nation in Europe...
...yet he bullies the pope into
declaring him Defender of the Faith.
On top of that,
to prove that nobody can touch him...
...he has our ambassador in Urbino...
...and my uncle...
...murdered in cold blood.
My lords...
...I believe these are all just causes
for war.
Your Majesty is certainly right.
You have every reason
to prosecute a war.
I warned you a year ago
about French ambitions.
It has taken this personal tragedy
for Your Majesty to accept my word.
Norfolk.
I agree with my lord, Buckingham.
The king of England...
...has an ancient and historic
right to the French throne...
...which the Valois have usurped.
It's high time we kicked them out.
We should attack France
with all our might.
Yes.
What say you, Wolsey?
I concur with Your Majesty.
These are indeed just causes.
Good.
Then it is settled.
We are to war with France.
Yes.
Your Eminence
will make all the arrangements.
Now...
...I can go play.
Do you really think
we should go to war?
I think we should try to do
what the king wants us to do.
What if the king
doesn't know his best interests?
Then we should help him decide.
How is your husband?
My husband is extremely jealous.
He's threatening to make a scandal.
Says he'll put me in a nunnery.
That would be such a waste.
His Excellency the French ambassador
and Bishop Bonnivet.
Gentlemen, welcome.
Your Excellency.
What happened in Urbino?
The butchering of our ambassador
was most unfortunate...
...especially for me.
Your Excellency is aware of
my sentiments towards your country.
I've laboured long and consistently
in French interests.
But how to explain this?
The murder of my king's uncle.
Well, frankly, it was not done
on my master's orders.
And those that committed the crime
have been punished.
Now, you must understand,
we are well beyond that.
King Henry is a young man.
He has an appetite for war.
And on this occasion
he will not be easy to appease.
Then, by all means, let us have war.
With the greatest respect,
you don't mean that.
Well, I believe that everything
humanly possible should be done...
...to avoid a war between
our two countries.
It would do England no good to get
involved in our European squabbles.
Far better she stands above them.
I'm sure Your Eminence
has ways of pacifying the young lion.
- Strike.
- Play on.
Fifteen-love.
- Thirty-love.
- Yeah!
Our game, I think, Anthony.
Your Majesty knows
we're letting you win.
Actually,
I was playing as hard as I can.
Now, there is someone I have to try.
See her? Middle gallery, blue dress?
See that exquisite, virginal face?
Who is she?
Forty-love, game.
She's Buckingham's daughter.
- A hundred crowns you don't succeed.
- Done.
How is our daughter?
She's well.
You know, her tutors say
she has exceptional talents.
Especially in music.
You should be proud.
I am. You know I am Catherine.
Mary's the pearl of my world.
You have not answered
my nephew's letters.
Your nephew's the king of Spain. Does
he think I have nothing better to do?
You know he advises you
to sign a treaty with the emperor...
...recognising France
as our mutual enemy.
He also advises you not to heed
everything Wolsey tells you...
...because Wolsey
is so biased for the French.
Since when are you a diplomat?
- I am my father's daughter.
- You are my wife.
You are not my minister,
you are not my chancellor, but my wife.
I should like to be your wife
in every way.
Henry, will you not visit
my bedchamber, as you used to?
Eat.
Gown.
Your Majesty.
Where is Queen Catherine?
Her Majesty is still at prayer,
Your Majesty.
Tell Her Majesty...
...I came to offer my love and devotion,
as her true husband.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Jane.
Your Majesty.
- Do you consent?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Three points, Earl of Portland.
Mr. Charles Brandon
has now entered the lists.
Your Majesties.
My Lady Buckingham.
Would you do me the honour
of letting me wear your favours today?
Lord Hallam challenges a plaisance.
Two points, Mr. Charles Brandon.
His Grace, the Duke of Buckingham...
...will now joust a plaisance
with the Earl of Newcastle.
Another three points for His Grace.
Does Your Eminence have a plan?
A way to avoid war?
This is the outline
of a new peace treaty...
...uniting the English with the French.
- May I?
- No.
I want you to take it away
and read it very carefully.
I believe it represents something new
in the world of diplomacy.
If your king accepts it in principle,
he can sign it without any loss of face.
Indeed, he can rejoice.
My master can rejoice.
We can all rejoice.
In which case, what does
Your Eminence want in return?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Nothing from you.
What I want, Your Grace,
only you can give me.
The Duke of Buckingham
has reentered the lists.
He's won 10 courses already.
What is he trying to prove?
- I'm gonna take him.
- No. I'll do it.
I'd love to damage
Buckingham's pride.
My lords,
the king has entered the lists.
His Majesty makes the challenge
a la guerre.
Here we go again.
Claim or no claim,
Buckingham's not the king.
Not all of the court is as loyal as you,
Charles.
My lady.
His Majesty wins the day.
The king.
And easy.
Present oars.
- Thomas.
- Your Majesty.
This is my family.
Your Majesty.
My wife, Alice.
Alice, won't you kiss the king?
Mistress Alice.
Your Majesty.
Shall we walk by the river, Thomas?
I like walking.
Why won't you come live at court?
You know perfectly well why.
I don't like it.
My legal practise
and my life are here.
The court is for
more ambitious men.
You didn't say much in council
last month.
- About what?
- Going to war with France.
As a humanist,
I have an abhorrence of war.
It's an activity fit only for beasts...
...yet practised by no kind of beast
so constantly as by man.
As a humanist, I share your opinion.
As a king, I'm forced to disagree.
Spoken like a lawyer.
- You should know. You taught me.
- Not well enough, it seems.
- Are you finished?
- Yes.
- Harry. Harry.
- Easy.
I must urge you...
...that instead of spending ruinous
amounts of money going to war...
...you should spend it
rather on the welfare of your people.
Thomas, I swear to you...
...I intend to be a just ruler.
But tell me this:
Why is Henry V remembered?
Because he endowed universities?
Built alms houses for the destitute?
No. He is remembered because
he won the battle of Agincourt.
Three thousand English bowmen
against 60,000 French.
The flower of French chivalry
destroyed in four hours.
That victory made him famous,
Thomas.
It made him immortal.
He has no right to any of this.
His father seized the crown
on the battlefield.
He had no claim, only through
a bastard on his mother's side.
Your Grace's family is more ancient.
I am a direct descendant of Edward II.
This is my crown, and this is my court.
Not his crown or his court.
- That's treason, Your Grace.
- It's the truth.
And one day...
...we shall make it come true.
Your Grace.
My Lord.
My Lord.
What's this?
- Brandon.
- It's what it looks like, Your Grace.
You violated my daughter.
No, no, she begged.
You've taken her honour.
I swear to Your Grace,
someone else was there before me.
You son of a whore.
- Yes, that is true, Your Grace.
- I should kill you for this.
Get out.
Eminence, Lady Blount is here.
Very well.
Your Eminence.
What can I do for you, Lady Blount?
I am with child, Your Eminence.
Yes.
It is His Majesty's child.
- You are certain?
- Yes.
Have you told the king?
No.
Good.
I will inform His Majesty in due time.
In the meantime, you will say nothing
to anybody on pain of death.
Do you understand?
When you are no longer
able to hide your condition...
...you will be removed
to a private place for your lying-in.
And there you can give birth
to your bastard.
Thank you, Your Eminence.
Will you bless my sick child?
Your Eminence, please.
All my lords and masters,
make way for his Lord's Grace.
Away. Get back.
Please, you're my last chance.
- Your Eminence.
- Mr. Pace.
I trust you're keeping a good eye
on my interests?
Of course, Your Eminence.
Like an eagle.
Or an eagle, Mr. Pace.
They can soar too high.
Be a pigeon and shit on everything.
Yes.
- Where's the king?
- Out hunting.
Good. It keeps him in good humour.
- Send word when he returns.
- Yes, Eminence.
Who are you? What is it you want?
I have letters of introduction, sir.
But these are from the dean
of Canterbury Cathedral.
- Yes, sir.
- Why did you not present yourself?
- Thomas Tallis.
- Yes, sir.
And you can play, it says,
the organ and the flute...
...and can sing
more than moderately well.
Anything else?
Yes, sir. I compose a little.
Indeed.
Well,
if the dean commends your talents...
...we shall have to see, won't we?
Thomas.
I trust Your Majesty
enjoyed hunting today.
How are the preparations going?
Very well. Both your army
and fleet are assembling.
Stores and provisions are being laid in.
You could go to war...
...in a matter of weeks.
Excellent.
I knew I could depend on you.
I am grateful to Your Majesty.
What is it?
Your Majesty, wars are expensive.
To pay for them
you have to raise taxes.
That's not always popular.
What if Your Majesty could gain more
power and prestige by other means?
Other means?
Peaceful means.
What? No battles? No glory?
I think Your Majesty
should hear him out.
In the past few weeks, I have
conducted, on Your Majesty's behalf...
...an intense round of diplomatic talks.
Not just with the French ambassador.
Also,
with representatives of the emperor.
With envoys from Denmark, Portugal,
the Italian States and so on.
What for?
- To make a treaty.
- What kind of treaty?
A treaty of universal
and perpetual peace.
How is it to be effected?
In several stages. In the first place,
there would be a summit meeting...
...between the kings of France
and England.
At the summit, Your Majesty's daughter
would be betrothed...
...to the French dauphin.
At the end of the summit,
you would both sign the treaty.
The treaty is entirely new
in the history of Europe.
Committing all its signatories...
...to the principles of collective
security and universal peace.
How would it be enforced?
If any of the signatory countries
suffer aggression...
...all the others would immediately
demand that the aggressor withdraws.
If he refuses, within one month
the rest would declare against him...
...and continue
until peace is restored.
The treaty also envisages the creation
of pan-European institutions.
In some ways I like it.
I recognise it.
- So do you, Thomas.
- Indeed.
It's the application of humanist
principles to international affairs.
Your Eminence
is to be congratulated.
I do not seek praise.
Your Majesty would be known as the
architect of a new and modern world.
And that would be reward enough.
Always be assured of our love.
Good night, gentlemen.
- What is it?
- Your Majesty...
...the Duke of Buckingham
insists upon an audience.
Your Grace.
Your Majesty ought to be aware that I
have discovered Charles Brandon...
...in flagrante delicto
with my daughter.
Mr. Brandon has brought
shame to my family.
I demand that Your Majesty
banish him from court...
...with whatever other punishment
Your Majesty sees fit.
There will be no punishment.
Unless your daughter
accuses Mr. Brandon of rape.
Does she so claim?
Does your daughter claim
Mr. Brandon raped her?
She doesn't need to. The offence
is against me and my family.
As far as I know,
there has been no offence.
So there is no need
for any punishment.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Grace.
Be careful of Buckingham, Harry.
He may be stupid,
but he is richer than you are.
And he can call upon a private army.
Not even your father crossed him.
I'm very happy
that the King of France...
...has agreed to sign the treaty
and to host the summit.
His Majesty is delighted
there will be no war.
As we all are.
About the other matter we discussed.
Which other matter, Your Eminence?
I saved your master's arse.
Now I want my reward...
...and you can arrange it.
Do you understand?
Poor you.
Now, where were we
when we were so rudely interrupted?
Charles.
We shouldn't.
My father will kill you.
Then I shall die a happy man.
Now,
have you all finished your reading?
- Yes, Father.
- Yes, Father.
Yes.
Very well.
May God and his angels bless you
and keep you this night and always.
Good night.
Good night, children.
Stop.
The letter to King Francis,
Your Majesty?
My dearest royal cousin...
No.
Make that my beloved cousin.
We send you our love.
We love you so much it would be
impossible to love you better.
Make all the necessary arrangements
so we may meet face to face.
Nothing is now closer
or more dear to my heart...
...than this treaty of universal peace.
As a token of my goodwill...
...my commitment to this treaty
and my love for Your Majesty...
...I have decided...
I have decided...
Yes, Your Majesty?
I've decided I will not shave again
until we meet.
My beard will be a token
of universal friendship...
...of the love between us.
- Your Eminence.
- Your Grace.
I have some news for Your Eminence.
His Holiness, Pope Alexander,
is desperately ill.
It cannot be long
before he is summoned to God's house.
In view of Your Eminence's
well-known piety...
...as well as your great learning
and diplomatic skills...
...I can assure Your Eminence...
...of the support of the French
cardinals at the conclave...
...to elect a successor.
With the votes of your own cardinals...
...and if it is pleasing to God...
...you will be elected pope.
Bishop of Rome.
Our new Holy Father.
Thank you, Your Grace.
You make me feel truly humble.
- Are you ill, Lady Blount?
- No, Your Majesty.
Please stay.
Thank you. Good night.
I have not talked to anyone
for a long time.
Cardinal Wolsey
dismissed my Spanish confessor...
...and most of my Spanish ladies,
in case they were spies.
And I cannot
trust my English confessor.
But I can trust you though.
Can I not, Lady Blount?
Yes, madam.
What is my sadness?
It is that I...
I cannot give the king a living son.
I gave birth to a baby boy once.
Sweet boy.
But he died in my arms...
...after just four weeks of life.
The king blames me, I know it.
He thinks it all my fault.
He does not know how much I suffer,
how much I pray.
I've been thinking about my brother.
Arthur.
When he died, it was decided
that I should marry Catherine.
I think my father
didn't want to lose her dowry...
...or the prestige
of a Spanish marriage.
In any case...
...Catherine swore
the marriage was never consummated.
That's why a papal dispensation
was granted.
And so I married her.
And since then,
we have had five stillborn children.
A boy...
...who lived for 26 days.
And a single living daughter.
What if their marriage
was consummated?
She has sworn before God
that it was not.
What does it say in the Gospels?
If a man should marry
his brother's wife.
Tell me.
In Leviticus it says:
"If a man
marries his brother's wife...
...they will die childless."
But you have a child.
But not a son.
I have no son.
Sir Thomas Boleyn, Your Grace.
Sir Thomas. I hope you didn't find
my invitation presumptuous.
I heard you've been
recalled from France.
I'm here for a short while,
Your Grace.
Come.
They tell me
you're an excellent ambassador.
Then, whoever they are,
they are very kind.
You come from an old family.
Though not as ancient,
nor as grand as Your Grace's.
The king chooses
to surround himself with commoners.
Men of no distinction.
New men without pedigree.
How does that help
the prestige of his crown?
- Your Grace...
- His father only acquired the crown...
...by force, not by right.
Your Grace...
...no one wants to return
to the evil days of civil war.
What is done is done.
The king is the king.
The king is the king.
Wolsey.
A man of the cloth
with a mistress and two children.
How do you like this fellow?
Not at all.
We shall talk again.
Tell me about King Francis,
Sir Thomas.
He's 23 years old.
Is he tall?
Yes.
But ill-proportioned.
What about his legs?
Are his calves strong, like mine?
Your Majesty,
no one has calves like yours.
Is he handsome?
Some people might think so.
- He certainly thinks so himself.
- He's vain?
Your Majesty, he's French.
What about his court?
It has a reputation for loose morals
and licentiousness...
...which the king, by his own
behaviour, does nothing to dispel.
You have two daughters, Sir Thomas.
How do you protect them?
I keep a watchful eye on them.
But I also trust in their goodness
and virtue.
You will return immediately to Paris.
I'm entrusting you with all the
diplomatic negotiations for the summit.
Checkmate.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
Mary.
Papa.
Aren't you beautiful?
The most beautiful girl in the world?
- I don't know.
- Yes, you are. How do you feel?
- Well.
- Well?
Papa's busy.
Be good.
And do everything you're told.
May we speak?
Continue.
My Lady.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- I do not like it.
- What don't you like?
Your beard.
- Nor what it represents.
- Catherine.
You are giving my daughter away
to the dauphin and to France.
You did not even consult me.
The Valois are the sworn enemies
of my family.
She is mine to do with, as I see fit.
It's a great marriage.
I see Wolsey's hand behind this.
Though I love Your Majesty...
...and am loyal to you in every way...
...I cannot disguise my distress
and unhappiness.
Well, you're going to have to.
Where are my daughters?
I have some exciting news.
There is to be a summit...
...between King Francis and King Henry
near Calais. I am to arrange it.
That means you'll have the opportunity
to meet the king of England.
Mary...
...and Anne Boleyn. To your futures.
His Eminence Cardinal Wolsey.
I want your opinion.
Do you like this cloth?
I think it suits Your Majesty
very well.
Perhaps, if I might suggest...
...with these.
Do you think Francis
will have anything as fine as these?
Only if he steals them.
Come.
Let's eat together. We can talk.
Hold.
Your Grace will apologise.
I said, you will apologise.
I apologise if I have offended,
Your Majesty.
Your Grace may leave us.
Boy, fetch the chancellor
a new pair of shoes.
Hopkins.
Hopkins.
Your Grace.
It's time.
Speak to me.
Yes, well,
everything is prepared for the summit.
It will take place in the Pale of Calais.
English territory.
In a valley known as the Val d'Or.
The valley of gold.
A thousand labourers have constructed
a palace for Your Majesty.
It's known as the palace of illusion.
Some say
it's the eighth wonder of the world.
Purchase cloth of gold and silver. It's
a better thing to bribe the guards with.
Yes, Your Grace.
Then proceed to our estates
and do as we discussed.
Just making noise that we're
only raising men to defend ourselves.
Yes, your Grace.
Lady Blount is with child.
Lady Blount.
If you want to keep the child,
I will arrange for her...
...to be moved to the house in Jericho.
I will also deal with her husband.
My father once told me how he'd
planned to assassinate Richard III.
He would come before him
with a knife secreted about his person.
Your Majesty.
I can't wait for this summit.
It will change the world forever.
That is my dearest hope,
and my ultimate belief.
Nothing will ever be the same,
Your Eminence.
You and I will be immortal.
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.
- Halt.
- Halt!
There it is.
Val D'Or.
The Valley of Gold.
- What if the French don't show?
- Oh, they'll show.
They'll just be fashionably late.
Your Majesty, look. There they are.
What's the plan?
I was to ride down alone
and meet the king.
It's a trap. What if they mean
to lure you down to kill you?
All of you. On pain of death.
Stay.
Come on.
The king.
What is thou doing?
- Cousin.
- Cousin.
After you.
After you.
- How do you like my beard?
- You almost look French, you know?
Hear ye. Hear ye.
"I, Henry, by the grace of God
King of England...
...lreland and France, do hereby..."
Stop.
I cannot be that while you are here,
for I would be a liar.
During this summit,
I am simply Henry, King of England.
And I am just Francois.
King of France and Burgundy.
Majesties, may I ask you each
to place a hand upon the Holy Bible...
...and swear before God and these
princes and lords here gathered...
...that you will be true, virtuous,
and loving to each other.
I so swear.
I swear too. Of course.
Princess Mary.
May I introduce Prince Henry Philip,
your future husband?
Are you the Dauphin of France?
Then I want to kiss you.
Mary.
I have got to get one of these.
Palace of Illusions.
What do you think?
It's incredible, Your Majesty.
It's only painted canvas.
- But real wine.
- Don't drink too much of it, Charles.
Your Majesty.
And now I have a gift for you.
- You embarrass me, brother.
- Oh, no.
And all I can give you in return
is this pastry.
What are you thinking, Charles?
I'm thinking that, while I'm here I
should behave like the King of France.
Which means?
Which means I shall slip readily
into the gardens of others...
...and drink water
from many fountains, eh?
Do you see
that young woman over there?
Dressed in purple and gold?
Yes.
Her name is Mary Boleyn,
the daughter of the ambassador...
...with her sister Anne.
I call Mary my English mare
because I ride her so often.
Gentlemen.
Thomas.
Papa.
King Henry noticed you today.
He wants to see you.
Wait.
I must go and tell Anne.
Anne.
What's your name, boy?
Thomas Tallis, Your Majesty.
Tallis. Good voice.
- Take a sovereign for your song.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Boleyn.
- What of Buckingham?
In my presence,
he has railed against your eminence.
Calling you a necromancer, a pimp.
Accusing you of using evil ways
to maintain your hold over the king.
And what did Lord Buckingham say
about the king?
He told me
he has a greater claim to the throne.
And that as His Majesty
has no male heirs, and will have none...
...that he, Buckingham,
will succeed to the throne.
But he also told me
that he has considered...
...bringing that eventuality
forward more quickly.
- In what way?
- By assassinating His Majesty.
You did well to come to me.
But I must warn you,
say nothing of this to anyone.
You see that, brother?
In most things, we French excel you.
We have the greatest painters...
...the greatest musicians
and the greatest poets.
Most of whom, by the way,
live at my court de ma cie.
The greatest philosophical minds,
engineers, architects.
And of course,
we have the most beautiful women.
You won't deny that, will you?
Even our wrestlers
are better than yours.
- Are you sure?
- What?
I said are you sure
all your wrestlers are better than mine?
Do you wanna prove it?
What are you suggesting?
I am challenging you
to a wrestling match, brother.
No.
You're a coward.
The French honour is at stake.
I accept your challenge.
- Let's do it now.
- Groom.
- Your Majesty...
- No.
Majesties, gentlemen.
The rules are as follows:
First man to throw his opponent to the
ground shall be declared the winner.
- Are you content?
- Yes.
Then fight on.
- What bet will you lay?
- Come on, Henry.
- Two kings, two queens and a fool.
- Who's the fool?
I don't know yet, but it's a full house.
Come on, Your Majesty.
Henry's gonna win.
Whatever happens,
he's not gonna win.
- Come on, Henry.
- Come on, Henry, you got him.
Come on. Come on.
- Come on, monsieur.
- Yes.
I want a rematch. I want a rematch.
Are you afraid?
Are you afraid of a rematch?
Are you calling me afraid?
Of what am I supposed to be afraid?
- Of me!
- Let's have it then.
I'm not gonna sign this treaty.
I'm not gonna sign it, go and tell them.
- Lf that's what you...
- Go and tell them.
All right.
If you want the world to know...
...that the king is changeable, shallow,
intemperate...
...incapable of keeping his word,
then, of course, I will go and tell them.
After all, I am merely
Your Majesty's humble servant.
- Lady Mary.
- Your Majesty.
I have heard a lot about you.
You've been at the French court
for two years.
Tell me.
What French graces
have you learned?
- With Your Majesty's permission?
- Granted.
And now I ask his gracious Majesty,
the King of England...
...to also sign in good faith, the Treaty
of Universal and Perpetual Peace.
Leave.
Forget about the French,
the Queen's nephew has been elected.
Now he is not only Charles V,
the King of Spain,
...he's also the Holy Roman Emperor.
His dominions are vast,
his wealth extraordinary.
And he's only 20 years old.
You will make arrangements
to visit him at Aachen. Personally.
It may suit us better to do business
with him than with the French.
Yes, Majesty.
Sir Thomas Boleyn, Your Grace.
Your Grace...
What did you think
of that performance?
- L...
- Don't be stupid, you're not.
The king's performance at the summit.
How did it strike you?
Personally, I would have wished
to have seen a greater...
...more powerful man
upon the throne of England.
Someone whose presence...
...would have made the French
sit up and come to heel.
I have the way and the means
to crush the usurper of my throne...
...as one would crush
a revolting spider.
I will make him wish
he'd entered the Church after all...
...and left the affairs of the state
to those who are born to rule.
You betray me, Boleyn,
I'll feed your body to me dogs.
Now,
what have you discovered here?
I have it on good authority...
...that the Duke of Buckingham
is raising an army.
He says it's to protect him
while he tours his Welsh estates...
...where he's not popular.
He's also been borrowing
large sums of money.
Buckingham?
Invite him to court for the New Year.
But don't say anything to alarm him.
How are your children?
They're well, thank you,
Your Majesty.
I encourage them all at their studies.
Even the girls.
Always the idealist.
At some point, I imagine,
it will be considered ordinary enough...
...and nothing strange
for a girl to be educated.
I've received a gift
from the Duke of Urbino.
It's a book called The Prince,
by a Florentine, Niccolo Machiavelli.
Yes, I know it.
It's about political opportunism.
It's true.
It's not like your book Utopia.
It's less utopian.
Nevertheless,
he asks an important question:
Whether it is better for a king
to be feared or loved.
Buckingham is going to try and kill me.
- Your Eminence.
- Lady Blount.
- You are full term?
- In a little while.
- Are you well?
- As can be expected.
Have you some message
from His Majesty?
No, none. But from your husband.
My husband.
Yes, I have spoken to him.
He finds that he has reconciled
to your condition.
Then he won't send me to a nunnery?
He will be made an earl,
and given estates.
And my child?
That is for the king to decide
whether he will recognise the child.
I'm afraid I can offer you
no more comfort than that.
Will you tell the king
of my love for him?
My lord, I hereby pledge my allegiance
to you and your house.
And do swear to serve you,
even unto death.
We thank you
from the bottom of our heart.
And in due course, you will find your
loyalties richly and properly rewarded.
I thought I should tell you.
I'm being sent to meet
the new Holy Roman Emperor.
The king has asked me to draw up
a new treaty...
...uniting us against the French.
- You must be very disappointed.
- I am very realistic.
Then I am disappointed.
- Our dreams were very unrealistic.
- Maybe so.
But I will continue to dream them,
even if I am alone in doing so.
I fear His Majesty no longer
trusts or cares for me as he once did.
Thomas,
let me give you a little advice.
If you want to keep the love of a prince,
this is what you must do.
You must be prepared to give him the
thing you most care for in all the world.
The thing I care for most
is my integrity.
What is it you care for most
in the world, Your Eminence?
His Grace, the Duke of Norfolk.
Your Grace.
I hope Your Majesty will accept
this humble gift for the New Year.
We are very grateful to Your Grace.
Your generosity overwhelms me.
As always.
Lie down.
- Get some linens.
- His Grace, the Duke of Buckingham.
Your Grace.
Your Majesty.
- It has some words engraved on it.
- Give it to me.
"With humble, true hearts."
Your Grace overwhelms me.
Your words touch me.
They are the greatest gift.
Greater than any riches.
Push, my Lady. Push.
Breathe. It's coming.
With true and humble heart.
There.
Hold, Your Grace.
What do you want?
Your Grace is arrested
on suspicion of treason.
I'm ordered by the king's majesty
to take you to the Tower.
You take my advice, gentlemen,
you let us pass.
By no means.
And if any of your men should strike...
...against His Majesty's servants
in pursuit of their duties...
...that's treason too.
As Your Grace should know.
Your Grace.
You. You are only new men.
You don't know anything.
If I am accused of treason...
...I should be judged by a jury of my
peers, not by the dogs of butchers.
There's no lord in England
who will ever find against me.
Form them up.
I have instituted a Court of High
Steward to judge Buckingham's case.
Twenty peers will be appointed
to the court.
Norfolk will be first among them.
- Your Majesty, if I may?
- What?
I believe it could be dangerous
to find the duke guilty of treason.
- Even if he is?
- Even if he is.
On the other hand, he could be
found guilty of some lesser offence.
Heavily fined and banished from court.
In that way, he would be disgraced,
but his friends and allies...
...would have little cause or occasion
to rise against you.
- And that would be the best outcome?
- I believe it would, yes.
And you would see to it
that the court come to that decision?
I have every confidence.
As I have in Your Eminence.
Wolsey will set up the court.
Norfolk will head it.
I want you to remind His Grace
of his responsibilities.
14-30.
Chase to four, gentlemen.
Ball.
Mary?
Does the king
still call for you at night?
No, Papa.
Even though the king is your godfather,
when you approach him...
Your Grace.
What do you want?
Only to pass on His Majesty's love.
He appreciates the role you will play
at my Lord Buckingham's trial...
...and for all the care you have
for His Majesty's well-being.
He also sends you this.
This is my father's ring.
He was executed by His Majesty's
father, did you know that?
His Majesty thought
you might like to wear it.
- Is this your son?
- Yes, it is.
And he's going to be received
by his godfather, the king.
Your Grace should have a care
for his inheritance.
It would be terrible
if some action of yours...
...were to deprive him of a father,
a title and a ring.
Your Grace.
Your Grace
has been accused of treason...
...and of imagining and plotting
the death of the king's majesty.
This court of High Steward...
...after reviewing all the evidence
against Your Grace...
...finds Your Grace
guilty of the charges against you.
No.
And so sentences Your Grace to death
at His Majesty's pleasure.
This is your doing.
Butcher's dog.
It's all your doing!
Bastards!
Your Majesty.
God bless you, sir.
Take this, Your Grace.
Traitor.
Do you forgive me?
Your Grace must lie down.
When you stretch out your arms,
I will strike.
Stretch out your arms.
I have a son. I have a son.
Thank God.
Thank God.
Come on, you charlatan.
I have a son!
I have a son, God.
Can you hear me? I have a son.
Your Majesty is to be congratulated
on such a happy event.
Thank you, Your Eminence.
The Lady is upstairs.
- Henry, congratulations.
- Thank you, Charles.
- I always knew it wasn't my fault.
- No.
His Majesty
has decided to recognise his son.
He will be known for the present
as Henry Fitzroy.
And he will have his own establishment
at Durham House...
...with a chaplain, officer
and a retinue befitting his station.
Thank you.
You should write
and thank His Majesty.
I only do his bidding.
The queen. The queen.
To my son.
What was your deal with Wolsey?
In return for England
not going to war with France...
...I promised him the French vote.
The fact is, Wolsey has gone to Aachen
to meet the new emperor.
He obviously means to break the treaty
with your king.
In which case...
...we are no longer obliged
to deliver our side of the bargain.
In any case,
we don't want an English Pope.
We had one once.
He was insane. Never again.
The Pope must be an Italian.
That is God's will.
- Your Holiness must swallow it.
- Push it.
My Lady, full of grace, I pray you,
I beseech you in all humility...
...for the love I bear for you,
and for your son, Jesus Christ.
I pray you give me a child.
A son to fill my empty womb.
I beg you.
In a few weeks, the court
will quit Whitehall for Hampton Court.
There's been an incident
of Sweating Sickness in the city.
You know how afraid the king is
of any illness.
How is the king?
I was sorry to hear
of Cardinal Orsini's election as Pope.
You are perpetually sorry, More.
- I wasn't simply being polite.
- Oh, really?
I was not.
As long as there is such corruption
in the Church...
...that heretic Luther
will continue to gain followers.
I know that if you had been elected
he would have worked tirelessly...
...to cleanse the Church
of all its evil practises.
Perhaps you think too highly of me,
Thomas.
Perhaps, you think too highly
of the whole human race.
- Lady Blount.
- Mr. More.
The queen.
My lady.
The queen.
- Uncle.
- Anne.
- Sweet Anne.
- Yes, Papa.
- You know why you're here?
- No, Papa.
- In Paris no one explained.
- Good, it's better that way.
What's happened?
His Majesty is tiring
of his French alliance.
It seems he's also tiring of your sister.
He no longer invites her to his bed.
- Poor Mary.
- Poor us.
When she was his mistress,
all our fortunes were made.
Now most likely they will fall.
Unless...
Even if he had me,
who is to say he would keep me?
It's not just Mary. They say
that all his liaisons are soon over.
He blows hot, he blows cold.
Perhaps you could imagine a way
to keep his interest more...
...prolonged?
I daresay
you learned things in France.
How to play his passions?
There's something
deep and dangerous in you, Anne.
Those eyes of yours
are like dark hooks for the soul.
How was your meeting
with the emperor?
Good. Productive.
He makes no secret
of his antipathy for the French.
He wants to go to war with them...
...and he's desperate
for an alliance with Your Majesty.
And in return for our alliance?
There will be a joint invasion of France
for the overthrow of King Francis.
And I shall claim the crown.
And once more truly be King
of England, Ireland and France.
Just like my forefathers.
Your Eminence has built
the most beautiful palace here.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Probably the finest house in England.
I have nothing to compare with it.
Nothing to show more fair.
Your Majesty...
...it is yours.
With the furnishings?
Come on.
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.
Let's rehearse again, everybody.
Shut the gate. Concentrate please.
Ready, everybody?
Attack!
Well, go on! Attack!
That's enough, everybody.
Stop, you idiots.
Stop!
Have you any idea
of the cost of this production?
Do you truly imagine
His Majesty will be happy...
...to spend a small fortune
on such a large shambles?
Who fired that musket ball?
I think I did, Mr. Cornish, sir.
What are you trying to do?
If you can't entertain the envoys, then
you're going to shoot them instead?
Is that it?
Again.
I have some business
for you, Charles.
As you desire.
My sister Margaret is to marry
the king of Portugal.
I want you to escort her
and her dowry to Lisbon...
...and give her away in my name.
Why me?
I need someone I can trust.
You trust me with a beautiful woman?
With my sister, of course I trust you.
Why shouldn't I?
In any case,
you're already betrothed to?
What's her name? I can't keep up.
Elizabeth Grey.
She's a cousin
of the marquess of Dorset.
Exactly.
I'm honoured by Your Majesty's trust,
but there's still a difficulty.
I'm not important enough
to give away the sister of a king...
...let alone the king of England.
That's why I'm making you a duke.
Duke of Suffolk.
How does that please your grace?
Come on!
The emperor
sends his best wishes to the king.
We are most grateful to you, Mr. More,
for coming to welcome us in person.
No, it's my honour.
His Majesty regards your visit
as a thing of great moment.
When shall we have
an audience with His Majesty?
Let me advise
Your Excellencies on this...
...there's only one way
to reach the king's ear...
...and that is through the good offices
of Cardinal Wolsey.
We heard some rumours, Mr. More...
...that the cardinal
advocates French interests.
Only when he considers them
to be in ours.
Tell me,
what is the emperor's attitude...
...to the rise of the Lutheran heresy
in some of his territories?
My friend Erasmus tells me
that in Germany...
...it's spreading like a forest fire.
His Highness does everything
in his power to suppress it.
But, as you know,
Luther himself is the guest...
...of one of the German princes
unfortunately beyond his control.
My king is writing a pamphlet
demolishing Luther's arguments...
...defending the papacy and our faith.
You mean, he is writing it himself,
with his own hand?
No.
There are a great many things
that my king can do.
The envoys from the emperor,
Your Eminence.
Your Excellencies.
This is indeed a happy day.
We have planned many festivities
in honour of this most welcome visit.
And it is my devout hope and wish...
...that together we can finalize
the details of a treaty...
...which will bind your master
and mine in perpetual friendship.
That is very much our hope too,
Your Eminence.
Good, please.
Not you, Thomas.
I don't want to waste
your time or mine.
So before we drink, tell me...
...is the emperor
in fact sincere about this treaty?
- Of course he is.
- Good.
Then I propose to cement it...
...we also announce
the betrothal of the emperor...
...to the daughter of the king,
Princess Mary.
It is our understanding that she
is already betrothed to the dauphin.
But now,
she will be betrothed to Charles.
Unless you have
some other objection?
On the contrary.
Good. Then we are agreed.
The Emperor told us
to inform Your Eminence personally...
...that he wishes to bestow upon you
a very generous pension.
He will also throw his weight
behind your ambitions to be Pope.
Let us drink to the success
of Your Excellencies' visit.
By all means.
You have found means
to put my niece before the king?
Yes, Your Grace. It's already arranged.
Anne is to appear in the pageant
for the Spanish envoys. As is the king.
She will find a way
to draw his attention.
Good.
Once she opens her legs for him...
...she can open her mouth
and denounce Wolsey.
They do say that the sharpest blades
are sheathed in the softest pouches.
His Eminence, Cardinal Wolsey...
...and the Spanish ambassadors,
Mendoza and Chapuys.
Who are those ladies?
They are the graces, Excellence.
They have names like Kindness,
Honour, Constancy, Mercy and Pity.
They are prisoners in the castle.
The figure to the left
under the broken hearts...
...is His Majesty's sister,
Princess Margaret.
Who is keeping them prisoner?
Danger, Jealousy, Unkindness, Scorn,
Disdain, Strangeness, et cetera.
Is the king there?
Which one is the king?
The men represent Youth, Devotion,
Loyalty, Pleasure, Gentleness, Liberty.
And, yes,
His Majesty is hid amongst them.
As Ardent Desire,
I demand you release your prisoners.
As Lady Scorn,
I laugh at your desires.
These men are noble lords.
No, they're just men dressed up.
I say it again, release these fair
damsels that you keep so cruelly.
Never.
Then you give us no choice but
to attack and breach your defences.
No knight shall ever breach mine.
Lady, Desire overcomes all.
Attack!
Perseverance,
you are my prisoner now.
- Sister.
- Brother.
And now all shall be unmasked.
I must speak to you.
I trust you have settled
all your affairs here, Margaret?
Yes, but...
The king has written
of his love for you...
...and his eagerness to set eyes
on you, having seen your portrait.
I plead with you, as your sister,
don't make me marry him.
He's an old man.
And who are you?
I'm Anne Boleyn.
Thank you, Master Cornish.
I'm very grateful to you.
Sir Thomas.
May I see your mistress?
A gentleman, my lady.
Mr. Brandon.
You are not yet invested
a duke, I think.
Aye, madam.
I shall be taking with me to Portugal,
a company of 200 persons.
They shall include my chamberlain,
my chaplain, my laundress...
...all of my ladies.
Yes, madam.
Should you have anything to discuss,
you may do so with my chamberlain.
Yes, madam.
I'm surprised my brother chose a man
without noble blood to represent him.
Even Norfolk would have been better.
The queen is ready.
I will announce you to the queen.
Her Majesty, Catherine of Aragon,
Queen of England.
Your Majesty,
the envoys from Spain.
I know you have an audience
with the king.
I just couldn't let you pass
without seeing you.
Majesty...
...your nephew the emperor
sends you his love and filial regards.
Always.
Tell him, if he loves me...
...he should write to me more often.
But I am happy from the bottom
of my heart...
...that you are here...
...and that there is going to be a treaty.
Just beware the cardinal.
His Majesty will receive you now.
Gentlemen, welcome to my kingdom.
I know you will succeed in your efforts
to negotiate a successful treaty.
You may trust everything
Cardinal Wolsey says.
He speaks for me directly
in all matters.
As for my part, I should like to invite
the emperor to visit here...
...as soon as can be arranged.
The visit would give pleasure
both to me and to my queen.
Your Majesty.
- When's he coming?
- At the end of this month.
So soon?
If he needs allies for his attack on
the French, he intends to do so shortly.
Indeed. The envoys told me
in confidence...
...that the emperor will strike first
against the French occupation in Italy.
He has a claim to the duchy of Milan.
And then?
Then having driven them out of Italy
with your help...
...he will invade France itself.
I want you to prepare
all our forces for a joint invasion.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- And I want another warship.
Your Majesty, we have
only just launched the Victory.
Then order another one.
A greater one.
What we lack in men,
we can more than make up for in ships.
We're an island race, cardinal.
We have the best
and bravest sailors in the world.
- I will have the greatest navy.
- Ships are expensive.
My father was a careful man.
A shrewd man. A business man.
He left me a great deal
of money, Your Eminence.
I intend to spend it.
Good.
Sir Thomas Boleyn.
Sir Thomas.
Majesty.
Come. I feel I've been a little remiss.
I never showed my gratitude to you
for the diplomatic efforts you made.
Your Majesty had no need.
I'm simply content to serve you
in whatever capacity I can be of use.
Nevertheless,
I wish to show my gratitude.
It pleases me to make you
a knight of the Garter.
I'm also appointing you
comptroller of my household.
I believe Your Majesty...
...has a greater opinion
of my talents than I have.
I shall be the judge of that.
We shall talk more later.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Your daughter.
The one who performed
in our masquerade.
- Anne.
- Yes.
As a matter of fact,
she's soon to come to court...
...as a lady in waiting to Her Majesty.
And will you leave me thus?
Say nay, say nay, for shame
To save you from the blame
Of all my grief and grame
And will you leave me so?
Say no, say no
And will you leave me thus?
And have no more pity
Of he that loves thee?
Alas, your cruelty!
And will you leave me thus?
Say no, say no
Well, do you like it?
Should I like something
that accuses me of being cruel?
- You are cruel, Mistress Anne.
- Am I?
You have no claim on me,
Master Wyatt.
I have the same claim
as every other lover...
...to whom a woman's heart
has been freely given.
You are a poet, as I am a woman.
Poets and women are always free
with their hearts, are they not?
Anne...
Stop it, Tom. You mustn't.
Then I was right.
You are leaving me.
- Why don't you answer me?
- You're married.
Yes. But I'm separated.
I'm going to divorce.
I mean, who isn't married?
You must never ask to see me again.
Do you promise?
Why should I?
When I have just learned
what promises are worth.
Is it another? Is that it?
Do you love another?
Never ask of me...
...and never, if you value your life,
speak of me to others.
Do you understand?
Have you no pity?
Can you imagine? Lmagine
what he's gonna be like now.
I'll wager he's already ordered
a bigger codpiece.
Yes, Your Grace. No, Your Grace.
Let me bottle up your farts
and sell them for nectar, Your Grace.
I don't wanna think about it any more.
It makes me ill.
So, what shall we do?
Find women.
Even if she was a complete Venus...
...I couldn't satisfy her
in my dejected state.
- Let's just drink more, then.
- All right.
Here. To His Grace.
- Here's to Charles.
- His Grace.
Did the envoys leave in good cheer?
They were in excellent spirits.
The treaty is agreed.
And my nephew will come?
We wait for news.
Wolsey will find out.
I had a dream.
In my dream, you came to me again
and held me in your arms...
...and you whispered
that all would be well.
And all manner of things
would be well.
Henry.
Sweetheart. Husband.
You must believe me.
I never knew your brother in that way.
He was so young. And he was ill.
I have never known another man,
nor ever want to.
I love you.
The king.
The king would like you
to come to his chambers.
Mary.
My darling daughter.
- Have you said your prayers?
- Yes.
My Lord...
...how like you this?
Has the king sent any message
or sign that he might visit me tonight?
- No, my lady.
- No.
I'm worried about you, my love.
You work too hard.
I know that.
It will kill you.
I know that too.
What am I supposed to do?
Stay alive.
- Aren't you coming?
- What's happening?
The queen's new ladies have arrived.
Come on.
- Beautiful hair, mistress.
- Things are looking up.
Mistress. Mistress.
The way she carries herself.
"What serpent was ever so venomous...
...as to call the holy city of Rome
'Babylon'...
...and the Pope's authority 'Tyranny'...
...and turn the name
of our Holy Father into 'Anti-Christ'?"
It's very good.
- Strongly worded, but it's very good.
- You're sure?
Well, you might think of toning down
the polemic, just a little.
For example, where
you describe Luther as this weed.
Where is it?
Here, "This dilapidated,
sick and evil-minded sheep."
Tone it down?
Well, yes, for diplomatic purposes.
No, never.
No language can be strong enough
to condemn Luther...
...nor gracious enough
to praise His Holiness.
I will dedicate a copy to him
and you will take it to him in Rome.
Why me?
If there is anything true and good in it,
it is due to you.
I could never have written it,
or anything else, Sir Thomas More...
...without your guidance
and unfailing honesty.
Why did you call me Sir Thomas?
A knighthood is the least I could do.
It's a great deal more than I deserve.
Now, don't be too modest, Thomas.
You're not a saint.
There is something else
I want you to do for me.
Seize all the copies
of Luther's works you can find...
...and burn them.
Burn them all.
From France.
Well, King Francis
has already discovered...
...our rapprochement
with the emperor.
He feels betrayed and angry...
...and is making threats
against our interests.
Who told him?
My lords and ladies,
His lmperial Highness...
...Charles, Holy Roman Emperor,
King of Aragon, Valencia, Naples...
...and Sicily,
Duke of the Burgundian Territories...
...Archduke of Austria.
Your Eminence, a moment.
Move away, Mr. Pace. Move away.
Yes, Eminence.
Your Highness.
Your Majesty.
I did not expect...
I could not sustain the anticipation.
I had to come straight down
and welcome you myself.
Then I am truly honoured.
Tonight, we shall dance and feast.
And tomorrow,
you shall come see my ships.
Gentlemen. Music. Let's celebrate.
Come.
Remove that man.
Wait. No, wait. Wait.
Mr. Pace.
You knew, of course...
...that His Majesty was going to make
this surprise visit, did you not?
Well, yes. As his secretary,
I would obviously know.
Yes, of course, you did.
And you also knew, of course...
...that the imperial envoys
had come privately...
...to make a treaty with His Majesty.
But then, of course,
you speak Spanish, don't you?
Almost as well as you speak French.
L... I don't understand, Your Eminence.
I think you do, Mr. Pace.
I really think you do.
Because you see,
I think you not only spy for me...
...you also spy for the French.
No. It's not true.
You are removed
from all your positions.
No, wait, wait, wait.
I swear to you.
I swear by everything
that's holy, it's not true.
His Majesty is held dear in my heart.
It is treason
to plot against His Majesty.
Wait. What are you saying?
Wait, Your Eminence, please.
Don't do this.
You know it's not true,
Your Eminence, please.
I beg you.
You know it's not true, Your Eminence.
Please! Please!
This is my flagship, The Mary Rose.
She's the largest warship afloat.
She displaces 700 tons,
fires 91 guns...
...and has a company of 400 men.
I have nothing like this.
You have vast armies.
Together, we shall be invincible.
How could the French withstand us?
With you beside me,
there is no boundary...
...or frontier
or world we could not conquer.
I like you already.
Except for the chin,
what is there not to like?
Prisoner to the steps.
You must believe me,
I'm an innocent man.
I don't know why
I have been brought here.
I'm innocent!
No, no, no.
I've done nothing wrong.
I've done nothing wrong!
You know, you and I are united
by an indissoluble tie.
Since you married my mother's sister,
you are really my uncle.
It's an affinity which both delights
and pleases me, nephew.
Your Highness, your aunt awaits.
Your Majesty, His lmperial Highness,
Charles, Holy Roman Emperor.
Majesty, I ask for your blessing,
as a nephew to an aunt.
I give you my blessing freely,
my dear Charles...
...as I give you my love.
Your Highness...
...allow me to present
my daughter Mary, your future bride.
Bravo! Come.
Now, we must wait
to be married.
Do you think you have the patience?
I have a present for Your Highness.
Do you want to see it?
I love presents. Show me.
There. Look.
- Are they for me?
- Do you like them?
They're the best presents I've ever had.
Thank you, Your Highness.
As soon as possible,
you must both come and visit me.
I want to show you especially
the treasures of Montezuma...
...the king of the Aztecs,
that General Cortes...
...recently discovered in Mexico.
- We should love that.
- Yes.
We've heard a little
about the lands across the sea...
...they call the Indies.
I tell you, I swear to you,
that is where the future lies.
So much undiscovered land.
So much wealth of gold and silver...
...of minerals and salts.
Madam.
Sweetheart.
Put yourself in his way.
How are your preparations going?
We are recruiting
more German mercenaries.
But everything is going well.
- I shall take Milan by next spring.
- And then?
And then, together,
we shall invade France...
...and bring to an end the adventures
of that libertine monarch...
...King Francis.
That will make me very happy.
It will also make you king of France.
Yes.
Will you dance, Your Highness?
With Your Majesty's permission.
Granted.
Excuse me.
The king of Portugal,
I've heard he also has gout.
They say his spine is deformed.
He walks like a crab.
Promise me something, brother.
I'll agree to marry him
on one condition.
When he's dead, which can't be long,
I can marry whom I choose.
Agreed?
Not drinking today, Charles,
or should I say, Your Grace?
You should definitely call him
by his real name...
...which is cunt or villain.
- Why?
- We're supposed to be friends, Charles.
- Aren't we still?
- Not if you don't show us favour.
It's within your gift to ask His Majesty
to give us some titles...
...or at least some land.
It seems that everything the king has
to give, he's given to you.
- Jealous?
- Naturally.
As you rise, so too should we.
So, what can we do for you,
Your Grace?
Show me some respect.
I am so glad to see you.
It is often lonely here.
Lonely?
Things are not well between us,
His Majesty and I.
But I saw with my own eyes
how attentive he is to you.
He looks at you with such devotion...
...it seems, with such love.
I fear that is for your benefit.
Henry is a good masker.
I don't wanna hear this again.
Lady Anne.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I think sometimes
he will ask me for a divorce.
A divorce?
No. That's impossible.
Is it?
Forgive me.
Anne.
No. Not like this.
- How?
- Seduce me.
Write letters to me.
And poems. I love poems.
Ravish me with your words.
Seduce me.
Majesty?
It's all right.
She's gone.
For Your Majesties to sign...
...between you this treaty
of perpetual amity and concord...
...and to confirm with your seals
and before these witnesses...
...the betrothal of Charles,
Holy Roman Emperor...
...and her Highness, Princess Mary,
upon her reaching the age of 12.
I say to you again...
...in my power as papal legate
and Chancellor of England...
...that you should sign this treaty
of friendship, one to another...
...and never break it,
so help you God.
I swear to you
my honour and allegiance.
You must always trust in me.
Always.
Where is Mr. Pace?
He should have been here.
Your Majesty,
I have discovered, shamefully...
...that Mr. Pace was not deserving
of Your Majesty's trust.
I have removed him from his offices.
You're sure?
The French were paying him
a pension.
I see. I trust you will find me
a replacement.
Well, how do our affairs proceed?
Very well, Your Grace.
The king makes
no obvious declaration of interest.
But it's possible to detect it
in the way he glances at her...
...as if, in his mind,
he could see her naked.
Yes, well, he looks
at most young women that way.
But it is a start.
A beginning at least to the end
of that insufferable prelate.
All in good time.
One thing will follow another.
Perhaps it would be a good idea...
...to include
the Duke of Suffolk in our plans.
Charles Brandon?
He is barely a gentleman.
He's the king's closest friend.
And I believe hates Wolsey
as much as we do.
He would be a natural ally,
at least for a time.
Attack!
Two points for Mr. Anthony Knivert.
Mr. Heys, do you have those pieces
I asked for?
Yes, Your Majesty.
One, rubies set in circlets of gold.
A second, a precious stone
upon a bed of gold and pearl.
Third, small and large drops of pearl,
with gold and purple...
...and the detail of a lion's head.
And lastly, feathers of silver,
gold and amber.
Jewels fit for a queen, Your Majesty.
It was Wolsey! It was Wolsey!
Not me! Listen to me!
It's Wolsey
who has a pension from the French.
It's not me. Listen to me.
I didn't do anything. I'm innocent.
It was Wolsey. Wolsey. Wolsey.
Just ask him! Ask him!
It was Wolsey!
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.
His Majesty, the king.
My dear sister.
Fare you well on your journey.
Remember, the king of Portugal,
your future husband...
...loves and respects you.
And you must love him in return.
Remember your promise.
When he dies,
I marry whom I choose.
Charles, as you love me,
take care of her.
I will. You may have no doubts.
I shall treat her
as if she were my own sister.
God be with all of you.
And remember your duties
to my lady and to England.
Let us pray.
His Holiness thanked God
for raising up such a prince...
...to be a champion of the Church.
And he expressed astonishment that
you found time to write the pamphlet.
Furthermore, in order
to show his gratitude...
...the Pope has decided to honour you
with a new title:
Fidei Defensor.
Fidei Defensor.
Defender of the faith.
But Your Majesty should know
that Martin Luther...
...has also responded to your work.
- What did he say?
- Well, he accuses you of...
Yes?
He accuses you of raving
like a strumpet in a tantrum.
What?
He says, " If the king of England
gives himself the right...
...to spew out falsehoods,
he gives me the right...
...to stuff them back down
his throat."
He ought to be burned.
Give me a hand with these ropes.
This is your stateroom. I hope it meets
with Your Highness's approval.
It will serve.
The bed is narrow but adequate.
And in case of action,
all this panelling will be removed.
- Action?
- Lf we are attacked.
- Who will attack us?
- Pirates.
It seems to me, Your Grace...
...we have more to fear
from the pirates already onboard.
- Good morning, madam.
- Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, Lady Anne Clifford.
Your Majesty.
Your Gracious Majesty. ;
It causes me such pain and grief
to return the gifts you gave me.
Alas, they are too beautiful
and I unworthy to receive them.
I think I never gave Your Majesty
cause to give them to me...
...since I am nothing
and you are everything.
Give them, I pray you...
...to a lady more deserving
of Your Majesty's affections.
I am leaving now
for my family's house at Hever.
I shall think of you
on the journey there.
"Your loving servant...
...Anne Boleyn."
- Mr. Pace?
- At your service, sir.
You are to be released.
I don't know anything.
What's that?
I said, you're to be released.
I told my wife.
I said, I don't know anything,
anything at all.
You told your wife, Mr. Pace? When?
She's sleeping.
We talk together.
I thought she had died
when she gave birth to our son.
I was sure
I went to the funeral and wept.
But now...
...I see she's alive...
...and as well as I.
Do you not see her?
Yes, Mr. Pace. I see her.
Mr. Cromwell.
Eminence.
I have long noticed
your aptitude for work...
...and your diligence
in carrying through my affairs.
And your discretion.
Well, I am grateful to Your Eminence.
You are of obscure stock.
But then, so am I.
It should not be held against you.
I may have a proposition
to put to you.
Thank you, Your Eminence.
By the terms of our treaty
with the emperor...
...we are obliged
to support his war effort financially.
At present, his armies are fighting
the French in Italy, near Milan.
Unfortunately, I have calculated
that in order to meet our obligations...
...we shall be obliged to raise taxes.
A bill will be presented to Parliament
at the next session.
- Good, good.
- I trust the bill will pass successfully.
I am sure, Your Eminence,
with your guiding hand, it will be so.
At least our alliance
with the emperor is popular.
Although sometimes I ask myself
why that should be so.
Because he's not French.
Right.
The new warship
is commissioned at Portsmouth.
I forgot to mention to Your Majesty...
...we have a new visitor at court,
Princess Marguerite of Navarre.
I received her myself yesterday.
I found her
a beautiful young woman...
...with a very sweet
and yielding disposition.
She confessed a great admiration
for Your Majesty.
Should I arrange...?
Yes. Yes, do it.
With Your Majesty's permission,
I intend to appoint a new secretary...
...instead of Mr. Pace.
Yes.
We're coming up from England.
Their whores are the best
in the world.
Even if you can't understand
a word they say.
They don't talk to me.
They always have their mouths full.
There you are, Your Grace.
My king has your queen.
Well, I was rather hoping
that the knave would get the queen.
- Eminence.
- Your Majesty.
May I present
Princess Marguerite of Navarre?
- Madame.
- Majesty.
You are visiting here?
Oui, Majesty, the count...
...my husband, had to stay behind
in France, regrettably.
Indeed. Very regrettable, madame.
But you must be compensated.
You must enjoy
some pleasures whilst here.
I have some news
which may interest Your Grace.
The Bishop of Winchester
died six months ago.
Winchester is the richest parish
in England.
Wolsey is supposed
to appoint his successor.
And he just did.
He appointed himself.
How much more wealth
does that man want?
- There's more.
- Tell me.
It appears that he's been using
the king's money...
...to invest his new college in Oxford
and his own personal foundation.
He closes down the worst monasteries,
strips them of their assets...
...as he is supposed to do.
But instead of transferring
all the profit to the privy purse...
...he makes the profits disappear.
God. You must tell
the king right away.
Forgive me, Your Grace,
but we must judge the time exactly.
Such is Wolsey's hold
over the king...
...that whatever the evidence,
the king won't believe it.
There will come a point
when the king's belief in his minister...
...will hang in the balance.
And then, Your Grace,
we shall drop our truth into the scales.
And the scales will fall.
Great hunting this weekend.
Dear Thomas.
Majesty.
Come and stay at court. I need you.
I'll give you great chambers.
Compton has great chambers.
You can have his.
Much as I love Your Majesty...
...I like my chambers
to have my family inside them.
Indeed.
His Majesty loves you above
anyone else, Mr. More, you know that.
That may be true.
And yet if my head
were to win him a casque in Spain...
...I think he would cut it off.
Mr. Wyatt.
Your Majesty.
I hear you're a poet.
I write poems.
I don't know how to be a poet.
I have read some. I like them.
My lord, I don't know what to say.
Were you in love with Anne Boleyn?
I...
Cardinal Wolsey
tells me you were once engaged.
No, that's not true.
Did you love her?
Lady Anne is so beautiful,
it is the duty of every man to love her.
Of course I loved her,
but from a distance.
Personally, I have a wife.
Enjoy the feast.
Thomas? Thomas Tallis.
Hello.
We just wanted to say
we love your music.
Thank you.
We share a room.
Do you want to come back with us?
- I want to finish this song.
- Finish it tomorrow.
I'll have forgotten it by tomorrow.
And you'll forget us too.
Compton, my friend...
...what do you think
of Princess Marguerite of Navarre?
She's well-built, Your Majesty.
Little heavy in the top decks
for my taste, though.
She's Francis' sister.
I happen to know that.
- Mon Dieu, Henri.
- Mon Dieu, Henri.
Happy to take your money anytime.
You just save your money, captain,
for when we get to Lisbon.
Good night.
Out of the way.
Make way. Make way.
A messenger from the emperor,
Your Majesty.
Well, what is it?
The emperor has won
a great victory against the French.
- What are you saying?
- At the Battle of Pavia five days ago.
The emperor's army
totally overcame those of the French.
The French army was destroyed.
My God.
Is this true?
Not only that, the French king himself
was also captured on the battlefield.
Francis? King Francis was captured?
Yes, Your Majesty.
He is now the emperor's prisoner.
You are as welcome here
as the angel Gabriel.
Feed yourself.
Great news. We must celebrate.
Huzzah!
Point to Mr. Anthony Knivert.
Well done, Tony.
I tell you, William, I will be called
a knight today or I never will be.
His Majesty, the king.
His Majesty.
- My queen.
- My lord.
My lady.
Godspeed, Your Majesty.
You see how popular
the queen is with the people?
She is the daughter
of Isabella and Ferdinand.
Perhaps the people
think she is what a queen ought to be.
Mr. William Compton
takes His Majesty's challenge.
You seem out of sorts today.
I have reasons to be downcast
and pained...
...but they needn't bother you.
Why should we not have pains?
Some people think we ought
to go to heaven in feather beds.
But that is not the way.
For our Lord himself
went there in pain and tribulation.
Not that I'm suggesting
that you're like that, of course.
Are you ready?
I was born ready, William.
Your Majesty.
Huzzah!
A point for His Majesty, the king.
Do not look at me.
I ask you privately
to do something for me.
Take this letter to the emperor.
You will do this for me...
...and not show it to anyone
or speak a word about it.
Again.
Come on. Get him there.
Huzzah! Two points for His Majesty.
"I was distressed
you would not accept the brooches.
They were made for you,
not for anyone else.
And why are you not worthy
when I deem you so?
For certain,
it must be plain to you now...
...that I desire
to find a place in your heart..."
Wait. Give it to me.
Give it.
"That I find a place in your heart...
...and your grounded affection."
- Grounded affection?
- Grounded.
"Tell me at least
that we can meet in private.
I mean nothing more
than a chance to talk to you."
- I beg you, come back to court soon.
- Give it back, brother.
Meanwhile, accept this new gift
and wear it for my sake."
What gift? And where is it?
Oh, holy Jesus.
Bring it here, lads.
Very, very good rider.
When will you bring my niece
back to court?
Soon, I think.
Now the king's appetite is whetted.
What's this?
Just a trick, Your Majesty.
Just a trick.
His Majesty, the king
and Mr. Anthony Knivert, en plaisance.
Ready? Lance.
The king's forgotten his visor.
Hold. Hold. Hold.
Hold.
Majesty. Your Majesty.
- I'm not hurt.
- Let me see.
- Not your eyes, thank God.
- Cloth.
See? See?
Your Majesty.
Will you forgive me? Will you?
It's not your fault, Anthony.
It's all my fault. It's my fault.
- You didn't hurt me. You can't hurt me.
- No.
Let's run again.
Henry. Henry.
Madam, have no fear.
I intend to ride again...
...and prove to everyone
that I am well and unharmed.
If you insist,
but I would much rather you did not.
My lady.
Arm yourself.
Yes.
Are you ready for me, Anthony?
People of England,
your king is unharmed.
Lance.
He's breathing.
Get a physic, quick.
Knivert!
Anthony. Anthony.
You wanted to see me,
Your Highness?
Only to ask how much longer
we must be at sea.
With a fair wind, two more days.
Do you play cards, Your Grace?
Sometimes, Your Highness.
What game shall we play?
You choose.
French ruff.
You pick trumps.
- Kings.
- How appropriate, Your Highness.
Wine?
As you please.
Your Highness
must be looking forward...
...with great anticipation
to your wedding.
I hear the king
was a great horseman in his time.
And famous
for his beautiful mistresses.
Don't tease me. I don't like it.
Will you like it when an old man
tries to make love to you?
Your Grace goes too far already.
Gospel says
the truth will make you free.
Now you are blasphemous.
My poor lady should not hear you.
My lady.
- My lady.
- My lady.
I want you to leave.
Do you?
Yes. Now.
Pity.
I had a winning hand.
Send a message to the emperor.
Tell him of our joy and contentment
at his great victory at Pavia...
...and his capture of the French king.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Ask him what he intends to do
with Francis.
And whether or not,
with Francis captive...
...it may not be a good time
to think about striking France itself.
Tell him we have gold,
men and ships at his disposal...
...and are eager to do battle
and share some of his glory.
Yes, I shall.
Your Majesty,
this is your new secretary.
This is Thomas Cromwell.
He is a trained barrister...
...a diligent man and a scholar.
He will be very useful
for Your Majesty.
- Mr. Cromwell.
- Your Majesty.
Ladies.
And back, of course.
May I see you privately?
Sweetheart.
My lady.
Why does Wolsey open my letters?
Am I not the queen of England?
- Are you sure he does?
- I am sure.
Then I shall stop it.
Cardinal Wolsey can be too zealous.
But it is always in our interest.
Unless you have secrets.
Mr. Anthony Knivert.
- Anthony.
- Majesty.
- You almost lost an eye.
- Never use that one much anyway.
Kneel.
I dub thee Sir Anthony Knivert.
Arise, Sir Anthony,
and be recognised.
Mr. William Compton.
Why so reproving a look,
Sir Anthony?
Majesty, I nearly lost an eye
for the same reward.
But you never carried a tree.
William.
Kneel.
So that is why it is to be understood
that the Pope...
...far from being
a descendant of St. Peter...
...is a sinner, a hypocrite,
a handmaiden to the devil...
...the living Antichrist on earth.
This is what Luther teaches us...
...in order to free us
from false worship and false idols.
In order that we might return
to the true religion...
...and take the true and fruitful path
to salvation.
Our message of hope,
of liberty, of truth...
...is already spreading throughout
Europe from one corner to the other.
Here in England...
...we have planted a seed
that will, with prayer, with action...
...and perhaps even with sacrifice,
grow one day...
...to become a great tree whose
branches will overreach the kingdom...
...and destroy the putrid
monastic houses of the Antichrist!
And this tree...
...this tree will be called
the Liberty Tree.
And in its branches, all the angels
of the Lord will sing hallelujah.
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.
I've dreamt of this moment
a long time.
Anne, you must know I desire you
with all my heart.
Anne.
The young man
you were dallying with earlier...
...who was he?
My brother, George.
- Her Majesty expects me.
- Later.
Who was that, Your Majesty?
Just a girl.
Your new kingdom.
- The king must be looking forward to...
- Don't.
I forbid you.
I should hate you.
But you don't.
I know you don't.
What will I do?
Save me.
Margaret.
You are even more handsome
than your portrait.
I feel so greatly fortunate...
...that you are soon to
be my queen.
Everything here is
at your disposal.
I only want you to be happy...
...and to make me happy.
And then we will make children...
...many children...
...with God's help!
What are you doing?
What the king ordered.
Perhaps you don't understand.
But I can't sleep, I can hardly breathe
for thinking of you.
Your image is before my eyes
every waking second.
I almost believe
that I would sacrifice my kingdom...
...for an hour in your arms.
I beg you...
...name some place
that we can meet and when.
Where I can show you truly an affection
which is beyond common affection.
Written with the hand
of your servant, Henry.
Now he is your servant?
With some subtle care
and the lure of your flesh...
...he may become
something even closer.
Did His Majesty?
Hold.
- What is it?
- Ground's too boggy.
We're gonna have to go around.
Says who?
We can't jump this ditch,
Your Majesty.
You mean you can't jump this ditch.
Flagpole.
- Majesty?
- Yes, Sir Anthony?
What are you doing?
I'm gonna vault this stupid ditch.
Nothing stands in the way
of me and my sport.
Are you sure?
Just watch and see
what the king of England can do.
Your Majesty!
Fetch a physician, quickly.
With Your Majesty's permission,
may I dance with your wife?
When do you leave?
Tomorrow.
You can't.
Why can't I?
I've discharged my duty.
Why should I stay?
You have a life to lead.
It's strange.
Some men who seem
at the peak of health...
...who are still young
and full of life...
...suddenly collapse and die.
By that same counter...
...some old men
whose bodies look worn out...
...whose race seems run...
...they can go on for years.
Don't you think it's strange?
Do you tease me
because it amuses you?
Why else?
Because you love me.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty,
we would like to bleed you a little...
...to drain away the bile which is
causing Your Majesty so much pain.
With your permission.
Yes.
I almost died.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- No!
Not "Yes, Your Majesty."
I almost died! Don't you understand?
Since that moment,
I've done a great deal of thinking.
What if I had died?
What would I have left?
I have no heir.
Only a daughter and a bastard son.
You understand, Wolsey?
The Tudor dynasty, gone.
All my father's work finished.
And it's my fault.
I have lived too long for pleasure.
I never even thought of the future.
I married my brother's wife
and God has punished me.
I've been such a fool.
Now everything has changed.
Everything.
I want a divorce.
And you will get one for me.
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.
Sir Thomas Boleyn, you are,
by order and permission...
...of His Majesty, King Henry
today created Lord Rochford.
Arise, my lord.
Majesty.
Henry Fitzroy.
Henry Fitzroy, you are, by order
and permission of His Majesty...
...King Henry, today created
Duke of Richmond and of Somerset...
...and Earl of Nottingham.
Arise, Your Grace.
His Eminence, Cardinal Wolsey.
Your Majesty.
I see His Majesty's bastard son
is made a duke.
Does this mean he is next in rank
to His Majesty?
Next in line to the throne?
Above my daughter?
Yes. Technically.
He is set above all others,
except for a legitimate son.
His Majesty loves our daughter.
He has shown it on many occasions.
I cannot believe he wishes to place
his bastard child above her.
I do not believe...
...that His Majesty...
...was personally responsible
for this action.
After all, our daughter
is engaged to the emperor.
Then Your Majesty has not heard?
The emperor has married
Princess Isabella of Portugal.
Apparently he decided it was not worth
waiting for your daughter to grow up.
Who is to say, perhaps
he was influenced by the fact...
...that the beautiful Isabella brought
with her a dowry of 1 million pounds.
He broke his word.
My Lord.
How your tok ens
and signs of affection frighten me.
How can I be to you
what you think me to be?
You know I am a commoner
and think myself unworthy of your love.
Though the offer of it and the passion
of Your Majesty's words and looks...
...touch both my heart and soul.
"You have flattered me with so many
and such wondrous gifts.
Allow me to send you
this token in return.
Small though it is.
And allow me to remain,
in all things...
...your ever-loving servant. Anne."
Your Grace.
Mama.
Now, Henry, listen to me.
You are going to own
your own house now.
You'll have lots of servants
to help you and look after you.
But you must promise me
to be a good boy.
And thoughtful and kind
to those around you.
You may be set above them...
...but if I find you have grown
too proud, I will be sad and displeased.
Yes, Mama. I promise.
And I promise I'll come
and see you as often as I can.
And I'm sure your new house
will be very grand.
I love you, my darling boy.
I love you.
Do you think they were suspicious?
Ever?
Of course they were suspicious.
Didn't you see the way
his servants looked at you?
But his son was overjoyed.
I mean, His Majesty was overjoyed.
After all, he had waited
many years for the crown.
The old man had hung on grimly.
You need not tell me about that.
What are we going to do?
- Isn't this enough?
- No.
Well, yes. And no.
I shall come to England eventually.
Marry me.
What?
You heard me.
Marry me.
My poor sister.
Indeed.
To be made queen for just a few days.
It seems incredible.
A tragedy.
Upon return, she's to be treated
to every comfort and kindness...
...while she mourns.
As to the great matter
of Your Majesty's annulment...
...I have set up an ecclesiastical court
with Archbishop Warham...
...to consider
and decide on the matter.
It will meet in secret,
if Your Majesty agrees.
Make sure they come
to the right decision, quickly.
I have some further news.
About the emperor.
He has released King Francis.
What?
- I have it on good authority.
- Under what terms?
I have yet to find out.
Why wasn't I consulted?
We are supposed to be allies.
What's he playing at?
Tell his ambassador
I want to see him.
Anne. Anne.
Anne...
...I want to say something to you.
If it pleases you to be
my true, loyal mistress and friend...
...to give yourself up to me,
body and soul.
I promise I'll take you
as my only mistress.
I won't have a thought
or an affection for anyone else.
If you agree to be
my maitresse en titre...
...I promise I shall serve only you.
- Your official mistress?
- Yes.
And you will have everything
you need.
Everything within my power
to give you to you, it's yours, just ask.
What is it?
What have I done to make you
treat me like this?
Done?
What fault have I committed?
Tell me. Tell me.
Your Majesty, I have already given
my maidenhead...
...into my husband's hands.
And whoever he is,
only he will have it.
Anne.
Because I know
how it goes otherwise.
My sister is called
The Great Prostitute by everyone.
I'm sorry if I offended you.
I did not mean to.
I spoke plainly of my true feelings.
Your Majesty...
- Your Majesty.
- Open the door.
- Your Majesty.
- What?!
Mary. Mary.
Go to your room. I will come later.
Another visit, Your Eminence.
You are always so busy.
Majesty, I have some good news.
Since His Majesty has given his son
the Duke of Richmond...
...his own establishment,
he considers it only right and proper...
...that his beloved Princess Mary
should also have hers.
What do you mean?
His Majesty intends to send
the princess...
...to Ludlow castle
in the Welsh Marches.
She will be under the care
of Lady Salisbury, her lady governess.
Her tutor, Dr. Fetherston,
will also accompany her...
...along with 300 members
of the princess's household.
She is to be taken away from me?
No. His Majesty is according her
the true honours of a princess.
This is your idea.
Madam, I am often accused of things
that are not my fault, or responsibility.
Some people are always prone
to speak evil...
...without knowledge of the truth.
I fear they may have poisoned
Your Majesty's mind against me.
You are taking my child from me.
My child.
You are tearing her from me as if
you were tearing her from my womb.
I do as His Majesty commands.
No.
You are my enemy.
Your Majesty is unfair.
Get out of my sight.
Mary.
Mary.
The ambassador of His Highness
the Holy Roman Emperor.
Senor Mendoza,
I am not pleased to see you.
Majesty?
Your master has broken
all his promises.
He has taken our money
but used it against us.
He has negotiated a separate peace...
...with the king of France
and His Holiness the Pope...
...while neglecting
his friend and ally.
He has not kept faith.
Charles has nothing
but words for me.
Deeds he keeps for others.
The emperor would never
betray Your Majesty.
Never, he regards you as his uncle.
He...
His fucking uncle?! How old am I?
Well, Your Highness
must consider that you, yourself...
...may not always have kept
to your obligations.
After all, we received only
half the gold that was promised.
Your accusations are totally false.
Unacceptable.
I will answer
for my honourable conduct...
...whoever contradicts me.
Leave.
My Lord Rochford.
Yes, Your Honour?
The emperor sends you
his congratulations on your elevation.
What does the emperor care
about my elevation?
He cares to have friends
at the English court.
And pays for the privilege.
Does he have many friends here
already?
Several.
- You would know them.
- And what does friendship pay?
One thousand crowns a year.
I will certainly consider
His Highness's offer.
- Your Grace.
- My lord.
So how did you find
the imperial ambassador?
Stimulating.
Indeed?
I find him a man of great principle.
Indeed.
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah indeed.
My lord.
No, I was just listening.
Yes, l...
You have such a talent.
Orpheus himself
would be jealous I think.
Sir.
A very good day to you ladies.
- Isn't the music divine?
- Yes, I quite agree.
Ladies.
No, George. Please, give it back.
"I have given you my heart, now
I desire to dedicate my body to you."
No, please.
"Written by the hand of him
who in heart, body and will...
...is your loyal
and most ensured servant, HR."
And look. He's drawn a little heart
between the letters H and R.
Just imagine.
The king of England writing
to my little sister.
Promising to be her servant.
It's incredible.
- Give me the letter.
- He's in love with you.
Give me the letter.
You're not in love with him, are you?
He wants a divorce?
It's not a divorce.
King wants an annulment
on the grounds...
...that he was never married
in the first place.
By marrying his brother's wife...
...he has offended the laws
of both God and man.
He simply wants that recognised.
The pope gave him a dispensation
to marry Catherine.
Indeed he did. No one denies it.
But the king feels
more beholden to God...
...than he does to the pope.
His conscience is genuinely stricken,
and tender.
He has disobeyed God's injunction...
...and there is nothing His Holiness
can say or do that can alter that.
The pope is God's representative
on Earth.
- He speaks for him.
- Come, come, Thomas.
What are you pretending?
Kings get divorced all the time.
And popes always find an excuse.
I know you're an idealist
but you're not stupid.
If Henry wants an annulment,
who's to stop him?
All right. You talk of fact.
Let me give you a fact.
Catherine is not only a great queen
and the daughter of kings...
...she is also immensely popular
throughout the country.
God forbid that the king should abandon
her just to ease his own conscience.
I don't think the English people
would ever forgive him.
Does she know yet?
Does she know yet?
Behold the cross on which
hung the saviour of the world.
Behold the cross on which
hung the saviour of the world.
Behold the cross on which
hung the saviour of the world.
The queen.
Good people of Lambeth.
On this Good Friday,
the Queen's Majesty will distribute...
...alms to you unfortunate...
...but true and loyal subjects
of Their Majesties...
...in the Christian spirit
of charity and love.
- Your Majesty.
- Bless you.
- Your Majesty.
- And you.
God be with you.
In good faith.
May you know him in deed.
In good faith.
I beseech you, help me.
God bless you.
Do not be afraid.
You are God's child.
Want some business?
Sorry, love.
My dear William.
Charles, welcome back.
Good to see you.
You too. Come sit down,
have a drink.
I don't understand. Why here?
We've been expecting you
back at court.
How is the king?
Anxiously awaiting his sister,
to share her grief.
We're married.
- What?
- She and me.
We're married.
- You and?
- Yes.
Here you are, sir. One for you.
You have to tell him.
You have to tell the king.
I have to tell him? Why do I have to?
Because it will be better
coming from you.
What's the matter?
Have you lost your nerve?
This is no laughing matter.
Then why did you do it?
You know me.
I don't always think.
Yes, you do. Just not with your head.
Henry.
Catherine,
I have something to tell you.
As far as I am concerned,
our marriage is at an end.
Actually, there is no need to end
something which has never been.
You and I were never truly married.
It was a misunderstanding
of scripture...
...and a papal misapplication
of canon law.
It's true I did not know
about these things before...
...but it has been brought to light
by learned opinion...
...and it weighs down
my conscience.
It has forced me to give up
your bed and board once and for all.
All that remains...
...is for you to choose
where to live...
...and to retire there
as quickly as possible.
I swear to you
all will be done for the best.
Your Grace, my lords.
I believe you know why we are
gathered here in private.
We are here
at His Majesty's bidding.
His Majesty has requested
an enquiry into the nature...
...of his marriage
to Catherine of Aragon...
...for the tranquillity of his conscience
and the health of his soul.
For as it says in Leviticus:
"If a man shall take his brother's wife,
it is an impurity...
...he has covered
his brother's nakedness...
...they shall be childless."
Now, if, my lords, we are able to agree
between ourselves...
...that the marriage was, in fact,
never legal...
...and was proceeded with against
both canon and ecclesiastical law...
...as His Majesty, to his great regret,
has come to believe...
...then it is my understanding
that, as papal legate...
...I myself have the power and authority
to dissolve and end it.
Of course
I would be grateful to hear...
...the opinions of your lordships
on this great matter.
Your Grace?
I am inclined to agree
with Your Eminence...
...though I reserve judgement
until I have heard all opinion.
My Lord Fischer.
I see no merit in the king's case,
so expressed.
None whatsoever.
If there was any obstacle
to the king's marriage...
...then it was overcome
by the pope's dispensation.
The marriage was therefore legal.
As Your Eminence knows,
divorce is disallowed by the Church.
That is my opinion.
Madam, Lady Salisbury's here.
Your Majesty.
I have brought your daughter,
to say goodbye.
- My baby.
- Your Majesty must be reassured.
The princess will be well taken care of,
as befitting her station.
You will be sent regular reports
of her health and accomplishments.
And naturally, you will visit her...
...during the course
of Your Majesty's progresses.
You must make sure
she practises her music.
She has a great facility for music.
Be strong, my daughter.
Remember who you are.
The descendent of Isabella
and Ferdinand of Castille.
The only daughter of the
king of England.
Be strong, and be true,
and one day...
One day you will be queen.
Yes, Mama.
Is he sorry?
Does he repent it?
Tell me, does he beg
my forgiveness?
Your Majesty knows His Grace.
You mean he does not.
Send in my sister.
You are not wearing black.
No, Your Majesty.
But you are in mourning.
Your husband is dead.
I said your husband is dead.
He's alive. My husband is alive.
I gave you no permission
to marry Brandon, nor would I ever.
You gave me your promise.
I was free to choose.
I made no promise.
You are mistaken.
How dare you look at me?
I am your lord and master,
not your brother.
You are both banished from court.
You will relinquish
your London houses.
You will remove yourself
from my sight.
Do you understand?
Yes, Your Majesty.
- And Margaret?
- What?
I have yet to decide whether
to make your bedmate a head shorter.
Say yes.
Say yes.
- You're married.
- So?
So...
- Why deny me?
- I do not love you.
- Is that all?
- For me, yes.
You're so beautiful, Tom.
You're a lord.
What am I?
A genius.
What is it?
A parcel, Your Majesty.
Who is it from?
The Lady Anne Boleyn.
A ship, with women on board.
What is a ship?
A ship is protection,
like the ark that protected Noah.
And the diamond?
What does it say
in the Roman de la Rose?
"A heart as hard as a diamond,
steadfast, never changing."
She is the diamond.
And I am the ship.
She says yes.
King Francis is eager
for a rapprochement...
...with Your Majesty.
He is disgusted
at the treacherous behaviour...
...of the emperor towards you.
Behaviour he knows only too well
having suffered it himself at firsthand.
And offers you instead
a true and lasting friendship.
It is true,
the emperor has betrayed us.
Perhaps he was never sincere
in the first place.
Even so, he still has friends at court.
Which friends?
My agents intercepted this letter.
The letter is from the queen.
She asks why the emperor
doesn't write to her more often.
And promises, as always,
to be his true and humble servant.
His servant. Not mine.
Tell the French ambassador
that we are in the mood...
...for a rapprochement
with King Francis.
Tell him to send delegates.
Let us be allies
against this emperor.
My lady.
I lay claim to your maidenhead.
And I make you this promise.
When we are married,
I will deliver you a son.
No.
I shall honour your maidenhead
until we are married.
No less could I do for love.
Oh, my love.
Love.
By daily proof, you shall me find,
to be to you both loving and kind.
I hate you.
You said it would be all right.
You said he would believe you.
- You promised.
- For the love of God, wife.
Don't call me "wife."
I don't want to be your wife.
I hate you.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
If it weren't for you,
I would still be the queen of Portugal.
- And now what am I?
- You are drunk.
And you are foolish.
Henry will forgive us.
He's just standing on his pride.
We just wounded his vanity.
Believe me.
Why should I?
I don't know if you're really brave
or if you're just a fucking fool.
Neither do I.
God.
Thank you, Alice.
I know you've talked to Wolsey.
And I know you do not approve
of what I am trying to do.
It's against your conscience.
And I'm not going to try
and change your mind.
That's unlikely in any case.
But I need you to understand,
Thomas.
I need to explain.
I have been living
with my brother's wife...
...and I have come to believe
their marriage was consummated.
If that is true,
then I have been living in sin.
Can you understand
what that feels like, Thomas?
That is why I asked the cardinal
to examine the matter.
What if it can be proved
that the pope's dispensation was valid?
That there was no sin?
Then I shall be
the happiest man alive.
I shall be content to live with Catherine
until the end of my days.
Wait.
I ask you again.
If the king is so troubled
by his conscience...
...why has he waited so long
to bring this matter to a head?
Because of his love for the queen,
he has denied the truth to himself.
But her failure to produce
a living son is proof of it.
Then he'll want to remarry?
If his marriage is annulled, then, yes,
I am certain he will remarry...
...in the hope of producing an heir.
He has an heir.
I do not believe for a moment...
...that the English people will accept
his bastard son as a legitimate heir.
- Nor does the king.
- He has a legitimate daughter.
My lords, English history
is littered with the tragedies...
...of those who have tried to pass
on their crown to a daughter.
Then he has a new wife in mind?
He has a mind to take one, yes.
It stinks.
I think you should be careful,
my lord.
As should you.
One of the great advantages
of having a library...
...is that it is full of books.
And some of these books
contain ecclesiastical law.
And according to those books...
...you have no authority
to judge this matter.
It is for the pope alone,
or those whom he appoints.
It seems that in this case...
...your reach
has exceeded your grasp.
So I have invited a French delegation
to visit Your Majesty's court...
...to discuss a new treaty,
binding us together...
...in the face of the emperor's
intransigence and aggression.
Good. Excellent.
And since the emperor
has reneged on his promise...
...to marry your daughter,
it could perhaps be politic...
...to resurrect her betrothal
to the dauphin.
Or if the dauphin is already promised
perhaps to the Duke of Orleans...
...King Francis' youngest son.
And what of your secret sessions?
Have they come to a decision?
How soon can I expect
my annulment?
Your Majesty should
not be concerned but...
We were not able to come
to a conclusion.
- Not able?
- The matter is a complex one.
Really? How?
It is my considered opinion...
...that we should apply to His Holiness,
Pope Clement...
...for a ruling on this matter.
Since he loves Your Majesty,
I am certain he will rule in your favour.
I hope so.
I certainly do hope so.
For your sake.
- You can always tell the French.
- Oh, yes.
Ponces.
But they never did anything so clever
as giving Wolsey a pension.
He's never failed them.
We must wait and see.
When the wheel of fortune
has reached its zenith...
...there is only one way for it to go.
Move aside, move aside.
Out of my way.
I bring most important news.
Your Majesty,
Rome has been sacked.
Let him through.
Your Majesty, I bring
most terrible and calamitous news.
Rome has been captured and sacked by
the German and Spanish mercenaries.
They have plundered
and befouled its churches...
...destroyed its relics
and holy treasures...
...tortured and killed thousands
of its priests.
What of His Holiness?
The pope is a prisoner
in the Castel St. Angelo.
He is the emperor's prisoner?
Yes.
Lady Blount.
He caught the sweating sickness.
There was nothing we could do.
He complained this morning
of feeling ill.
And by this evening,
he was in the hands of God.
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.
"Dear heart,
I cannot say how much I miss you.
I wish myself,
especially in the evening...
...in my sweetheart's arms, whose..."
Pray continue.
"Whose pretty breasts
I trust shortly to kiss.
Neither tongue nor pen can
express the hurt of not seeing you.
The only compensation is the thrill
of anticipating our next meeting.
For what joy in this world
can be greater...
...than to have the company of her
who is the most dearly loved?"
Well, the king
is plainly in love with you.
Don't you see, niece?
It makes a man, any man,
extremely vulnerable.
How do you like
your charge, sweetheart?
I...
At first, I confess,
I did not like it so much.
I did not care for the king.
But now, I...
- Now I...
- Anne.
It would be wise for you not to be
fooled by your own masquerade.
It is your duty to use his love...
...to our advantage
in supplanting Wolsey.
The cardinal
stands between us and everything.
And it is now in your power
to do him a great hurt.
And we expect you to do so.
I shall go straight to Paris
to meet King Francis...
...and ratify the new treaty
between Your Majesties.
And since His Holiness
remains a prisoner of the emperor...
...I have summoned
a conclave of the cardinals...
...to meet in Paris.
It will be little matter to persuade
them, in the absence of the Pope...
...to grant me licence and authority...
...to make a final judgement
on Your Majesty's annulment.
You leave with our blessing.
And with anticipation of your
success, Your Eminence.
For which we are most impatient.
I'm Your Majesty's
true and humble servant.
Oh, I forgot.
There is someone you should take.
His name is Thomas Wyatt.
- The poet?
- I don't like him.
He once possessed
a jewel I would have.
Lady Anne, what are you doing here?
I have an audience with His Majesty.
What would a silly girl like you
have to say to a king?
Your Majesty.
Tell me he'll succeed.
Who, sweetheart?
Wolsey.
He will, won't he?
He'll get an annulment?
Of course he will.
Don't you doubt it.
What is it?
Is it not strange?
Strange?
To trust so great a matter
to just one servant, whoever he is?
When Your Majesty
has a thousand servants...
...ready and willing
to do your bidding?
And when your very happiness
hangs upon this resolution.
My love.
This should not concern you.
Forgive me.
I spoke of things I should not.
No, no.
I give you leave that we may always
speak freely with each other.
Honestly, openly
and with a true heart.
For me,
that is the true definition of love.
Forgive me, ambassador,
for receiving you here.
I am at Your Majesty's disposal.
Senor Mendoza, help me.
Of course, I am Your Majesty's.
I need to get a message to the emperor.
I have no other way.
Wolsey opens all my letters.
And now I know that he has turned
several of my women into his spies.
By what means?
By money, or even, so they tell me,
by granting them sexual favours.
Dear God. How can I help?
The emperor is the head
of my family.
I want him to know that
the king is trying to divorce me.
He wants to keep it secret, but he has
already instigated proceedings.
It's impossible!
Surely he needs
the Pope's permission?
But the Pope is still the
emperor's prisoner.
Senor Mendoza...
...for the love of our saviour,
Jesus Christ...
...and the love of all that is sacred...
...tell my nephew what is
being done to me here!
Leave it to me.
I will find a way to evade
the cardinal's spies.
What are you thinking about?
I wasn't thinking.
I was listening.
You working on something new?
To work on something
I have to hear it.
I love you.
What about your wife?
You know very well
she's not my wife.
I never believed that love
should be bound by doctrine.
I'm going away.
You're going away? Why?
Cardinal Wolsey is going to France.
He invited me to go with him.
With other musicians.
Must you go?
You know very well
that an invitation from a cardinal...
...is like an invitation from a king.
We little people must put our hands
into the fire if invited to.
I'll miss you.
No, you won't.
You'll soon find other distractions.
Tell me truthfully.
What are your hopes for this mission?
I have many hopes.
Firstly, to heal the wounds caused
by years of Anglo-French hostility.
And then to work towards
a new balance of power in Europe.
The sacking of Rome,
the imprisonment of the Pope...
...these things have destabilized
the whole of Europe.
And the Church?
The Church is also
in need of mediation.
At the conclave, we shall lay plans
for a general council which...
...in the absence of the Pope...
...will deal with pressing matters
of heresy and reform.
And the king's matter?
That will also be dealt with. But as
one of a number of other matters.
Do you think the cardinals will
give you the authority to deal with it?
- Yes.
- Then you will be de facto Pope.
And since His Holiness
may never escape captivity...
This is idle speculation.
I have work to do, Sir Thomas.
Why are you sitting in the darkness?
What's wrong?
- You don't understand.
- Of course I do.
I'm your brother, aren't I?
If only you were still
as you used to be.
I remember I told you everything.
All my secrets.
- You can still tell me.
- I can't.
Why?
You'd share them.
Your Majesty.
We salute you, Cardinal Pacificus,
cardinal of peace.
Eminence.
Enchante, Madame.
As beautiful as ever, like the sun.
You are very gracious,
Monsieur Cardinal.
And we treat you as a brother,
for that is what you are.
A true and loyal friend of France.
We welcome you...
...and all those with you,
into our court and into our hearts.
I am greatly honoured, Your Majesty.
And very touched.
- This is nothing.
- Tallis.
Mr. Wyatt.
I've been thinking.
Perhaps you would set
a poem of mine to music.
I'd be honoured.
Do you have one ready?
I'm working on one.
I have the first line.
Then you have almost everything.
Bonjour, Monsieur Cardinal.
Bonjour, Your Grace.
The Duke of Orleans is very glad
to be betrothed to Princess Mary.
Very, very happy.
Charming.
You don't like the French much,
do you, Sir Thomas?
I don't mind them, Mr. Wyatt.
It's just that they're always
so very French.
Were there any letters for me?
No letters, madam.
Lady Anne.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I know what you are doing.
But do not think
to take the king away from me.
Let him play with you.
Let him give you gifts.
But he cannot give you
his true heart.
For I have that in my keeping.
Letters from His Eminence
Cardinal Wolsey.
Your Majesty should know
that His Holiness Pope Clement...
...has escaped Castel St. Angelo.
He's escaped?
Apparently, he dressed
as an old blind man...
...and walked out past his captors.
Where is he now?
According to my information,
in an Italian town called Orvieto...
...in the bishop's palace there,
with his court.
Of course, he is still within
the power of the emperor.
And yet he is free?
It would be possible...
It would be possible
to send someone to him?
To give him a message?
Indeed, it would be possible.
How do you know all this?
From Wolsey?
No, Your Majesty.
I have my own sources.
Let us say I wanted a message
carried to His Holiness.
Do you know someone? Someone
you could trust with your life?
Dr. Knight. A man of God.
A diplomat. And a true Englishman.
Bring him to me.
So that's how he does it.
Call.
My two queens win.
I hate cards.
I hate this court.
I even hate time itself.
Your Majesty,
might I make a suggestion?
Anything.
Forget the court.
Let's go to the woods.
Let's go for a hunt.
As we used to do.
Yes, yes.
But not Brandon.
- Charles is your...
- I haven't forgiven my Lord Suffolk.
I can't forgive him.
He never asked permission
to marry my sister.
It's insufferable arrogance.
I mean, what did he expect?
Look.
I don't mean
that he's banished forever.
Just as long as he breathes.
Come on.
You know what we should do?
- What, sweetheart?
- Have a picnic.
At Compton's place.
Keep your eyes open.
Walk them round.
You see, William?
Things can never be
as they used to be.
Sir Thomas Boleyn, Your Grace.
- My lord.
- Your Grace.
- To what do I owe this pleasure?
- May I speak frankly?
To your health, my lord.
And yours.
Norfolk has sent me.
But Norfolk hates me.
I am a new man, after all.
And he is far too grand for me.
I suspect he despises us all
for the same reasons.
And yet he has interests
to protect and further...
...like the rest of us.
He must deal with us
as he finds us.
And, after all, there is
someone he hates even more.
- The cardinal.
- Of course.
But what is that to me?
Do you miss the court, Your Grace?
Perhaps you don't.
Down here, in this green space...
...you have so much leisure to enjoy.
So many idle pursuits.
Yet I have heard it said by some...
...that the king's presence
is like the sun.
And when you are away from it...
...there is only eternal night.
You're a clever man, Boleyn.
That is what people say.
They say you are
charming and clever.
What does Norfolk want?
He wants you to help us
destroy Wolsey.
And in return, he will persuade
the king to forgive you...
...and welcome you back to court.
Thank you, my lord.
What did you hear?
Everything.
What will you do?
What should I do?
You once told me...
...that sometimes Wolsey
had been kind to you.
Did I?
I had quite forgotten.
It seems Our Majesty is in love.
Sir.
Poor Harry.
Tallis?
What is it?
Bloody poets never sleep.
I've written the first few lines.
Can I read them to you?
They flee from me
That sometime did me seek
With nak ed foot
Stalking in my chamber
I have seen them
Gentle, tame and weak
That are now wild
And do not remember
That sometime
They put themselves in danger
To tak e bread at my hand
And now they range
Busily seeking
With a continual change
- That's all there is so far.
- It's wonderful.
There is music in it.
What's it about?
- A girl.
- What girl?
Let's just call her the brunette.
I loved her once.
And I thought she loved me.
But now she belongs to another?
Quiet in here.
She may be just a girl,
but I tell you this, Mr. Tallis...
...if she gets her way...
...she will set
our whole country in a roar.
Thank you.
His Majesty wants assurance...
...that Your Eminence
has everything you desire.
Forgive me.
If I was younger, or more foolish,
or more alive...
...I would gladly take this offer.
You deserve better
than to be used as a whore.
My lords and ladies, the queen.
Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Grace.
Your Grace.
Your Majesty.
- Lord Darby.
- My queen.
I have something for you.
You see.
The falcon is your crest
and the pomegranate is hers.
You still don't understand, do you?
It's not a game, George.
It's dangerous.
Mistress Boleyn.
- Mr. Cromwell.
- I have some news.
The king is dispatching a good man
to see the Pope about the divorce.
A Dr. Knight.
I know Dr. Knight. He was my tutor.
Indeed. All things connect.
Ladies.
Sir.
Would I be right to think you
are maids of honour to Her Majesty?
Yes, sir.
George Boleyn.
You don't know me now
but one day you will.
- We could be useful to each other.
- How so?
You tell me who you're fucking...
...and I'll tell you if it's a good idea.
You understand?
And in return?
I'll think of something.
It depends how hungry you are
to be rich and famous.
It's something I can arrange.
I'm a builder of fortunes.
Here.
We rely upon you, Dr. Knight...
...to deliver these two bulls
to His Holiness, at Orvieto.
They were written by our own hand.
Majesty.
It would be better for Europe...
...if we now make peace
with the emperor.
How can you say that?
He made me his prisoner.
He squeezed my balls.
I had to pay him millions in ransom.
And my eldest son is still his captive.
How can I make peace
with that piece of shit?
You must be gratified
by the progress you've made so far.
It's something of a burden...
...dragging my old body
from country to country.
You'd rather be at home.
I do fret, rather, that the king
will be influenced...
...by others in my absence.
After the conclave,
you need not fret.
You'll soon have the power
to please him.
Evening, my lord.
Thank you.
Boy.
Boy.
Damn you.
The king.
Sweet Anne.
The queen.
No, no. Wait.
Only a moment.
Tonight I dine
with your father and uncle.
Your Majesty, my father says
it is all beyond his deserving.
No.
For when I am with them,
I am close to you.
Here.
Another token of my affection.
Take it. From your humble servant.
Your neck.
I love your neck.
My lords, let us drink...
...to the resolution of the matter
which is uppermost in our minds.
- Your Majesty.
- Majesty.
In a very short while,
we shall have an answer.
I would trust to hear it more
from Dr. Knight than Cardinal Wolsey.
Why do you say?
I fear it is not in the cardinal's
interest to succeed.
But surely his interests and mine
are one and the same?
He is my servant.
His Grace means that the cardinal...
...has some prejudice
against my daughter.
I know. I know.
He called her a silly girl.
She told me.
There is another matter.
My lord did not want to tell you.
But it is something I think Your Majesty
should be made aware of.
Well?
Majesty...
...by your great bounty,
I was appointed...
...comptroller
of Your Majesty's household.
And in such a capacity...
...I have discovered that when corrupt
religious houses are closed down...
...instead of their assets
going to your exchequer...
...as they should do...
...they are often diverted elsewhere.
Elsewhere?
Into Wolsey's private foundations.
Into the creation
of his college at Oxford.
I must admit...
...I find your intimations shocking.
Indeed, I am hurt.
Cardinal Wolsey
is not only my chancellor...
...he has always been my friend.
In this world, Majesty,
a true and loyal friend...
...is the greatest boon
any man can have.
For in everything else,
there is a strange habit of forsaking.
That reminds me,
the Duke of Suffolk came to see me.
- Brandon?
- He said...
...he would crawl
on his hands and knees...
...to beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.
The necklace. Who gave it to you?
Answer me.
His Majesty.
You are expensive, huh?
An expensive whore!
I am no whore...
...Your Majesty.
I love His Majesty.
I believe he loves me.
He is infatuated by you,
as men often are by new things.
Soon he will see you
for what you really are.
And he will tire of you...
...as all the others.
And what if he does not?
I did not give you permission
to speak.
You are a servant.
Go now.
Go.
- Who are you?
- Dr. Knight, forgive us, sir.
We must just ask you
to break off your journey.
Impossible.
I am on the king's business.
Yes, sir, we know that.
That is why you must come with us.
Dr. Knight, come in.
- Your Eminence...
- I make it my business...
...to know the king's business.
Did you really think you could go to
Orvieto without my knowing about it?
Now, you've been sent
by the king to the Pope...
...with these two bulls, is that correct?
Yes.
These are extraordinary documents.
Do you know what's in them?
- Yes, a little.
- And you still agreed to carry them?
The first document asks the Pope
to permit him, once divorced...
...to marry any woman he chooses...
...even one who would
be forbidden to him...
...because of a prior relationship
to one of her relatives.
I don't understand that.
The king wrote this.
- What woman is he referring to?
- Mistress Anne Boleyn.
Anne Boleyn?
The king loves Anne Boleyn?
Yes, sir.
And what is this prior relationship
he refers to?
Surely Your Eminence is aware
that His Majesty...
...had carnal relations
with Anne's older sister, Mary.
Perhaps even with their mother.
So it is rumoured.
I give it no credence.
With regard to the mother.
And the second document.
Have you read it?
- No, sir.
- Just as well.
I wouldn't like to be the man...
...that has to present this
to the descendant of Saint Peter.
It asks this: " If no way can be found
to nullify the king's marriage...
...then the Pope should
allow him to take a second wife."
Do you understand? He's asking
the Pope to sanction bigamy.
Since the king commands it,
you must be on your way, Dr. Knight.
But with no hope of success,
or honour.
I heard you crawled here like a dog.
- Something like...
- Hold your tongue.
You were always too useful with it.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Have you come
to beg my forgiveness?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Well, then beg for it.
With all my heart. With all my soul.
With every ounce of my being.
My king, my sovereign,
my dread lord...
...I beg you to forgive
your miserable servant...
...your humble, worthless,
thoughtless servant...
...who deserves so little...
...and by your bounty
and your grace...
...was given so much.
Ungrateful wretch that I am.
Unworthy of Your Majesty's love.
Come here.
If you can beat me...
...you can come back to court.
Ready?
Welcome back.
- What was I supposed to do?
- I don't know.
But I agree with you.
It was crude and unacceptable.
- I'm disappointed in His Majesty.
- Thomas, I have to ask you this.
Will you accept the judgement
of the cardinals?
What does it matter now?
The Pope is free.
- There is no need for a conclave.
- No, there is more need than ever.
The Pope is still
in the power of the emperor...
...unable to exercise any control
over the Church.
So someone else must do so
and I ask you again...
...will you accept
the judgement of the cardinals?
More, if you are not for me now,
then you are against me.
Stakes have grown higher.
Mr. Cromwell tells me that the king
now dines with Norfolk and Boleyn.
They are my bitter enemies.
They constantly seek my downfall.
And if you do not help me,
then you help them.
Need I remind you of this?
You owe all your advancement
in this world to me.
Thomas, we've known each other
a long time.
I know you've often complained
about my methods, my way of dealing.
But underneath all of that,
I believe we still share many things.
We're still humanists, even though
the world batters our beliefs...
...and compromises our actions.
Nothing, no earthly thing,
not even a prince...
...will ever compromise mine.
Oh, I see.
You don't want to get
your hands dirty. I understand.
Well, unfortunately,
you don't have a choice.
The dyer's hand is always stained
by the elements he works with.
Here is my element.
The spiritual element.
The higher element.
Now you tell me...
...am I stained by it?
Let me know the moment
the cardinals arrive.
Mon cher Wolsey.
I expect you heard.
The cardinals are not coming.
There's nothing I can do about it.
They only take orders
from His Holiness.
The wheel turns, my friend.
They flee from me
That sometime did me seek
With nak ed foot stalking
In my chamber
Thanks be to fortune,
It has been otherwise
Twenty times better
But once in special
In thin array, after a pleasant guise
When her loose gown
From her shoulders did fall
And she caught me
In her arms long and small
There with all sweetly did we kiss
And softly said,
"Dear Heart, how lik e you this?"
Out. Out.
Your Eminence,
your blessing on my daughter?
- Blessings, my child.
- Thank you, Your Eminence.
- Your Eminence, please, a moment.
- No, no.
- Now, Mr. Cromwell.
- Your Eminence.
- The king awaits you, but...
- What?
He is not alone.
Majesty.
Well?
Majesty, I was hoping that...
You can speak freely
in front of Mistress Boleyn.
She knows everything.
So. You've come back from Paris.
- Yes.
- Tell us of your triumphs.
Tell us all your news.
We are so eager to hear.
Oh, for the love of God, man.
Do I have my divorce?
Your Majesty will recall
that I went to Paris...
It was no dream.
I lay broad waking
But all is turned
Through my gentleness
Into a strange fashion
Of forsaking
And I have leave to go
Of her goodness
But since that
I so kindly am served
I'd lik e to know
what she has deserved
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.
Sir William.
- Sir William. What is it?
- Go and fetch the physician.
Go and get him now.
Sir.
Good God, man.
Why did no one wake him?
Sleep in these cases is fatal.
Keep away. Keep away, you fools.
Your master
has the sweating sickness.
You two. You, stay.
We must try and treat him.
Poor fellow.
Turn him over.
For the love of God, get on with it.
We may yet save him.
I'm going to cut into his back.
For I heard that it sometimes works.
It draws out some of the toxin.
Hold him now.
- What are you doing?
- May I not meet him?
God, woman, out. Out.
His Majesty the king
and Lady Anne Boleyn.
- Wolsey.
- Your Majesty.
Mistress Anne.
You are most welcome.
I must thank Your Eminence...
...for the magnificent brooch
you sent me.
I am so glad you liked it.
It is Italianate.
I thought the craftsmanship superb.
I'm sure Your Majesty
will be pleased...
...with the presents sent by the king
of France. A golden chalice...
...gold silk altar cloths...
...and tapestries worth,
I'm sure, at least 30,000 ducats.
So we are once more allies
with the French.
Indeed. And we are both officially
at war with the emperor.
Good. It pleases me.
As it pleased the emperor to announce
he has just had a son.
By the princess
he jilted my daughter for.
- How is the shrimp, Lady Anne?
- Perfect, Your Eminence.
Thank you. You are too generous,
in everything.
So, what of our personal matter?
Your Majesty, I have arranged
to send two of my colleagues...
...two young lawyers,
Stephen Gardiner, my secretary...
...and Edward Foxe, to meet the pope
at Orvieto, near Rome...
...where he still resides,
in wretched discomfort apparently.
What will you have these lawyers do?
They will press upon
His Holiness...
...the necessity for his cooperation.
He must recognise,
in both civil and canon law...
...the invalidity
of Your Majesty's marriage.
I have read countless texts
on the matter.
Sometimes reading well into the night
and giving myself terrible headaches.
But I am more assured now
than ever...
...of the spiritual and legal justice
of my case.
- My conscience is clear.
- As it should be.
And Your Majesty
must rest assured...
...that these two gentlemen,
these two restless lawyers...
...will not leave Orvieto
until they have attained satisfaction.
Good.
Very good.
Have you spoken recently
with the king?
No, Your Majesty.
Cardinal Wolsey refuses my requests,
and in a most high-handed manner.
It is something I have learned
about the English.
A small advantage makes them
overbearing...
...while the slightest adversity
makes them despondent.
I have received a coded letter from
your nephew, the emperor.
He declares his undying support
for you in this ugly matter.
You may wait for me here.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Pray continue.
He has already written a letter
to His Holiness Pope Clement...
...warning him of the king's
brutal intentions.
He has asked Clement to dismiss
Wolsey as official legate...
...and declare you and the king
legally married.
He tells you to be strong.
I try to be.
But so much now is hidden
from me.
Tell him that I trust in him more
than anyone else.
Except in God.
- Mistress Hastings.
- Dr. Linacre?
As soon as he heard the news,
the king sent me here.
Alas to no avail.
Mistress Hastings,
I know you were his common-law wife.
He was in every way
a most lovely and loving man.
His Majesty will miss
his companionship a great deal.
- Let me see him.
- There is a grave risk.
- About which we know so little.
- Please.
Oh, my poor, sweet darling.
Protect us from evil.
Forgive me.
You must burn all his bedding
and clothing.
He must be in the ground first thing.
Gentlemen, here is a personal letter
from the king to the pope...
...thanking him in advance
for attending to his suit...
...sympathetically.
How is His Holiness
likely to respond?
To be honest with you, Mr. Gardiner,
I am not absolutely sure.
The pope was an abused prisoner
of the emperor's mercenaries.
And even though the emperor reputedly
allowed him to escape to Orvieto...
...his condition continues to be
little better there.
He leads a most sad life,
locked up in a ruined castle.
In which case, why should the pope
favour the emperor...
...who has caused him nothing
but misery over the king of England...
...who has never caused him
any harm at all?
The trouble is, Your Eminence...
...the swords of the king of England
are much further away...
...than the swords of the emperor.
Diplomacy is nearly always settled
by such proximity.
Spoken like a true lawyer.
If all else fails, use threats.
Tell His Holiness...
...that if the king can't get satisfaction
from the papal court...
...he will find other means
to satisfy his conscience...
...and rid himself of his present wife.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, Eminence. We understand.
Godspeed, gentlemen.
The evening after William died,
his servants began stealing his effects.
In his will, he bequeathed
this to the king.
I managed to save it.
William is buried in the churchyard.
So too are the servants...
...who also caught and died
of the sweat in the last 24 hours.
I don't know what to say to you.
- My lord Norfolk.
- Your Eminence.
- What do you want?
- A word with you if I might.
- In private.
- Very well.
You are commanded
to return at once...
...to your estates in East Anglia.
Commanded?
- By whom?
- By His Majesty.
In his own hand.
What for?
His Majesty would like you
to supervise...
...grain production
and North Sea trade.
Trade?
Trade?
What do you take me for?
A butcher's son?
As you see, my lord,
these are not my orders.
Poor William. Is this all
that remains of an entire life?
We must see that these jewels
get back to his unfortunate lady.
William died at Warwickshire
which is a long way from here...
...and God willing,
the disease won't spread.
But you should fortify yourselves
against it in any case.
Now, these are plasters
to heal ulcers.
An unguent which
cools inflammation and stops itching.
This helps digestion,
this soothes dry skin.
And this ointment will comfort
your cock if it's sore.
Thank you.
These are called pills of Rasis.
They're named after the Turk
who invented them.
They are said to be good
against the sweating sickness.
But this infusion is even better.
What is it?
It's a mixture of marigold...
...Manus christi,
a very efficacious herb...
...sorrel, meadow plant,
linseed vinegar...
...ivory scrapings,
all mixed with sugar.
- Take some.
- Are you sure?
Someone told me taking infusions
was the worst thing.
Trust me.
It'll make you feel sick.
But it's better
than the sickness it prevents.
Mistress Hastings.
Bury her beside Sir William.
That's so beautiful.
It's just something for a friend.
Forgive me, I can't work unless I'm...
Of course.
Good night, Thomas Tallis.
Wait.
What's your name?
- Joan.
- Stay a moment.
Why me?
Do you think the world judges you
both the same?
Yes. It seems to.
I don't.
I see the differences between you.
When I looked at you,
I saw a light around your head.
A light?
You mean like a halo?
Yes. Like a circle of light.
You're weird.
May I kiss you, Joan?
- Good morning, chamberlain.
- Your Majesty.
May I present
His Highness Jean de Bellay...
...bishop of Bayonne,
the new French ambassador.
Your Majesty, I am happy
to present my credentials.
And I am happy to be once more
friend and ally to your master.
Thank him for his precious gifts.
It is a pleasure, Your Highness.
So, Your Excellence, how is the war
against the emperor going?
Your Majesty has no cause
for anxiety.
A French army and
a fleet of our allies, the Genoese...
...have hopelessly besieged
the emperor's soldiers at Napoli.
Sooner or later,
Charles must surrender...
...and leave Italy altogether.
That is truly excellent news.
Your Excellence,
allow me to introduce...
Is this not Mademoiselle Anne?
His Eminence, Cardinal Wolsey,
has told me all about you.
He did not tell how beautiful you are.
For a Frenchman, that is a crime.
But Frenchmen tell every woman
she is beautiful.
Is that not a crime too?
- I have a gift for you.
- For me?
For you, sir.
This dog is very fast...
...really formidable.
- What's his name?
- Wolsey.
You ought to be glad, sweetheart.
His Excellence has informed me...
...that the emperor is soon
to be driven out of Italy.
He will no longer be able to stand
in the way of our happiness.
Go back to your wife.
Halt! In the name of the king!
Did someone say something?
- Hold.
- What is that stink?
It's vinegar. Vinegar, Excellence.
- Your Majesty.
- What's happened?
There has been an outbreak
of sweating sickness.
- Three hundred deaths this day alone.
- Fetch Dr. Linacre quickly.
What about my wife, the queen?
What about the queen?
Anne, don't be afraid.
I'll see you soon.
George, take your sister
to her chambers.
I find from experience, Your Majesty,
that in a great many cases...
...before any actual
physical symptoms appear...
...the sufferers undergo
a curious mental disorientation.
A quick sense
of fear and apprehension.
A foreboding of pain and death.
Every rumour sends them
into agitated alarm.
Indeed, one rumour can itself
cause a thousand cases of sweat.
So thousands catch the disease...
...from fear
who need not otherwise sweat.
Especially if they observe
a good, wholesome diet.
A good, wholesome diet?
That is your best remedy, Dr. Linacre?
Not infusions?
I hope Your Majesty will trust me
when I tell you...
...that there are countless remedies
for the sweat.
Nearly all of them, in my opinion,
medically useless.
Even to ward it off?
Well, I heard of an interesting theory.
A young gentleman
of my acquaintance swears...
...that he can combat
the disease directly...
...by working himself
into a natural sweat...
...by exercise each night.
Thank you, doctor.
Bring out your dead.
My dearest wife and family.
This plague that has come upon us...
...is a punishment from God.
We are all sinners,
and God is displeased with us.
Whether we live or die
is entirely in his hands.
All we can do is pray...
...and appeal to his great
and infinite mercy...
...and acknowledge
our sinful natures...
...and our need for his grace.
So, what do you think?
Isn't that the best way
of working up a sweat?
Yes, Your Grace.
Get your husband to lick it off.
Child, what is it?
Nothing, madam,
I just felt a little dizzy.
- Well, come here.
- No, I...
I still feel dizzy, I...
That's it. I've caught the sweat.
No, gentle child.
It's just a headache.
- No more than that.
- It's not.
I have pains in my stomach.
Yes. Isn't that a sign?
How can you deny it?
- I'm going to die.
- No, you're not going to die.
Listen to me.
You are not going to die.
Come here. There.
"My poor maid has this day
caught the sweat and died.
I beg Your Majesty, what shall I do?"
I want to see her.
I would counsel against any contact
with infected persons...
...or those who have had contact
with infected persons.
You are the king of England.
Yes, but what if she?
What if she dies?
All right.
Tell her she must quit the palace.
She must go with her father
back to Hever...
...and by all means,
shut herself up there.
I will send her infusions
to fortify herself...
...and I will write to her.
And what of Her Majesty?
The queen will join our daughter
at Ludlow.
I pray to God
they will be safe enough in Wales.
And you, Your Majesty?
I will shut myself up here...
...and keep the sweat at bay
with every means.
Then if I may advise Your Majesty.
Keep as few people around you
as possible.
In that way, you can reduce
the risk of contamination.
God bless us both.
Indeed.
I've come to say goodbye.
Are you pleased to send me away?
- You do not want to see our daughter?
- You send me away...
...so that you can be with her.
- No, she's not...
- Do you mean Lady Anne Boleyn?
- Yes, I mean Lady Anne Boleyn.
You make no secret of her.
No, she's going back to Hever.
One of her maids died of the sweat.
Your fear of the sweat is greater than
your infatuation with your mistress?
Catherine, she is not my mistress.
I do not sleep with her.
Not whilst you and I are still married.
But do you tell her
that you love her?
Do you make promises to her?
Does she make promises to you?
Will you not tell me since,
as you say, I am still your wife?
Catherine, I wish with all my heart...
...you could accept our marriage
was based upon a lie.
And in the meantime...
...I still love you enough
to want to save your life.
Now do as I command.
Go to Wales.
When you speak like that, my love...
You act as though I had the plague.
As though love itself were a plague.
I shall write to you.
Tell Mary, the king, her father,
sends his love and devotion.
How do you feel?
- I feel fine, Papa.
- You're sure?
What are you saying?
Because of my maid...
...l'm certain to be contaminated?
- No, of course not.
What is it?
I can't breathe.
What?
- What's wrong?
- I can't breathe. Stop the coach.
- I can't breathe. Stop the coach!
- Halt.
Stop the coach.
Anne.
Drive on.
Anne.
Joan, my dear sister.
Father, it is well said and known...
...that sickness is a visitation from
God and a punishment for sins.
But why, Father, why is my land
so marked out for disfavour?
What have we done that has
displeased Almighty God so much...
...that he brings
this pestilence upon us?
Is it my fault?
Father, I ask forgiveness
for sins unknown.
And I beg you for your blessing.
Not as a king...
...but as a man.
Please, Father.
Father?
Father?
Father?
Are you the English envoys?
Come.
My sons.
Holy Father.
You see how I am forced to live?
Can you imagine
Your Father's misery?
The Spaniards are practically
at my doorstep.
Your Holiness knows
why we are here.
We bring a letter from His Majesty,
King Henry...
...the most dutiful and Catholic king
of England, Ireland and France.
His Majesty thanks
Your Holiness in advance...
...for your support of his nullity suit.
He knows that you, Holy Father,
will not object to our supplications.
I wish with all my heart...
...to please and satisfy your master.
But I must say to you,
in all honesty...
...as God is my witness,
as I am an honest man...
...that I have been advised that
this suit is prompted solely...
...by the king's vain affection...
...and undue love for this woman,
Anne Boleyn.
It has been said to me...
...that the king of England desires
his divorce for private reasons only.
And that the woman he loves
is far below him.
Not only in rank, but also in virtue.
Holiness, who has told you
these things?
They say
that Anne is already pregnant...
...and that the king urgently wishes
to make her child...
...his heir to the throne.
Lady Anne is a model of chastity.
Though very apt to procreate
children when the time comes.
Holy Father, she impresses everyone
who sees her or knows her...
...with the purity of her life,
her constant virginity...
...her soberness, meekness.
Indeed, of all the women in England...
...she is, by far,
the fittest to become queen.
But what of Queen Catherine?
His Majesty hopes
that when Your Highness has taken...
...cognisance of the arguments
we have brought with us...
...you will write to the queen
to urge her compliance.
Of course.
But first, I must read
these arguments, must I not?
Before coming to judgement.
His Majesty also
made it plain to us...
...that if you could not
give him satisfaction...
...then he must look
for a judgement elsewhere.
He might be forced to live outside
the laws of the Holy Church...
...and beyond
Your Holiness's authority.
My sons.
Boy?
Keep a look out.
My sons.
- Holy Father.
- Holy Father.
I fear you will be disappointed
in my answer.
I am unable to make a judgement,
here and today...
...concerning the king's case.
Wait, I have not said
it is the end of the matter.
I am resolved it should be settled
as soon as may be, but not here.
For you see how I am here.
So I am appointing Cardinal Campeggio
as my official legate.
Once the sickness
in your country abates...
...he will travel to England,
and together with Cardinal Wolsey...
...constitute a court to hear and decide
upon the merits of the case.
If your king is as certain
of his rightness as you say he is...
...then no doubt he will welcome
the proceedings...
...which can only hasten
the fulfilment of his desires.
Come.
Put them there.
Your Majesty should know...
...that, His Grace, the Duk e of Norfolk,
having caught the sweat...
...ask ed to be allowed back to London,
ostensibly to see a doctor.
This permission I refused
on Your Majesty's behalf.
Three of Your Majesty's apothecaries
have also fallen sick...
...while three of your chamber
servants have died.
Your mason Redman is also dead.
The disease shows
no sign of abating.
There are now 40, 000 cases
in London alone.
Lady Anne Boleyn is also sick,
yet still survives.
- Dr. Linacre.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Lady Anne is ill. Lady Anne Boleyn.
Go at once to Hever castle.
And for the love of God, save her life.
In my opinion, there is no hope.
The vital signs of life
are weak and worsening.
The priest should attend her now,
in extremis.
I'm very sorry.
- Are you not frightened, Papa?
- Of what? Of death?
No, no, no.
I have given myself entirely
into the hands of God...
...and I know with certainty
that when I die...
...I shall pass into
a far better place than this.
What you see around you
is not the fear of death...
...but the fear of what, for the
unrepentant, must surely follow it.
There is a spectre haunting Europe
which I fear far more than the sweat.
A sickness spreading everywhere.
Infecting thousands.
Of what do you speak, Papa?
The disease of Lutheranism.
It spreads among the poor.
Those who see the church
as rich and corrupt and decadent.
It has already ignited a peasants' war
in Germany and killed 100,000 people.
The contagion has spread...
...to Burgundy, Salzburg,
Montpellier and Nantes.
Every day brings more news
of the virulence of this heresy.
Surely it won't come here?
It is already here.
We know of secret meetings
here in the city of London...
...where the Church is attacked,
infamous books distributed.
Let me ask you, my child.
Let me ask you, what do you do...
...with a house which is plagued
with sickness?
You purge it with fire.
Exactly so.
In the same way, the sickness
which is in our house of faith...
...must be purged with fire.
Now, I am against violence,
as you know.
But I believe
that Luther and his followers...
...should be seized right now.
And burned.
Your Majesty, multitudes
are dying around us.
Almost everyone in Oxford, Cambridge,
and London has been ill recently.
Since the cardinal has also been ill,
and Your Majesty is gone from court...
...there is really no government
to the kingdom.
There have been
some riots in the city...
...but Your Majesty
should not be alarmed.
Sir.
- Come and see her.
- Get the master.
- My lord, my lord!
- Papa, come quickly.
George.
Praise be to God.
You know what you have done, child?
You have risen from the dead.
Now you can see the king again.
It can be just as before.
Thanks be to God,
my own darling, you are saved...
...and the plague is abated.
The legate which we most desire
arrived at Paris...
...on Sunday or Monday last.
I trust by next Monday
to hear of his arrival in Calais...
...and then I trust
within a while to enjoy...
...that which I have so longed for.
To God's pleasure and our own.
No more to you now, my darling,
for lack of time...
...but that I would you were
in my arms or I in yours...
...for I think it long
since I kissed you.
You have a letter
from Lady Anne Boleyn.
"My dear lord,
I am delighted to hear...
...that you have escaped the sweat.
All the days of my life,
I am most bound...
...of all creatures,
next to the king's grace...
...to love and serve Your Grace.
I beseech you never to doubt that
my opinion of you will ever change...
...as long as I have
any breath in my body.
Your humble servant, Anne Boleyn."
Well, at least she has
a sense of humour.
Joan.
Arrange for my pilgrimage
to Walsingham.
I must give thanks to our Lady.
Thank you. Thank you, God.
You think you know a story
but you only know how it ends.
To get to the heart of the story
you have to go back to the beginning.
Your Grace.
His Eminence, Cardinal Campeggio.
Lorenzo, my old friend.
My dear Wolsey.
Come.
Your Grace must forgive
my incapacity.
God has given me gout
as a great trial.
Now, His Majesty is very keen...
...that the legatine court
be set up straight away...
...to determine the case
for his annulment.
Indeed, indeed.
I have the pope's written commission
to decide upon this matter.
And from my decision,
there can be no appeal.
And yet...
If Your Grace has some water.
Water.
Mixed perhaps with a little wine.
And yet?
You and I are old friends.
And we are both men of the world,
Cardinal Wolsey.
I even have a son
who travels with me.
And so?
His Holiness wishes to satisfy the king,
however difficult that might be.
But for all our sakes,
would it not be better...
...if you and I were to try and persuade
His Majesty to give up his divorce?
Surely his passion for this girl
will alter and fade with time...
...as all such passions inevitably do.
I fear Your Eminence may have
proceeded here in ignorance.
Let me make certain things
plain to you.
If you do not grant the king
his divorce...
...papal authority in England
will be annihilated.
You should remember,
the greater part of Germany...
...has already become
estranged from Rome.
The same thing could happen here.
It would mean
the total ruin of the kingdom.
Is there any danger that they could
declare your marriage valid?
Wolsey has assured me that the pope
has already decided in my favour.
The trial's
just for the sake of appearances...
...a way of appeasing the emperor.
Then we can start planning
the wedding?
Yes.
Yes, my love.
Also for the sake of appearances,
there is something else.
For a while,
I shall have to share Catherine's table.
And sometimes her bed.
- Her bed?
- It's nothing.
My lawyers have just advised me that
to do otherwise might risk countersuit.
I could be seen to be acting
against her conjugal rights.
You think it's nothing
to go back to bed with your wife?
What do you think
is going to happen?
What usually happens.
How little you trust me.
I trust you.
I love you.
Catherine is not to blame for this.
Nor am I.
But the fact is, Excellence,
we broke God's law...
...for which there can be
no dispensation.
You understand how deeply
this touches my conscience...
...and how quickly
I need it to be resolved.
I do. I sympathise.
As does His Holiness, naturally.
But His Holiness also suggests
to Your Majesty...
...another possible solution.
I have already made it plain
to Your Eminence that His Majesty...
No, this is not the same, my friend.
This is a solution which should
very much please His Majesty.
What is it?
His Holiness is aware
of the queen's great piety.
She herself has spoken of it, her love
for the Mother of God, for the saints.
And he wonders if Her Majesty
might be persuaded...
...like Jeanne de Valois,
the sometime wife of Louis Xll...
...to abdicate her marriage...
...and retreat to a nunnery.
What do you think, Wolsey?
Well, it would certainly
expedite matters.
It would save us the pain of a trial.
And since it would be voluntary...
...it couldn't offend her nephew,
the emperor.
And moreover, it would afford
Her Majesty an honourable retirement.
You will put this to her right away.
Majesty.
Will Your Majesty
at least consider the proposal?
I will give you my answer
in due course...
...after I have spoken with the king,
my husband.
Father, will you hear
my confession later?
Yes, my child.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Eminence.
Your Majesty.
I beg that you yield to the king's will.
- And what is his will?
- As His Eminence proposes.
That you join a religious community
of your choosing...
...and take a vow
of perpetual chastity.
You speak to me of chastity?
Have you not a mistress
and two children, Your Eminence?
Your Majesty is entering
the third period of your natural life.
You spent the first two
setting a good example.
With this single act, you could
put the seal on all your good actions.
Please rise, Your Grace.
It is not seemly
for a man of your dignity...
...to be seen to beg in public,
whatever the cause.
Eminence.
- So you talked to Campeggio?
- Yes.
I told him I could not give an answer
without Your Majesty's permission.
And what answer will you give him?
- I will tell him the truth.
- Catherine.
All the world now agrees
that your marriage to me was unjust.
Even you must acknowledge it.
So unless you agree to take the veil,
I shall have to force you.
Do I have your permission
to talk to Campeggio?
I will not speak to him
if you do not want me to.
- My lady.
- Lady Anne.
Master Cromwell.
Do you have a message
from the king?
I think we understand each other.
A mutual friend, a Mr. Fish,
now living in exile in Holland...
...has sent me a gift for you.
What is it, Master Cromwell?
The Obedience of the Christian Man
by William Tyndale.
It contains many good criticisms
of the papacy...
...and of the arrogance
and abuses of priests.
You will find it most illuminating.
But always and ever be cautious
as to whom you show this.
You must know it might be
accounted heresy even to possess it.
And Wolsey is still keen enough
to prosecute heretics...
...as we are called,
who embrace the true religion.
I will.
And God bless you,
Master Cromwell.
Wait.
Please,
will you give this to the king?
With my love.
My lady.
Come here.
Chicken.
Chick...
Good chicken.
Don't run away.
Got you.
You never even told me your name.
- Jane.
- Jane.
Why did you leave the court?
When your sister died...
My sister is still here, Thomas Tallis.
She hasn't left me.
She can't leave me.
You can see her too, can't you?
I came all the way from London.
And I really want you
to come back to court.
Why?
You liked my sister more than me.
I could tell.
I want to marry you, Jane.
What is it you wish to confess?
Father, I wish to tell you about
my first marriage to Prince Arthur...
...His Majesty's older brother.
I know of it. Go on.
He never knew me.
I swear to you,
under the sacramental oath...
...I was intacta e incorrupta da lui
comme venne dal ventre di sua madra.
I want to be clear.
You say you were untouched
and unviolated by Prince Arthur...
...as when you came from the womb
of your mother?
Yes, Father.
So you came to the king's bed
a virgin, intacta e incorrupta?
Yes, Father.
Father, I say in all humility...
...I cannot accede to your request.
I am the true and legitimate wife
of His Majesty.
Therefore your proposal
is inadmissible.
Come what may...
...I will live and die
in that vocation to matrimony...
...to which God has called me.
I understand.
Furthermore, I give you permission
to break the seal of the confessional...
...and tell the whole world
what I have told you.
Henry wants you back at court.
You are his sister after all.
How can I return
while he flaunts himself with his slut?
I would be seen to be approving
of his ridiculous liaison.
Margaret, you and I must stay in the
king's good graces or we are nothing.
Let him marry who he wishes.
That was always your philosophy,
wasn't it, Charles?
So very cynical.
Is that why you keep company
with that devil Boleyn?
You liked him enough once
when he helped us back to court.
Or were you just being cynical?
I didn't see all of his game.
Now I do, I despise him.
So do I. But I hate Wolsey more.
- It's a marriage of expedience.
- Rather like ours?
No. I loved you.
You don't know
the meaning of the word.
You can love...
...perhaps for a year
or a month, a day...
...even for an hour.
And in that hour...
...I do believe you love
as well and deeply...
...as any man.
But after that hour, you love not.
You love another...
...and then another.
Your love...
...is most generous
where it is most hurtful.
- Margaret.
- Don't play the fool.
Doesn't become you.
Eminence.
I need to see Cardinal Campeggio.
Forgive me. My father is indisposed.
In any case, there is nothing further
he can do for the time being.
He has sent some reports to Rome...
...and must await the replies
from His Holiness.
And in the meantime...
...my poor father needs to rest
and restore his strength.
- Lady Anne.
- Good evening, Lady Anne Boleyn.
- There is the Mistress Boleyn?
- Yes, there she is.
The girl for whom the king...
...would sacrifice his marriage
to a most gracious and loving queen.
I have tried to argue him
out of his course.
But I swear that an angel descending
from heaven would not dissuade him.
Do you think they have taken things
to the ultimate conjunction?
I've received a petition from the dukes
of Suffolk, Norfolk and Lord Boleyn...
...saying the divorce has the support
of the people of England.
As Your Eminence
would quickly discover...
...if you stepped outside these doors
and saw the people...
...that is a manifest lie.
On the contrary,
the people love their queen.
And they have every reason
to do so.
If you'll excuse me.
- Wolsey.
- Her Majesty has refused the offer.
Are you surprised?
However, Campeggio tells me...
...that the pope is prepared
to consider legitimising any children...
...that you might have
with Mistress Boleyn...
...whether you are married or not.
Are you mad?
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.
Forgive me, Ambassador Mendoza.
I am new to this court.
Who are these men
talking with the king?
Lord Rochford is the father
of Anne Boleyn, Norfolk is her uncle.
Like the Duke of Suffolk,
they are Wolsey's sworn enemies...
...and everyone at court knows it.
They would stop at nothing
to bring him down.
Yet the king still loves him?
Not so much as before, perhaps.
But the cardinal
should never be underestimated.
May I know what you think
of the king's matter?
It is no secret
that the emperor is outraged...
...at the king's behaviour
toward the queen.
And I can tell you in strict confidence
that he has written to His Holiness...
...demanding that the matter be settled
in Rome, not here.
He would not seek to interfere
in any other way?
In what way?
Well, if the queen
were to be renounced...
...might he consider
military intervention on her behalf?
He has not said so.
- Has anyone asked him?
- No.
Not yet.
- Your Majesty.
- Margaret.
Not her. She's not worth it.
She's a cheap nothing.
Open your eyes. Look at her.
Look at yourself.
Look to your own marriage.
How are you?
Burning.
Burning with impatience.
My lady, Archbishop Warham...
...and Bishop Tunstall
are here to see you.
My lords.
I understand that you are among
my council for the legatine court.
As honourable men whose first duty
is to God and your conscience...
...you are welcome.
- Has the king sent you?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
We must discuss your brief.
I have nothing against His Majesty,
whom I love with all my being...
...only against his advisers...
...and a certain woman whose ambition
would ruin a kingdom.
Madam, we are not here
to discuss a brief or any such.
- But...
- We came here to report, madam...
...that rumours of plots against the life
of His Majesty are abroad.
And plots against
Cardinal Campeggio.
If any such plots
were to be successful...
...then clearly both you
and your daughter...
...would be suspected
of involvement.
I cannot believe the king
would give credence to such rumours...
...since he knows, as you know...
...that I value my husband's life
even much more than my own.
Madam,
there is yet another complaint.
That you are flippant and show yourself
too much to the people.
That you rejoice in their acclaim,
smiling, nodding and waving at them.
Therefore,
we suppose that you hate the king.
Why should you suppose that?
Because you don't accept that all this
time you've been living in sin with him.
Even when the truth has been revealed,
you refuse to accept the king's offer...
...offer to retire to a religious house.
That again.
I have answered for that already.
God never called me to a nunnery.
I am His Majesty's
true and legitimate wife.
- Madam, for the love of God...
- Yes, for the love of God.
As you yourself once professed,
archbishop.
You told people
that you knew my case to be true.
So, what changed your mind?
Was it Wolsey?
Tell me, do you prefer your place
in this earth...
...rather than your place in heaven?
- You have not answered the charges.
- Sir.
I consider it hard indeed to be charged
and accused by my own lawyers.
Where is the justice in that?
I will speak to you no more,
but you will not act for me.
Catherine.
Why do you go on
denying me justice?
You're so heartless.
So full of hatred.
I can't persuade myself any longer
that you love me.
I do love you.
I have never ceased to love you.
You know that.
I don't know it.
Perhaps you should be kept
away from our daughter...
...in case you start poisoning
her mind against me.
How can you say these things to me?
After all this time, after all
that we have meant to each other.
I'm only asking you to be reasonable.
I am being reasonable.
It is you who will not be reasonable.
What is it you really want, Thomas?
- Want?
- In life.
What do you want?
I don't know. Travel, I suppose.
Adventure, if I could.
Travel? Where would you go?
Have you not heard?
Sea discoverers
to new worlds have gone.
Cabot to Newfoundland,
others to America, the Indies.
Some speak of China, Cathay,
the fabled lands of Marco Polo.
But where would you go?
I'd set out here...
...though the hair is a forest
of ambush and snares.
But the brow becalms us
when it's smooth and plain.
And the dark pools of the eyes
are dangerous to our ship...
...for to be drawn into them
would be shipwreck.
The nose, like the first meridian,
directs us down...
...to the Islands Fortunate...
...the swelling lips.
I would anchor here...
...and hear the siren songs.
Then sailing on...
...past the glorious promontory
of chin.
We may encounter survivors...
...as we travel down
towards your India.
And we pause at the Atlantic navel.
Then the current carries our pilot on...
...to another forest...
...where many are shipwrecked...
...and no further ever get.
I have a new motto.
What is it?
You'll have to find it.
Where is it?
On a piece of ribbon
hidden somewhere.
Is it here?
No.
- Down there?
- No.
Is it down here?
I can't wait much longer.
You won't have to.
Your Majesty, there are fresh delays.
No one can see Campeggio.
Where is it? Tell me.
What if someone
is deliberately stalling?
Delaying things, making excuses.
Campeggio?
No. No, someone else,
someone much closer to you.
I'm touching it.
That's how it's going to be.
Let them grumble.
Someone much closer to you.
I want to ask you frankly
about Campeggio.
Do you trust him?
Do you think he's compromised?
Who knows, perhaps he's getting
a pension from the emperor.
As I know it,
Lorenzo is the least prejudicial of men.
And he has suffered personally
at the hands of Charles's soldiers.
When they entered Rome,
they ransacked his house.
I don't believe he has love
for the emperor.
Then why is he delaying the trial?
Well, there are some technical matters
that need to be resolved, that's all.
There is nothing for Your Majesty
to be concerned about.
Goddamn it.
It's not Campeggio at all, it's you.
You are the one delaying things.
You've gone cold on this divorce.
Perhaps you never believed in it.
You lied to me,
pretending to be on my side.
Majesty, I swear before you
and before God on my honour...
...I am your most humble servant.
And there is nothing on earth I covet
so much as advancing your divorce.
And to bring it to pass
is my continual study...
...and my most ardent desire...
...for which I am ready to expend
my life and my body and my blood...
...so help me God.
Come, Your Grace.
Don't be so dismayed.
You understand my impatience.
I know it's not you.
I trust you.
I've known you a long time.
Come, let's talk of other things.
By God's body, Master More.
The anger of the prince
means death.
Majesty.
I want you to go to Rome,
Mr. Cromwell.
I want you to force
His fucking Holiness into submission.
If necessary, telling him that
if he does not grant me my annulment...
...England will withdraw
its submission to Rome...
...and I will withdraw
my allegiance to him.
And make sure he knows
this is no idle threat.
I mean it and I will do it
if he does not satisfy me.
Send in the Duke of Suffolk.
My Lord Duke,
the king summons you.
Charles.
I have a task for you.
I want you to go to Paris
and seek out King Francis.
Question him closely
about Campeggio.
Ask him what kind of dealings he's had
with him, what kind of man he is.
Is he honest? Does he have
any ambitions to be pope?
And ask him, does he have
any secret dealings with the emperor?
I'll leave at once.
And, Charles...
...ask him about Wolsey.
I want to know everything
he knows about him.
You understand?
I want to know
whose side Wolsey's on.
Sir Thomas.
Most gracious sovereign lady.
I have brought Bishop Fisher
to see you.
I believe he can offer you
true and devoted counsel.
Thank you, Sir Thomas.
Majesty.
Please.
Lord Bishop, are you certain
that you wish to act for me?
You must be aware of the dangers
and difficulties you may face.
I would understand if you
would prefer peace and tranquillity.
Gentle madam, what peace
or tranquillity can there be...
...without justice
and the love of God?
I have studied the case against you
very carefully.
They will no doubt press the fact
that the pope's dispensation...
...to allow you to marry the king
was technically faulty...
...and therefore invalid.
But the obvious way of resolving
any such technical deficiency...
...is not to declare
the marriage null and void...
...but to issue fresh
and more perfect dispensation.
In any case,
the continuance of so long space...
...has rendered the marriage honest.
And the principle
of supplet ecclesia...
...let the church provide.
...has itself made good
any defects in the pope's dispensation.
Then you suppose we may win?
We may win the argument, yes.
But I cannot pretend
that it will avail us much.
We shall still try.
Be of good cheer, madam...
...for we are on the side
of the angels.
Hearts are trumps.
What is it?
I've heard from Cromwell.
He was eventually allowed access
to the pope but wrote in desperation.
Why?
He doesn't believe Clement
will do anything for me.
He said, " It might be in his paternoster,
but it's nothing in his creed."
The pope might pray
for me to solve my problems.
But he won't personally commit
to doing anything about it.
Show.
Show me.
We entertained the pope as he passed.
And I spoke personally to Campeggio.
He was very careful.
But even in the few words he spoke,
I thought he dissembled.
In what way dissembled?
I think he shows one face
but conceals another.
He has been asked to deal
with a matter he secretly despises.
So my advice to the king,
my brother...
...is to not put too much trust
in any man...
...in case he should be deceived.
And would you say the same
of Cardinal Wolsey?
I have nothing against His Eminence.
Of course not.
But what do you think
his attitude is towards the divorce?
As I could tell,
he wanted the divorce to go through...
...because he has no love
for the queen.
At the same time...
At the same time?
It is my impression that he has
marvellous intelligence with the pope.
They understand each other.
And also with Cardinal Campeggio.
Therefore, if he has
such understanding with them...
...and they are not minded
to advance the matter...
...then, to speak frankly to you...
...I think the king should take
a closer interest in it himself.
That is my advice.
Majesty.
Where is he going?
I'm sure to service
his latest mistress.
Now, why would he have to do that
when he has such a beautiful wife?
You should ask him, monsieur.
Don't you ever want
to pay him back?
Of course, always. I'm a woman.
Then go to bed with me.
If you like.
But tell me first...
...how is your beautiful wife?
- She's...
- She is just like me, non?
You have affairs and she ignores it.
To make love for revenge or pain,
what is that?
It hurts the mind.
And the soul, it shrinks.
The soul grows smaller.
And perhaps it even dies.
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.
Leave us.
The trial is coming.
Indeed, Your Grace.
I want to make it plain to you again.
If you refuse to grant the divorce...
...you will provoke a marvellous
opinion against the pope...
...against the papal courts,
and against the papacy itself.
I am obliged to the Holy Father
to seek truth and justice in this matter.
And that, Your Grace,
I will attempt to do...
...as God is my witness.
You still do not seem to understand.
So let me spell it out for you.
If you fail to find
in favour of the king...
...you will lose the king...
...and the devotion
of his realm to Rome.
And you will also utterly destroy me.
And that I cannot allow.
I totally understand.
You must have faith,
Cardinal Wolsey.
God help me.
My lords, it has become obvious
that Wolsey is severely compromised...
...and no longer enjoys the affinity
he used to share with His Majesty.
The king is suspicious
of his first minister.
And we should encourage
those suspicions.
It is time to bring him down.
Here is a pamphlet.
You see, it mocks his period in office
as a time of pride, waste...
...repression and ineffectual policies.
It's ready for distribution.
We shall call for the arrest
of Wolsey and his agents...
...the impounding of their papers
and a thorough examination...
...of his administration.
His corruption will be exposed
and treason guaranteed.
All that remains, Boleyn, is for your
daughter to prove to the king...
...that all his suspicions
are justified.
And then the cardinal
will be naked to his enemies.
- To England.
- To England.
- Christ.
- Sorry, sir. Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- Stupid dog!
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
I declare this legatine court...
...commissioned by His Holiness,
Pope Clement, is now in session.
And all that is said here
is said under oath...
...and in the presence
of God Almighty.
I call upon His Majesty
to speak first as to this matter.
Your Eminences know well
what cause I have to be here.
It concerns some scruples I have
regarding my marriage...
...which prick my conscience.
I have consulted widely
to discover the truth.
And I have read in Leviticus
that it was against God's law...
...and a sin,
for me to marry my brother's wife.
Your Eminences...
...I am not the only one who questions
the validity of my marriage.
All of my bishops share my doubts...
...and they have signed a petition
to put the matter to question.
My Lords, I tell you now...
...I never signed my name
to any such document.
- And if it appears there...
- Court has not invited you to speak.
If it appears there,
then Bishop Tunstall wrote it...
...without my consent.
The king has the floor. Sit down, sir.
- Sit.
- I'm not going to argue with you now.
After all, you are but one man.
As for the main issue...
...if I am asked why I waited so long
to bring this question to trial...
...I shall answer truthfully.
That it was the great love
that I bore for Her Majesty...
...which prevented me doing so.
It is I, myself,
who bear all responsibility...
...for my conscience which troubles
and doubts me.
Gentlemen of the court...
...I ask for one thing
and one thing only.
Justice.
In a moment, the court will call upon
the queen's majesty...
...to reply to the king's statement.
But first, I must tell the court...
...that the queen has sought,
through her advisers...
...to question the competence
of this court to try her case.
Further, she questions
the impartiality of her judges.
Finally, she contends
that this matter is in the hands...
...of a higher authority,
namely the pope...
...and therefore
can only be tried in Rome.
Now, as for the first matter.
Cardinal Campeggio and I
can confirm...
...that we have the necessary
authorization from His Holiness...
...to try this matter here.
Further, we reject any notion
of prejudice on our part...
...and will continue to try the case here
as we have been appointed.
So I call upon Her Majesty,
Queen Catherine, to address the court.
My lord.
Sir.
I beseech you...
...for all the love
that has been between us...
...let me have justice and right.
Give me some pity and compassion,
for I am a poor woman and a stranger...
...born out of your dominion.
I have no friend here
and little counsel.
I flee to you,
as head of justice in this realm.
I call God and all the world
to witness...
...that I have been to you
a true, humble and obedient wife...
...ever comfortable to your will
and pleasure.
I have loved all those
whom you have loved, for your sake.
Whether or not I had cause...
...whether they be my friends
or enemies.
By me,
you have had many children...
...although it has pleased God
to call them from this world.
But when you had me at first...
...I take God as my judge...
...I was a true maid
without touch of man.
And whether or not it be true...
...I put it to your conscience.
- Now, what is she doing?
- Shame.
Catherine, queen of England,
come back into the court.
Come back into the court.
Perhaps Your Majesty
should turn back. You are being called.
This court has no meaning for me.
Therefore, I will not stay here.
Catherine, queen of England...
...come back into the court.
She spits in the face of papal law.
She holds this court in contempt.
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.
My lords.
In the absence
of the queen herself...
...whom this tribunal
has pronounced contumacious...
...since she does not appear
when summoned.
We are trying to determine
whether or not...
...her first marriage
to Prince Arthur...
...was in fact
consummated in carnal copula.
We call a witness.
Sir Anthony Willoughby.
I understand you were in the escort
taking Prince Arthur to the nuptial bed?
I was, sir. My father was at the time
steward of the king's household.
So, I was present when the prince was
inserted into Lady Catherine's bed...
...and also
when he woke in the morning.
And did the prince say anything to you
when you saw him in the morning?
Yes, sir.
He said, "Willoughby, I'm thirsty.
Bring me a cup of ale.
Last night, I was in the midst of Spain."
Silence. Silence in the court.
- Anything else?
- Yes, sir.
Later that day he said to us, " Masters,
it's a good pastime to have a wife."
Silence in the court.
I believe we may have the bloodstained
sheets to corroborate my lord's story.
That would be most useful,
Your Eminence. Most useful.
- Your Majesty.
- Gentlemen.
The king asks
why you are not in court.
I have given answer to that already.
- Could we go somewhere private?
- Why?
I have nothing to hide.
Let my ladies and the whole world
hear what you have to say.
The king commands that you surrender
this whole matter into his hands.
Otherwise, the court
will condemn you.
I am surprised to receive
such a request...
...from such wise
and noble men as you.
I am but a poor woman,
lacking both in wit and understanding.
How am I supposed to respond to
a request made to me out of the blue?
You know perfectly what the king
desires and what he shall have.
All I know, Eminence, is that you...
...for your own purposes,
have kindled this fire.
All this time, all these years...
...I have wondered at your high pride
and your vain glory.
I have abhorred your voluptuous life
and had no regard...
...for your presumptuous power
and your tyranny.
I know also of your malice
against my nephew, the emperor.
You hate him like a scorpion.
And why?
Because he would not satisfy your
ambition and make you pope by force.
You should never presume to know...
My only satisfaction
is that in frustrating you...
...I hasten your fall
from the king's good graces.
An outcome I desire
above all others.
Hold, Your Eminence.
You will not get your divorce this way.
It is the only way.
Friend, give me a drink. I'm thirsty.
And if you'd all been to Spain as many
times as I went there last night...
...you'd all be fucking thirsty too.
In and out, in and out, in and out.
And I'll tell you this, lads.
First time I lay with a lady
I was but a chit of a lad.
So high to a grasshopper, I was.
I poked her all night.
A toast, I say a toast.
To Queen Catherine.
Who doesn't give a fig.
- God bless her.
- To the queen of England!
His Majesty, the king.
- My lords.
- Your Majesty.
You look splendid.
So my sources have just told me
that the emperor believes...
...Wolsey is to blame
for instigating the divorce.
He believes that the people of England
will soon rise up...
...and bring that creature
to the scaffold.
His end is surely approaching.
After which, Your Grace
will be the first man at court.
As you ought to be.
In which case, Boleyn...
...I shall not fail to promote
your family's interests.
It's true you have risen high.
But you shall rise higher yet.
Did you see?
They were all looking at you.
I'm glad. I want them to look at you.
I want them to be envious.
I want all of them to know
exactly how much I love you.
Then like my family motto,
I am "the most happy."
- How did it go in court today?
- Well enough.
Yet Catherine refuses to attend.
It will make no difference.
Wolsey promises me
I will have a divorce by summer.
Promises are easy.
What if you don't?
Margaret, what is it?
I couldn't sleep.
Come back to bed. It's cold.
Not yet.
I'm going to court tomorrow.
Will you come?
Your brother has asked again
for your presence.
I told you.
Not while he makes love in public
to that Boleyn girl.
It's offensive
and it makes him look like a fool.
Everyone else can see how proud
and grasping the Boleyns are.
- Why can't he?
- What if he commands you to come?
What is this?
Only a wife to a husband.
Sleep now, my sweet Charles.
I pray you, sleep.
Silence in the court.
In the absence of the queen,
we have been asked by her council...
...Bishop Fisher,
to make a statement to this court.
And being the circumstances...
...we have decided
that such a statement is admissible.
Your Grace.
Your Honours,
you have been asked to give verdict...
...on the validity
of the royal marriage.
Sirs, it is my contention that
this marriage of the king and queen...
...can be dissolved by no power,
human or divine.
Let me give, if I might,
a Biblical parallel.
You will remember, I am sure,
the tyrant Herod Antipas.
Who disembarrassed himself
of his wife.
In order that he might take
his brother's wife.
Damn you.
And who then executed
John the Baptist...
...when he dared to criticize
the royal couple.
Just as John the Baptist,
so I, in all humility...
...say to you here today
that I am ready to lay down my life.
To lay down my life...
...to defend the sanctity of marriage
and to condemn adultery.
Outrageous.
Your Honours.
I accuse this man, Bishop Fisher...
...of arrogance, temerity
and disloyalty.
I demand that you disregard
every vile word.
Thomas. Come in.
- Drink?
- Not for me, thank you.
No.
I have a mission for you, Thomas.
The French and lmperial forces
have ceased their aggression.
There is to be some sort of conference
at a place called Cambria, in France...
...between their negotiators and also
with representatives of the pope.
I, of course, am unable to attend.
Now the vital thing, Thomas...
...is that there be no agreement
between the other two parties.
I have had private reassurances
from the king of France...
Who is, after all, our ally.
- That he will never make peace with
the emperor, under any circumstances.
Similarly, there must there be
no rapprochement...
...between the Holy Father
and the emperor.
You must understand
under those circumstances...
...it would be impossible for the pope
to grant the king his desire.
- Yes, I do understand.
- Now...
You have your principles,
I understand that.
But for the love we both have
for the king...
...your job at Cambria
is to be as obstructive as possible.
Don't let Francis renege
on his commitments to us.
And don't let the pope forget
that it was Charles' forces...
...that invaded and sacked Rome.
And there is one other thing.
More than this?
Try to discover, by subtle means,
through his agents...
...if the emperor is prepared
to support his aunt by use of force.
You think he might invade England
in support of the queen?
I don't think anything.
But I imagine everything.
And it is those imaginings
that cause me great pain, Thomas.
Great pain.
But then wasn't it you that said:
"No man can expect to go to heaven
on a feather bed."
Have you no kind things to say?
- Kind?
- To your wife.
The mother of your child.
You treat me so unkindly.
And in public, neglect me.
Catherine,
you must accept the inevitable.
The weight of academic opinion
is against us.
We were never legally man and wife.
And the court will decide in my favour.
And if the court does not decide
in my favour...
...I shall denounce the pope as
a heretic and marry whom I please.
Sweetheart.
By all the angels,
I was intact when I came to your bed.
All right.
So you were a fucking virgin!
That's not the point.
Did I not tell you that if you argued
with her she'd have the upper hand?
I see now, one morning you'll succumb
to her reasoning and cast me off!
What do you mean?
- Anne, I love you.
- Let me go, let me go.
Why don't you see?
Why can't you understand?
I've been waiting for so long.
For what?
I could have contracted
some advantageous marriage...
...and borne sons which is a woman's
greatest consolation in this life.
Instead, I've been wasting my time
and my youth. For no purpose at all.
Anne, stop this.
You will have sons.
We will have sons.
No, no. It's too late.
Your wife won't let you go.
I should have realized.
- Where are you going?
- Home.
Stay here, I beg you. Anne.
I'm the king of England!
Make way for His Grace. Make way.
Your Eminence.
- An urgent message from the pope.
- Thank you, kind sir.
Look.
He is always leaning on someone.
Perhaps
someone should lean on him.
Perhaps.
- Your Eminence.
- Your Majesty.
- I trust we will soon have a verdict.
- Indeed.
We hear with great distress
of events in Germany.
- The destruction of the churches.
- Melancholy events, Majesty.
But why is it happening?
Majesty?
I'll tell you.
The Lutherans attack what they see
as the wickedness of Rome.
They believe
corruption is rewarded...
...but the faithful are abandoned
and badly treated.
I am a man of faith, Your Eminence.
God forbid His Holiness
should ever turn his back on me.
Alas, my love, you do me wrong
To treat me so discourteously
Don't you ever get tired of it,
Charles?
Of course. Then I go to sleep.
I bet you dream of women too.
No, I dream of God.
Of heaven and hell and of repentance.
Since you asked.
What are you thinking, Anthony?
I'm listening to that song,
and I'm thinking, omnia vincit amor.
No one can resist love.
- My lord.
- Your Majesty.
Please ask Anne to come back to court.
I beg you for my sake.
I can't live without her.
Tomorrow I shall have my verdict
and I shall be free.
Majesty.
Eminences, in accordance with
the rules and laws of this tribunal...
...and the wishes of His Majesty.
I ask you officially
to deliver your judgement.
Your Majesty, my lords.
After much deliberation,
we have decided...
...that this great matter is too important
to be here decided...
...without consultation
with the curia at Rome.
Unfortunately,
the curia is now in summer recess.
In which case,
there is no alternative...
...but to prorogue this tribunal
until October 1 st.
That is our judgement.
You stupid cunt.
It's never been good to be in England
while we have cardinals among us!
Are you so dense
that you really think this is my doing?
And of all people, you have the least
cause to be offended by cardinals.
If it wasn't for me, a simple cardinal,
sometimes having praised you...
...you would no longer have
a head on your shoulders.
Happy day.
Indeed, Senor Mendoza.
Campeggio received secret
instructions from His Holiness...
...who has advocated the matter
back to Rome.
I was not abandoned.
The emperor worked tirelessly
for your cause.
It is true you are leaving?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Ambassador Chapuys
will replace me.
I know him.
He's a most trustworthy person...
...and will take up your defence
with fidelity and diligence.
As you have done, Senor Mendoza.
In memory of me.
Majesty.
Thomas, how very good to see you.
How is the king?
The king is going on a progress.
Immediately.
With the Lady Anne.
I see.
Tell His Majesty that I am
handing over to him at once...
...the entire revenues
of the see of Durham.
It is one of the richest in England.
And tell him I shall not cease to work
for his great matter.
Campeggio and I will gladly accomplish
his lawful desire. Do you see?
- I shall tell him.
- And Thomas...
Tell me I can trust you
to advocate my interests to the king.
You may.
For without you, I would be
a lowly clerk, without profit or future.
I owe you my life.
I've been summoned to Rome.
I have to appear before the pope
and answer for myself.
Can you imagine it?
Me, the king of England,
who answers to no authority, but God!
Damn Wolsey. Damn him to hell.
- May I speak plainly?
- Yes, of course.
There are some who on good authority
care not for popes.
These writers say that the king...
...is both emperor and pope
absolutely in his own kingdom.
Which writers?
I have a book to show you,
with your permission?
Show it to me.
Softly love and to love softly.
Dew on the sycamore branch.
By the creaking gate.
Where my heart hurries afterwards.
Through the path of wheat,
along the briar, to that stone.
Under which I lie.
- Thank you for the audience.
- Very well, my lords.
- Your Majesty.
- Majesty.
Lord Rochford?
Majesty, the new lmperial Ambassador,
Mr. Chapuys...
...asks permission to present
his credentials to the queen.
Granted.
My lord, is there anything else?
Your Majesty, Cardinal Campeggio
is returning to Rome...
...and would like to take
his formal leave of Your Majesty.
Very well.
Mr. Cromwell,
invite him here to Grafton House.
Also Wolsey. Anything else?
Your Grace?
Majesty, forgive me.
Margaret is dead.
She died of consumption.
You never even told me
she was sick.
If that's the king's sister,
why isn't the king here?
- The king cannot go to funerals.
- Why?
No one is allowed
to imagine the death of the king.
For that would be treason.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
Come, come, Thomas.
Tell me what happened.
I take it you arrived at Cambria
on time?
Not exactly. We were a week late.
A week?
Then how could you have contributed
to the substantive arguments?
No, we couldn't. We weren't privy
to the main discussions.
We were only able to enter into
negotiations with the major parties.
What negotiations?
Well, I'm happy to report
that we secured a return...
...to mutually beneficial
trade relations...
...between ourselves
and the Low Countries.
We also obtained guarantees
regarding long-standing payments...
...owing to the king by the emperor.
But the major disputes, Thomas.
The major disputes!
What happened? Did the king
of France refuse to make peace?
No.
No, on the contrary, he settled
all his differences with the emperor.
Both of them settled their differences
with His Holiness Pope Clement.
In other words,
we were deliberately sidelined.
If you choose to put it like that.
Now there is no chance that the pope
will give the king his divorce.
Tell me, Thomas.
What exactly do you think
you might have achieved at Cambria...
...that makes you look so smug?
With respect, Your Eminence...
...to some degree
it wasn't for me to achieve anything.
Yet I consider this diplomacy
to be somewhat successful.
Once more, there is peace in Europe.
England is at peace with the empire.
More importantly, papal authority
is restored and recognized.
That is what I believe in.
- Francis betrayed me.
- Francis saw the futility of war.
He recognized the need for tradition.
And you, Thomas...
...you have destroyed me.
Make way.
This way, Your Excellency.
Your Honour's chamber.
Thank you.
Wait. Wait.
Where is my chamber?
There is none prepared for you,
Your Eminence.
I must change
from my riding clothes.
Then you had best ask elsewhere.
Your Eminence.
- Mr. Norris.
- Use my room.
It's not much, but...
I'll have your trunk sent up.
When you've changed,
you are to go to the presence chamber.
I am very grateful to you, Norris.
There are many here, sir,
who have cause to be grateful to you.
Though alas, they do not show it.
Cardinals Wolsey and Campeggio.
I hear you have been unwell.
Is it true?
Majesty, when was I ever
unwell enough not to serve you?
That's what I thought.
They tell such lies, these people.
Who can I trust?
We've come a long way together,
you and I, cardinal.
Did you think I'd forget?
And there is still
a great deal more to do.
I know, I know.
Don't be afraid.
We shall talk properly tomorrow.
Good morning, sweetheart.
Halt!
Stand aside,
I must speak with the king.
Stand aside.
Your Majesty.
Majesty! Your Majesty!
Majesty!
Majesty!
Majesty!
Ambassador Chapuys.
Your Majesty.
I have come at the king's invitation...
...to present my credentials
from the emperor.
Please.
I am glad to see you.
You know your mission has fallen
at a complicated time.
Indeed. I see my mission, madame,
as one of toute douceur.
All sweetness.
May I ask Your Highness
if I should now, at once...
...also present my credentials
to His Eminence, Cardinal Wolsey?
I do not see
that there is such a need as before.
The cardinal is somewhat undone.
He has been refused permission
to attend court.
- Then who should I attend instead?
- Norfolk, Suffolk and Rochford.
They are now closest to the king,
and carry out his affairs.
Seek them out,
if you would know things.
You should also know, ambassador,
that they are not great friends of mine.
Any of them.
In fact, better to say,
they are all my mortal enemies.
Make way.
Cardinal Wolsey,
you are here charged with praemunire.
That is exercising your powers
of papal legate in the king's realm.
Thus derogating
the king's lawful authority.
You are to be dismissed
of all your offices.
And all your goods shall be taken
to the king's hands.
I take it you have the king's
written authority for this?
You are commanded to relinquish
the great seal of your office.
- And where am I to go?
- To the king's house at Jericho.
To await the verdict of the court.
Make way for His Lord's Grace there.
How about a blessing now,
Your Eminence?
My own eternally beloved Cromwell.
I beseech you, as you love me
and will ever do anything for me...
...come here today,
as soon as your work is finished...
...and forgetting everything else.
I would not only communicate things
to you for my own comfort and relief...
...but would also have your good, sad,
discreet advice and counsel.
In haste, this Saturday...
...with the rude hand and sorrowful
heart of your assured who loves you.
Wolsey.
Wolsey pleaded guilty
to all the charges made against him.
Yes, I heard.
And sentenced to prison.
I have rescinded his punishment.
I've even agreed
to let him keep the Bishopric of York.
With a pension of 3000 angels.
You see what kind of monster I am?
I need to appoint a new chancellor.
Someone I can trust.
You're trained as a lawyer
and in royal service.
You have international prestige.
The friend of Erasmus,
the greatest humanist in all England.
- You have a fine, sharp mind.
- No.
- No what?
- No, I don't want to be Chancellor.
You will do as I command!
Listen, Thomas. I know you have
scruples concerning my divorce.
And I swear to you,
it will only be dealt with...
...by those whose consciences
agree with it.
I'll only use you for other things...
...and I will never let it
molest your conscience.
Look, Tom.
I want you, nay, I command you,
in all the things that you do...
...to look to God first,
and only then to me.
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.
His Majesty, the king.
My lords and councillors,
there is a great deal of work to do.
In the past, those who held
the reins of government deceived me.
Many things were done
without my knowledge or my approval.
But such proceedings
will stop in the future.
Your Grace will be appointed
president of the council.
Jointly with the Duke of Suffolk.
Your Majesty.
We shall convene again very shortly.
To discuss those matters
which remain close to our hearts.
A word.
Although it pleases me much...
...that Wolsey is no longer here
among us, yet...
Even in his absence,
does he not cause you disquiet?
How so?
He was attaindered,
but not for treason.
Which means he still lives.
And so long as he lives, he remains
a danger both to the realm and to us.
He is far away in York. In disgrace.
I think you exaggerate the danger.
And I think
that you don't understand it.
The king, as you know,
could easily change his mind.
And if he did,
if Wolsey ever returned to this court...
...we would both have cause enough
to fear his vengeance.
This is intolerable.
We must have the roof mended.
With what and by whom?
We have no money
and no bloody servants.
Surely, the king never meant you
to live so wretchedly?
After all,
you are still archbishop of York.
Well,
perhaps it's not the king's fault.
I have had cause
to remember the old prophecy:
"When the cow rideth the bull,
then, priest, beware thy skull."
You mean that cow Anne Boleyn?
Indeed so.
Which is why I'm writing her
this letter.
Even if she's the cause
of all our misery?
Well, yes, since she's the cause,
she can also be the cure.
I just have to persuade her
that I am not her enemy, but her friend.
I still have the letter in which
she promises to reward me...
...for all my pains and efforts
at such time as she becomes crowned.
I seem to remember at the time...
...you thought her promises
rather amusing.
Well, yes, perhaps I did.
Since then
I have rather lost my sense of humour.
Sir Thomas, I notice you allow yourself
none of the trappings of your office.
I'm not so vain as to display its power,
Master Cromwell.
But I tell you this,
I fully intend to use it.
- May I ask to what effect?
- Here, for example.
Here is a report of a sermon
recently given in Cambridge...
...by a certain Hugh Latimer.
A senior member of the university.
And I quote:
"Mr. Latimer said that holy scripture
should be read in the English tongue...
...of all Christian people
whether priest or layman.
He raged against
the gilding of images...
...the running of pilgrimages,
and superstitious devotion.
He said that all men were priests...
...and that we had no need
for priests or popes on Earth."
Times have changed,
Master Cromwell.
Now I plainly see the risk and danger
involved in such an open-door policy...
...towards these newfangled,
erroneous sects.
You condemn all Reformers
as heretics?
Wolsey was far too soft on them.
I intend not to be.
Will you burn them?
"This belief that pope and clergy
possess separate power...
...and authority
is contrary to scripture.
The king
is the representative of God on Earth...
...and his law is God's law.
The ruler
is accountable to God alone...
...and the obedience of his subjects
is an obedience required by God.
For the Church and the pope
to rule the princes of Europe...
...is not only a shame above all shames
but an inversion of the divine order.
One king and one law in God's name
in every realm."
This book is a book for me,
and for all kings.
And there are other books like it.
Books which detail
the abuses of power, privileges...
...the greed of the clergy
in Your Majesty's realm.
Books which Wolsey
deliberately kept hidden from you.
I should like to read them.
Now I've taken power unto myself...
...I shall work day and night
if necessary to resolve things.
Including my annulment.
I swear to you now
everything will be different.
His Majesty the king.
- Ambassador Chapuys.
- Your Majesty.
I hear you are a very able
and intelligent diplomat.
Like me, I'm sure you're aware
of all the new religious controversies.
I know of some new heresies that have
sprang up here and there, certainly.
If only the pope and his cardinals
could set aside their vain pomp...
...start living according to the precepts
of the gospels the and early fathers.
I am well aware Your Majesty...
...is in the midst of an argument
with His Holiness.
I'm not talking about myself.
You see, when Luther attacked
the vice...
...and corruption of the clergy,
he was right.
Had he stopped, and not gone on
to destroy the sacraments...
...and so on, I would have
raised my pen in his defence...
...rather than attacking him.
The need for reformation
in the Church is manifest.
The emperor has a duty to promote it.
As do I in my own domain.
I'm glad we've had this opportunity
to exchange opinions.
- Your Majesty.
- Ambassador.
- I'm surprised you have so much time.
- To do what?
- To do nothing.
- What are you saying?
Aren't you supposed to be
running the country?
I leave that to Norfolk.
He's had more practise.
In any case, meetings
with ambassadors, infinitely tedious.
They're all liars, hypocrites,
and middle-aged men.
Would you prefer them to be women?
My friend, if all ambassadors
were beautiful women...
...l'd be serving my country
day and night.
- Here we are.
- Your Grace.
Let me present my ward,
Miss Catherine Brooke.
- Sir Anthony Knivert.
- Miss Catherine.
- Sir.
- Anthony's one of our finest horsemen.
Except for when I fall off.
- You enjoying your walk?
- Yes.
Good.
Then I shan't delay you any further.
Put your back into it, lads.
- Pretty little thing, isn't she?
- Indeed, she is.
I'm gonna marry her.
You've been in exile, Mr. Fish?
Yes, sir.
It was Cardinal Wolsey's pleasure
to keep me in Holland...
...for fear I might speak the truth.
So why did you try to return?
I thought, sir, that with the cardinal
fallen and sent away...
...that circumstances in this country
might be changed for the better.
More tolerant.
Do you have friends in this country?
- Of course, sir, as an Englishman.
- At court?
Do you have friends at court?
Do you deny you are the author
of this work...
...A Supplication for the Beggars?
No, sir.
What is it?
Sir, an appeal to His Majesty...
...to redress many of the terrible
and scandalous abuses of the Church.
You seem to suggest
that the real aim of the Church...
...is to seize all power, lordship,
obedience and dignity from the king.
In fact, you go further.
You claim that the Church itself...
...is a source of rebellion
and disobedience against the king.
Don't you, Mr. Fish?
And here, Mr. Fish, if I may.
You say that the exactions
taken from the people...
...are not given
to a kind, temporal prince...
...but to
"a cruel, devilish bloodsucker...
...drunken in the blood
of the martyrs and saints of Christ."
Shame on you, Mr. Fish.
For who are
these cruel, devilish bloodsuckers...
...but the anointed priests
of our holy Church.
Those who show us
the way to heaven.
But then, you don't believe in that
either, do you, Mr. Fish?
Who are you?
I'm a Christian man,
the child of everlasting joy...
...through the merits
of the bitter passion of Christ.
This is the joyful answer.
It is also heresy.
What is it? What has she done?
She is wearing purple.
And purple is the colour of royalty.
You know, I sometimes wish...
...that all Spaniards
were at the bottom of the sea.
Mistress Boleyn...
...you should not abuse the queen's
honour with such language.
I care nothing for Catherine.
I would rather see her hanged
than acknowledge her as my mistress.
- Is that it?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Thank God.
What is it, Mr. Cromwell?
Your Majesty, I...
Mr. Cromwell.
I must beg Your Majesty's indulgence,
and forgiveness, before I...
Go on.
I had cause, recently,
on a visit to Waltham Abbey...
...to speak to a learned friend there.
We spoke about
Your Majesty's great matter.
We came to the conclusion
Your Majesty's advisers...
...might not, perhaps,
be approaching the matter...
...in the most convenient way
to solve it.
- You mean through the courts?
- Yes.
As Your Majesty well knows,
kings are set above the law.
They are answerable to God alone,
who anointed them.
So it seems to us that the matter is not,
and never has been, a legal one.
It is a theological one.
But in that case,
who should pass verdict upon it?
We would suggest...
...that Your Majesty
canvass the opinion of theologians...
...at colleges around Europe.
Their sentence
would be pronounced...
...and could be implemented
with little industry.
And by that simple measure...
...I trust that Your Majesty's
troubled conscience might be pacified.
Will you write a paper
showing your argument?
- Lf Your Majesty trusts me to do so.
- No, I command you to do so.
Then I command you,
as a royal agent...
...visit the universities in Europe.
I want the opinion of their theological
faculties as soon as possible.
Thank you, Mr. Cromwell.
There's still time
to recant of your heresy, Mr. Fish.
If you acknowledge that your opinions
were misguided, evil...
...contrary to the law of God...
...then you will be spared the
great pains you must otherwise endure.
I beg of you, acknowledge your sins.
God will welcome you back
into his fold.
Recant.
Recant, you still have a moment.
The Lord is my shepherd,
I can want nothing.
He feedeth me in green pastures,
he leadeth me to fresh waters.
Though I should walk now
in the valley of the shadow of death...
...yet I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.
Thy staff and thy sheep,
they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table for me,
against mine enemies.
My head Thou anoints with oil,
and filleth my cup full.
Oh, let thy loving-kindness and mercy
follow me all the days of my life...
...that I mayest dwell
in the Lord's house for ever.
I have something
I want to say to you.
I have decided
to ennoble you and your family.
You are to be created
Earl of Wiltshire and Ormonde...
...and I am also appointing you
Lord Privy Seal.
George will become Lord Rochford...
...and be made a member of council.
Your Majesty, I'm lost for words.
Your bounty is unceasing.
I also have high hopes
for Mr. Cromwell.
I'm glad. He is a friend of the family.
You know his thesis.
I want you to visit the pope
and the emperor at Bologna.
I want you to put to them
our new case.
Please tell me
you are not losing hope.
It is true, I...
I had always fancied that the king...
...after pursuing his course
for some time, would turn away...
...would yield to his conscience,
and change his purpose...
...as he has done so often before.
I believed with all my heart
that he would return to reason.
But now l...
Madam, I pray you. Don't give way.
No, Excellence.
I shall never give way.
Thank you for what you have done
for my father.
For my whole family.
There's more.
I've made alterations
to Wolsey's old palace at York Place.
You said you liked it.
I am giving it to you.
What is it?
Have I made you unhappy?
No.
I would only be unhappy
if you ever stopped loving me.
London would have to melt
into the Thames first.
It is everything now
for the lady Anne?
Sir Thomas, does this not remind you
of a wedding feast?
It seems to me that nothing is wanted
but a priest...
...to give away the nuptial rings
and pronounce the blessing.
God forbid that should happen.
It's none of my business.
My new job as chancellor...
...will be to do my utmost to contend
for the interests of Christendom.
Perhaps the king's Majesty...
...is more inclined
towards the Reformers than you know.
I don't think so.
I know him better than you do,
Excellence.
His deepest instincts
are traditional and faithful.
He may threaten
to break with Rome...
...but I don't think he will ever do so.
I hope you are right.
The consequences
would be unthinkable.
Everything seems to move
in your favour, Your Grace.
I have bad news.
I happen to know that the king...
...has sent Wolsey
an intaglio portrait of himself.
So?
So it is traditionally
a sign of goodwill.
It may presage a reconciliation.
A small gift to ease the king's
conscience is hardly a sign...
...that the bishop of York
will be restored to his former glory.
Think of it this way.
When Satan fell from heaven,
was he ever invited back?
You were.
I see that you have accepted patronage
from Mr. Cromwell, Mr. Wyatt.
How very transparent the world is.
But was I wrong to do so, Tallis?
I think so. Yeah.
You should be your own man.
Don't be a fool, Tallis. You won't
survive long in this slippery world...
...without the support of a great man.
You think Mr. Cromwell
is a great man?
No, I think he's a coming man.
Mark my words.
For what it's worth, I did fuck her.
What is it, Thomas?
I have had a reply to my letter.
From Mistress Boleyn?
What did she say?
That she will not speak to the king
on my behalf.
Then our hopes are over.
No. No, no.
I have resolved to write
to another lady...
...who is far greater, far greater
than that mischievous whore.
And far more likely to be kind.
Madam, the king is here.
Please. Be seated.
Majesty.
I came because I heard
you were unwell.
And that it was necessary
for the physician to have bled you.
- How are you feeling now?
- I am very well.
Your Majesty is kind
to show concern.
How is our daughter?
She writes to me in perfect Latin
and tells me she dances the galliards...
...and can play the lute much to
everyone's satisfaction and joy.
- You should be proud of her.
- I am proud of her.
You ought to invite her to court.
You could watch her
dancing and playing.
- It might please you.
- Catherine, l...
I hear that several of your agents...
...have been sent abroad to canvass
theological opinion about the divorce.
For every scholar
that votes for you...
...I could find a thousand
who would vote for me.
My lords...
...every day I'm forced to read
new reports of dissatisfaction...
...confusion and delays
throughout my kingdom.
My exchequer is empty...
...and we are borrowing money
at a biting rate.
Your Graces
are presidents of this council...
...and yet I hear nothing
from you on these matters.
Nor any other matter.
- Your Majesty must forgive me...
- Yes, I know. I must always forgive you.
But I grow tired of forgiving you!
I have given you everything, including
the right to call yourself prince!
And what do I get in return?
I used to think the cardinal vain,
self-serving and greedy...
...just as you told me.
But now I understand the burden
he carried, uncomplainingly.
Your Majesty should not forget
that he also stole from you...
...and he served the interests
of the French...
...even above those of England.
Is that what you think, Thomas?
It is certainly true that the cardinal
was vainglorious beyond measure.
It did him tremendous harm...
...and made him abuse
the considerable gifts God gave him.
And yet he is a better man
than any of you...
...for managing
this kingdom's matters.
- I will talk to him.
- Yes, you must.
Ambassador Chapuys, Your Majesty.
Ambassador.
- I have a letter for Your Majesty.
- From the emperor?
No. From Cardinal Wolsey.
This is so strange.
Do you know what it says?
The cardinal is offering
to create a rapprochement...
...between you and he,
the emperor, and Rome.
The coup would be signalled
by the arrival of a papal edict...
...ordering Henry to leave Anne Boleyn
and return to his marriage.
The emperor will offer
his financial and moral support...
...and insist that Wolsey be reinstated
as chancellor.
Do you think it could work?
The cardinal is nothing
if not ingenious.
I want you to set up
a new parliament.
Important things need to be done.
My exchequer is empty, for one thing.
I will do as Your Majesty commands.
But I must warn you
that you may not find this parliament...
...as compliant as those before.
How so?
Well, though I must confess
to being amongst those...
...who called for greater tolerance
and freedom of speech...
...I fear that the freedom so given
by Your Majesty's kindness...
...is now openly abused.
There are many dissenting voices
in the kingdom...
...chiefly on religious matters.
There are calls for a reformation.
How many have you burned,
Thomas?
Six.
All lawful,
necessary and well done.
Well done?
Yes, Harry.
What did he say?
Well, in so many words...
...he told me that he was inclined
to pardon Wolsey...
...and restore him to royal favour.
And what did you say?
I agreed with His Majesty
that the cardinal had many talents.
You did what?
I agreed with the king
that His Eminence had many talents.
I cannot believe this.
Have you not spoken yourself...
...of the terrible vengeance
he would exact on us...
...if he ever again had the power?
Or perhaps you don't think vengeance
to be one of his many talents.
I do indeed.
Which is why I cultivate
the king's good graces.
Your Majesty will be pleased to know
that the University of Paris...
...the greatest prize of all,
has declared in your favour.
And Italy?
I confess that the universities there
are divided.
But Padua, Florence and Venice
have all declared for Your Majesty.
Spain? Catherine's country?
Spain is against.
Are you surprised?
And you, my lord.
Did you get to see
the emperor and His Holiness?
How are they?
Your Majesty,
the emperor refused to see me.
And His Holiness?
The pope simply gave me this edict,
to bring to Your Majesty.
What does it say?
The edict instructs Your Majesty...
...to order Lady Anne Boleyn
to leave your court.
It refuses to allow
Your Majesty permission to remarry...
...while the papal curia
is deciding Your Majesty's case.
Mr. Wyatt.
- I am busy.
- There is someone you should see.
- Not now, Mr. Wyatt.
- It concerns the cardinal.
Your Excellency.
What can I do for you?
My Lord, I would ask you
a very great favour.
These are troubled times.
It seems to me
that in certain quarters...
...there is now a blatant
and open hostility to our holy Church.
- As we discovered in Germany...
- And what do you expect me to do?
I beg you to use the great influence
you have here at court...
...to pull England back from the brink
of catastrophe and ruin.
For the love we all bear
for Christ and his apostles.
What apostles?
I don't believe Christ had apostles,
not even Saint Peter.
Those men were all charlatans...
...who pretended to follow Christ
and speak in his name.
And they built a Church
upon their lies.
Mother of God.
Your Honour, Your Honour, so grateful.
Sir, this is Augustus de Augustinis.
A private physician
to Thomas Wolsey.
Wolsey?
What do you know about him?
Sir, I know that Wolsey sought the help
of the emperor and the p...
The pope?
- Yes, your honour...
...His Holiness the pope.
Against His Majesty.
- They communicated?
- Yes, yes, yes.
And who else?
Wolsey conspired
with Queen Catherine...
...because he said it was the only way
that he could be...
- Restored to power.
- Yes.
The king must know of this.
Now you know the truth,
you must act against him.
He and his fellow priests
and prelates...
...think they can control
Your Majesty's realm.
That they are higher than you.
And by taking instruction
from the pope...
...was not Wolsey acting
as an agent of a foreign country?
The presumption of the pope...
...thinking he could tell you,
you, what to do.
Wolsey, sir.
In the name of the king.
- Get up.
- Get out of bed.
- No, no.
- He's done nothing.
Thomas Wolsey, you are arrested
by order of the king...
...and charged with high treason.
You will be taken to London,
where you will be tried.
- There, there, Joan.
- Guards.
No tears.
No tears for me, I beg you.
Forgive me.
For you have not much
to remember me by.
No. I have a life and everything in it
to remember you by.
Guards, shackle him.
Well, well, Brandon.
If I had served God as diligently
as I served the king...
...he would not have given me up
in my grey hairs.
Move on.
Joan.
Joan.
I regret to have to inform
Your Majesty...
...that I can no longer continue
to serve the emperor at this court.
There is so much hatred here
for everything that is sacred and true...
...that those who speak brazenly of it
have driven me away.
You are not to blame.
You have always served me
with wisdom and kindness.
I will not forget it.
Send my love to my nephew.
I will inform His Highness
of your plight...
...and of the malice and unkindness
of His Majesty towards you.
Yes, tell him.
But this also, for the love I bear
this country as well as him.
He must not think to use force
against His Majesty or his people.
It would be a sin against
my conscience and against God.
Lord, we have not spoken
as long or as often as we should.
I have often been
about other business.
If I wanted forgiveness,
I should ask for it...
...but for all that I have done...
...and for all that I am yet to do,
there can be no forgiveness.
And yet, I think, I'm not an evil man.
Though evil men pray louder...
...and seek penance...
...and think themselves
closer to heaven than I am.
I shall not see its gates, Lord.
Nor hear
your sweet words of salvation.
I have seen eternity, I swear...
...but it was in a dream,
and in the morning all was gone.
I know myself for what I am.
And I throw my poor soul
upon your forgiveness...
...in the full knowledge
that I deserve none...
...at your loving hands.
Welcome to hell.
Mr. Cromwell.
Majesty...
Cardinal Wolsey is dead.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I wish he'd have lived.
How did he die?
Took his own life.
No one must ever know.
Do you understand?
No one. Never.
I'll finish my game, and we'll talk.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Sir Thomas, I have just heard.
By His Majesty's order,
15 senior clergymen...
...have been arrested
for recognising Wolsey's authority.
There is also a statute
before parliament...
...which recognizes in matters
temporal and spiritual...
...the king is above the law
and shall give account to God alone.
What can be done?
I am reminded of something
Wolsey once told me.
That I should only tell the king what
he ought to do not what he could do.
"For if the lion knows his own strength,
no man could control him."
We're standing
on the edge of the abyss.
God knows what shall become of us.
I want you.
- I'm gonna come.
- No, you mustn't.
Perhaps you could imagine a way
to keep his interest more prolonged?
Sa Majesté, le Roi !
Précédemment...
C'est conclu. Nous irons
en guerre contre la France.
À présent, je peux m'amuser.
<i>Sir Thomas More.</i>
- Votre Majesté.
- Vous n'avez rien dit au conseil.
- À quel sujet ?
- La guerre contre la France.
En tant qu'humaniste, je hais la guerre.
<i>En tant que Roi,
je ne suis pas d'accord.</i>
<i>Je dois absolument l'essayer.</i>
Cent couronnes si tu réussis.
Tenu !
Je te fais Duc... Duc de Suffolk.
- Cela vous plaît-il, Votre Grâce ?
<i>- Réjouissons-nous !</i>
Il n'a aucun droit sur cela.
<i>Je suis le descendant d'Édouard II.</i>
C'est ma couronne.
Halte là !
Je vous arrête
pour suspicion de trahison.
<i>Je n'ai pas d'héritier.
La lignée des Tudors,</i>
toute l'œuvre de mon père, anéantie.
Et c'est ma faute.
Vous ne visitez plus ma couche,
comme à l'accoutumée.
Les choses ne vont plus très bien,
entre Sa Majesté et moi.
<i>J'ai parfois l'impression
qu'il veut divorcer.</i>
<i>Un divorce ? C'est impossible...</i>
Vous croyez ?
Sa Majesté est las de votre sœur.
<i>Tant qu'elle était sa maîtresse,
notre fortune était faite.</i>
On dit que toutes
ses relations ne durent pas.
Il s'enflamme
puis se refroidit aussitôt.
<i>Vous pourriez imaginer un moyen</i>
<i>de maintenir son intérêt
plus... longtemps ?</i>
<i>Éveillez ses passions.</i>
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Anne Boleyn.
M. Wyatt, étiez-vous amoureux
d'Anne Boleyn ?
Je l'aimais, bien sûr, mais de loin.
Si vous tenez à la vie,
ne parlez de moi à personne.
Sachez que je vous désire
de tout mon cœur.
C'est votre devoir d'utiliser
son amour à notre avantage.
Non, pas de cette façon. Séduisez-moi !
<i>Je sais ce que vous faites.</i>
Mais ne pensez pas
éloigner le Roi de moi.
<i>Quand nous serons mariés,</i>
<i>je vous donnerai un fils.</i>
Tout ce que j'ai est à vous,
il suffit de demander.
Je veux divorcer
et à vous de l'obtenir.
Un divorce ?
Le peuple ne lui pardonnera jamais.
En ce qui me concerne,
notre mariage est à sa fin.
<i>Bientôt, il saura ce que vous êtes.</i>
<i>Et il se lassera de vous.</i>
Et si l'on n'y parvient pas ?
<i>Si elle parvient à son but...</i>
Elle plongera tout le pays
dans la terreur.
J'ai appelé à un conclave de cardinaux,
pour apporter un jugement final
sur l'annulation de votre mariage.
Assurez-vous qu'ils arrivent
à la bonne décision.
Dans ce cas, Votre Éminence,
votre but a dépassé votre pouvoir.
<i>Et si quelqu'un
nous volait sciemment ?</i>
<i>Retardant les choses,
inventant des excuses.</i>
Vous ne croyez plus à ce divorce.
Peut-être n'y avez-vous jamais cru.
<i>Vous m'avez menti, en
prétendant être de mon côté !</i>
Majesté !
Si vous n'êtes pas avec moi,
vous êtes contre moi.
Ne bougez plus ! Au nom du Roi !
Je vous arrête au nom du Roi,
pour haute trahison.
- Je ne veux pas être chancelier.
- Vous ferez ce que j'ordonne.
M. Cromwell est un grand homme.
Non, un homme émergeant.
Votre Majesté doit savoir que les Rois
sont au-dessus des lois.
Ils ne répondent qu'à Dieu seul,
qui les a consacrés.
Merci, M. Cromwell.
Je dénoncerai le Pape comme hérétique,
et j'épouserai qui je veux.
Si vous voulez qu'on dise que le Roi
ne tient pas sa parole, alors très bien.
Après tout, je reste le serviteur
de Votre Majesté.
Je vous jure que tout sera différent.
En enfer !
Je suis le Roi d'Angleterre !
Si le lion connaissait sa force...
nul homme ne pourrait le contrôler.
Et c'est ainsi, que tout a commencé.

LONDRES 1532
- Sir Thomas.
- Votre Grâce.
Votre Grâce.
Ambassadeur Chapuis.
Je pensais que vous
nous aviez abandonnés.
C'est vrai... Je l'ai fait.
J'ai essayé.
Mais, en toute conscience,
je n'abandonnerai pas Sa Majesté.
C'est la plus merveilleuse
femme au monde.
- Je serais bien ingrat.
- Je suis d'accord.
L'Empereur aussi.
Il a écrit cette lettre d'encouragement,
et de soutien,
pour vos efforts.
Je vous supplie de ne pas me la donner.
J'ai eu du mal
à prouver ma loyauté au Roi.
Aucun de mes actes
ne doit attirer le doute,
par les temps qui courent.
Je ne veux pas être privé de la liberté
nous permettant
de nous entretenir en privé
de ce problème qui concerne
votre maître et la Reine.
Je comprends.
Nul besoin d'explications.
Merci, M. Cromwell.
Majesté.
Sir Thomas More.
Cromwell...
Sir Thomas.
Majesté.
Je dois vous dire.
J'ai reçu une requête des membres
de la Chambres des Communes.
Se plaignant de la conduite
cruelle et abusive des prélats,
et du clergé.
Thomas...
Le peuple demande
à être libéré du joug du clergé.
Votre Majesté sait parfaitement
que j'ai toujours,
depuis ma naissance,
condamné les abus du clergé.
En tant que chancelier,
j'ai œuvré inlassablement
pour les éliminer et purifier
notre Sainte Église.
Mais...
Vous connaissez ma position.
Vous l'avez toujours su.
Je ne peux tolérer cette...
nouvelle vision de...
croyances secrètes
et de grâces personnelles.
Pour moi, l'Église est...
un signe vivant de la présence divine.
C'est une communauté
visible et concrète.
Et non une assemblée
complotant en secret.
Vous êtes donc contre moi.
Ma loyauté et mon affection
pour Votre Majesté sont telles
que je ne dirai rien
contre vous en public.
Et que Dieu me vienne en aide.
PARLEMENT WESTMINSTER
Levez-vous pour le Roi !
Majesté...
Milords, vos Grâces...
Nous sommes ici
pour connaitre votre réponse
aux accusations
dont vous faites l'objet.
Vous êtes accusés d'avoir soutenu
le pouvoir de feu le Cardinal Wolsey,
et de l'Évêque de Rome,
contre votre Roi
et votre pays.
Certains d'entre vous croient peut-être
que je recherche un intérêt personnel.
Ce n'est pas le cas.
En ma qualité de Roi,
j'ai mission de restaurer
l'ordre sur terre.
Et d'assurer l'immunité
et les principes de la liberté
de notre règne et de notre couronne.
Ceci est mon devoir sacré.
Établi devant Dieu,
et par un serment solennel,
lors de mon couronnement.
Quelles sont vos conclusions,
Archevêque Warham ?
Votre Majesté,
avant de vous les communiquer,
je laisse la parole à Sa Grâce,
le très estimé Évêque Fisher.
Évêque de Rochester.
Milords...
Nous sommes ici pour nommer Sa Majesté,
chef suprême de l'Église d'Angleterre.
Malheureusement, nous
ne pouvons accorder cela au Roi
sans abandonner notre unité
avec le Saint-Siège.
Si nous renonçons
à l'unité du monde chrétien,
et quittons la barque de Pierre,
nous serons alors entrainés dans
le tourbillon de l'hérésie, des sectes,
des schismes et des divisions.
Je vous le dis.
Si l'on accepte cette...
suprématie contre notre Sainte Église,
cela représentera le premier accroc
dans le manteau immaculé du Christ.
Vos Grâces !
Nous écouterons vos avis.
Cette proposition sera mise en débat.
Votre Majesté a un nouveau titre.
Chef suprême de l'Église
et du clergé d'Angleterre.
Mais je dois l'ajourner.
Aussi longtemps...
que la Loi du Christ l'autorise.
Ceux qui sont pour.
Parfait.
Ceux qui restent silencieux...
sont présumés consentants.
Merci, Votre Grâce.
- Cardinal Campeggio.
- Saint-Père.
Asseyez-vous Cardinal,
je sais que vous souffrez de la goutte.
Et mes pieds me font,
moi aussi, souffrir.
Pourquoi vouliez-vous me voir ?
Nous avons reçu deux nouvelles lettres
au sujet de l'affaire
du Roi d'Angleterre.
Encore...
Que disent-elles ?
La première est du Roi lui-même,
vous priant d'émettre
une décision ultime et favorable
à son annulation, pour le maintien
de la paix en Angleterre.
Il utilise un langage tempéré,
Votre Sainteté, se plaignant que :
"jamais un Prince
n'a été traité par un Pape,
"comme Votre Sainteté nous traite."
Il veut parler de mon prédécesseur,
et, honnêtement, il n'a pas tort.
Clément était incroyablement négligent.
Mais il est injuste
que certaines personnes
aient exhumé son cadavre
et qu'elles le poignardent dans la rue.
Je peux comprendre ce sentiment,
il n'a jamais été populaire.
"Requiescat in pace."
Et la deuxième lettre ?
De l'Empereur,
pour le compte de sa tante.
Catherine, la malheureuse Reine,
vous exhorte à éviter l'annulation,
et à excommunier le Roi.
Il est vrai que nous devons
parvenir à une décision.
D'un autre côté...
Dans l'intérêt de l'Église,
nous tenterons
de ne pas favoriser
une partie plutôt que l'autre.
Car après tout, ils ont
des soldats et des armes,
alors que nous œuvrons
avec notre foi et la vérité.
À propos de cette catin,
la pute du Roi ?
Anne Boleyn.
Pourquoi personne
ne nous en a débarrassés ?
Non.
Ne vous levez pas.
Ne bougez pas.
Vous êtes si belle.
Si désirable.
Je vous veux totalement mienne.
Je ne peux plus attendre.
Oh, mon amour.
Patientez encore un peu...
Ensuite...
J'ai été fait chef
de l'Église d'Angleterre.
Est-ce vrai ?
Je suis extrêmement... heureuse.
Enfin, vous avez eu vos droits.
Et vous pouvez agir selon vos désirs.
Je vais ordonner à Cromwell
de préparer les appartements de la tour.
Toutes les Reines d'Angleterre
y ont séjourné...
avant leur couronnement.
Papa...
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Je vous voyais vous réjouir.
C'est trop tôt pour cela.
Les Évêques n'ont pas dit
leurs derniers mots.
Par défaut, ils ont fait du Roi,
chef de l'Église,
mais tant que
la Loi du Christ le permet.
Nul besoin d'être avocat,
pour savoir que la Loi du Christ
peut être utilisée pour
invalider cette décision.
Et tout cela n'aura servi à rien.
Non.
Pas du tout.
Le principe est maintenant
admis par la majorité d'entre eux.
Et George m'a dit que la résistance
est entre les mains d'un seul homme.
- Le damné Évêque Fisher.
- Fisher.
Monsieur...
Ah, Monsieur Cranmer.
Désolé pour mon retard, M. Cromwell.
Je suis impardonnable.
Nous venons de commencer à dîner.
Je suis content de vous voir.
M. Boleyn, M. Wyatt,
je vous présente M. Cranmer.
M. Cranmer, vous êtes
un homme du clergé.
Et vous, un poète, M. Wyatt.
C'est le plus petit de mes talents.
- J'aimerai me confesser, après diner.
- À votre place, je refuserai.
Nous parlions avant votre venue,
des progrès de l'assemblée des Évêques,
devant statuer sur la suprématie du Roi.
Sa Majesté a sagement décidé
de nommer George Boleyn,
négociateur auprès de Leurs Grâces.
Ils sont, pour la plupart, arrangeants.
Bien sûr, quelques-uns font exception.
- L'Évêque Fisher, je suppose.
- Parfaitement.
Puis-je savoir qui d'autre ?
L'Archevêque, lui-même.
Warham.
Après des années de flexibilité,
il est brusquement devenu intransigeant.
Il se fait vieux. De ce fait,
il est plus proche de son Créateur
avec qui il pourra s'expliquer.
Il sera sûrement
aisé pour lui d'expliquer
comme il envisage de libérer l'Église
de la superstition, des religions
factices et de l'avidité du clergé.
Monsieur Rouss.
Oui, Sir.
Le cuisinier...
Faisons un accord.
Oui, Sir.
Vous comprenez ce qu'on attend de vous ?
Tout à fait.
Oui.
Ceci pour vos désagréments.
Si vous nous trahissez,
je détruirais toute votre famille.
Majesté,
voici M. Cranmer
dont on a souvent parlé.
C'est M. Cranmer qui m'avait signalé
que l'affaire de Votre Majesté
était un problème théologique,
et non pas légal.
M. Cranmer...
J'avais le désir de vous rencontrer
plus que toute autre personne.
Vous êtes le bienvenu à ma cour.
- Majesté, je...
- C'est amusant.
Les plus grands esprits de mon Royaume
ont sué sang et eau
pour un problème que vous,
un petit curé,
sans vouloir vous offenser,
avez pu résoudre avec une simplicité,
et une clarté d'esprit qui...
a jeté la honte sur eux.
Majesté, je...
Je...
M. Cranmer, Sa Majesté
a décidé de vous nommer
son aumônier personnel.
Je...
Vous devez remercier Sa Majesté.
Majesté...
Vous êtes le bienvenu, M. Cranmer.
- M. Cromwell.
- Majesté.
Parfait, M. Cranmer.
Parfait.
Tu as donc épousé ta pupille.
Quel est son nom ?
Catherine Brook.
Catherine...
Pourquoi elle ?
J'aime et admire Mlle Brooke.
Je suis un enfant
qui a besoin d'une mère.
Quel âge a-t-elle ?
17 ans.
Quelle mère !
Pauvre Catherine.
Tu ne sais pas rester fidèle, Charles,
qu'est-ce qui t'arrive ?
- Cette fois, c'est différent.
- Comment ?
Je l'ignore.
Je le sens.
Ce n'est point parce qu'elle est belle.
C'est l'union de deux âmes.
Vous le comprenez certainement.
Oh soleil, vas-t-en.
Revenons à nos besognes.
Je vous aime, Anne Boleyn.
Je vous aimerai toujours.
Toujours...
Comment pouvez-vous dire cela, Thomas ?
Quand, malheureusement,
le temps nous fait changer.
Le temps ne me changera pas.
Toujours...
Thomas...
Lady Anne...
Je voulais vous féliciter
pour votre merveilleuse ascension.
Merci, Thomas.
Je n'oublierai pas
notre grande amitié.
Eh bien,
j'aurais voulu l'oublier.
Mais je vois que
vous aussi avez progressé.
Je suis devenu une sorte de diplomate.
Je remercie M. Cromwell
pour sa protection,
nous autres poètes, savons nous adapter.
Je voudrais vous présenter quelqu'un.
Lady Boleyn, voici Mark Smithen.
Maître de danse, chanteur, musicien,
- un génie, en somme.
- M. Smithen.
Il aime se faire appeler
Mark le musicien.
Comment peut-on simplement
l'appeler "le musicien" ?
Milady...
C'est un grand honneur.
- Vous jouez du violon ?
- En effet.
Jouez-moi quelque chose.
Avec plaisir.
Voulez-vous m'apprendre ?
Je voulais remercier Votre Grâce
pour son discours à l'assemblée.
C'était bien dit et très courageux.
Je n'ai dit que la vérité.
Je suis sûr que l'ajournement,
aussi longtemps que
la Loi du Christ le permet,
va, en effet, annuler
toute la proposition.
Comment Notre Seigneur
permettrait-il qu'un laïque,
serait-ce un Roi,
soit à la tête de l'Église ?
Juste un peu pour moi, mon garçon.
Je dois vous demander, Sir Thomas.
Envisagez-vous encore
de vous défaire de vos fonctions ?
Je dois vous avouer qu'après le vote,
j'étais fortement tenté.
Mais après réflexion,
je me réjouis de rester
à défendre la chrétienté.
C'est une excellente nouvelle.
Comme l'est aussi
le revirement de l'Archevêque.
Dieu merci, sa conscience
l'a amené à condamner
l'affaire de l'annulation du Roi.
Et il persiste dans son intention de...
s'opposer à la législation.
Ce qui pourrait nuire à l'Église.
Allez chercher le médecin !
Au secours !
Mon Dieu...
Quatre hommes ont péri.
L'Évêque Fisher est en vie car il
n'a consommé que peu de soupe.
C'est malheureux, Sir Thomas.
C'est plus que cela, Votre Majesté.
Le cuisinier de Fisher a été arrêté.
Mais je dois dire que...
les rumeurs abondent
sur l'identité des commanditaires.
Qui ?
Il a été nommément cité.
- Boleyn ?
- Oui.
Et...
Eh bien, certains accusent Lady Anne.
Les gens l'accusent de tout.
Ils l'accusent en cas de pluie...
ou de sécheresse.
Ils l'accusent de l'éloignement
de la Reine et du fait que je l'aime.
Pour le vent
qui a détruit notre récolte,
et la tempête
qui a coulé nos bateaux.
Tout est de la faute de Lady Anne.
Et vous, Sir Thomas ?
L'accusez-vous ?
Pensez-vous qu'elle a voulu
tuer l'Evéque Fisher ?
- Harry...
- Le temps de "Harry" est révolu !
Quel que soit le coupable...
Rouss le cuisinier a tenté,
quasiment avec succès, d'empoisonner
un serviteur de Votre Majesté,
Évêque de notre Sainte Église,
et moi-même.
À présent, si Votre Majesté
tient à ignorer cette offense,
ils supposeront que
cette tentative de meurtre
s'est faite avec votre bénédiction.
TOUR DE LONDRES
Milord Boleyn.
Monsieur Rouss,
on peut continuer cela toute la journée.
Alors...
une fois encore.
Qui vous a remis le poison ?
M. Rouss, il est inconcevable
que vous ayez pris seul la décision
d'assassiner votre maître et ses hôtes,
après l'avoir aussi bien servi,
pendant ces quatre dernières années.
Qui vous a remis le poison ?
J'ai trois filles, Monsieur.
Que voulez-vous dire ?
Je voulais qu'elles aient de bons maris.
Mais cela demande de l'argent.
Nous pouvons vous rétribuer
pour votre information.
Non, Monsieur...
J'ai déjà été rétribué.
Le compte est réglé.
Vous êtes fou.
Et vous allez mourir pour cela.
Attendez !
À qui portez-vous ces tissus ?
- À Sa Majesté, la Reine.
- Pourquoi ?
Pour faire des chemises à Sa Majesté.
Elle l'a toujours fait.
Elle continue à lui faire ses chemises ?
Oui... Maîtresse Anne.
- Ma chérie.
- Comment avez-vous osé ?
- Quoi ?
- Vos chemises !
Vous la laissez encore
vous faire vos chemises !
Je n'y avais même pas pensé.
Vous m'aviez dit qu'il n'y avait
aucune intimité entre vous.
Quelle intimité ?
Ce ne sont que des chemises.
Ce ne sont pas que des chemises.
Il y a vous et moi...
Il y a vous et elle !
- Je ne comprends pas.
- Et vous ne le voulez pas.
Nous sommes sur le point
de nous marier
et elle est encore là.
Un mariage ne se fait pas à trois.
Ne le comprenez-vous pas ?
Ne comprenez-vous pas
que j'ai mieux à faire
que de m'occuper de mes chemises ?
<i>Le Roi a consenti à une nouvelle
et sévère punition pour le cuisinier.</i>
Il sera ébouillanté.
C'est judicieux de sa part
d'être aussi sévère.
Mais il ne pourra pas
éliminer quelques doutes.
Du moins, ceux concernant
cette Lady et son père.
Nous sommes tous
entre les mains de Dieu.
Mais ce qui me préoccupe,
en restant étendu ici,
inutilement,
c'est que le Roi pourra
avoir son divorce, du moment...
qu'il s'en donnera le pouvoir.
On m'a rapporté
lors de la dernière assemblée
que le Roi est devenu furieux.
Il a demandé à savoir
qu'est-ce qui arriverait
s'il épousait Anne
sans la permission du Pape.
Et... qu'ont-ils dit ?
Seul Boleyn l'a soutenu.
Pas même son ami, Brandon.
Dieu merci.
Catherine !
Mon époux...
- Comment vous sentez-vous ?
- Pardon ?
On m'a dit que vous aviez
un mal de dents,
et je sais la douleur intense.
- Et que vous aviez la goutte.
- Bien sûr que je ne l'ai pas.
Pourquoi prêtez-vous attention
à ces stupides rumeurs ?
Parce que je m'inquiète pour vous.
Catherine...
Vous devrez cesser
de me faire mes chemises.
Vous aimez les chemises
que je vous fais.
Vous portez l'une d'elles.
- Henry ?
- Quoi encore ?
Notre fille Mary...
ne se porte pas très bien.
Elle ne tolère aucune nourriture
depuis huit jours.
Ne croyez-vous pas
qu'on doit lui rendre visite ?
Vous pouvez lui rendre visite,
si vous voulez.
Et vous pouvez y rester.
Henry, ni notre fille ni personne,
ne me fera vous quitter.
Vous savez que ma place est à vos côtés.
Je me livre à la miséricorde de Dieu.
Dieu vous bénisse, Sir.
Dites à mes filles que ma mort
a été rapide, et sans souffrance.
La tête en premier ?
Ou comme ça vient ?
Sauvez-moi...
Assieds-toi.
Ta femme est très belle.
Vous semblez heureux ensemble.
Oui, nous le sommes.
Un heureux mariage
demande confiance et dévotion.
À ce sujet,
je voudrais te confier une mission.
Votre Grâce.
Je dois parler seul à Votre Majesté.
Pourquoi le Roi vous a-t-il envoyé,
à cette heure tardive ?
Le Roi vous demande d'être raisonnable.
Retirez votre requête à Rome
et mettez votre affaire entre ses mains.
Et il promet d'être
plus généreux à votre égard.
Le parlement veut le nommer
autorité suprême,
aussi bien spirituelle que temporelle.
Non.
Seul le Pape
a le pouvoir divin sur Terre.
Et lui seul est garant
de la vérité éternelle.
- Oui, mais le Roi...
- Votre Grâce.
Je continue à aimer Sa Majesté bien plus
qu'aucune autre femme au monde.
Mais jamais je n'aurais été
son épouse, même un instant,
si je devais taire
les voix de ma conscience.
Je suis son authentique épouse.
Allez à Rome si vous voulez,
et débattez-en avec
d'importantes personnalités,
je resterai ici en compagnie
d'une pauvre femme.
Qu'a-t-elle dit ?
Elle dit qu'elle vous obéira dans tout,
à l'exception de sa dévotion
pour l'autorité suprême.
Quelle autorité suprême ?
Celle du Pape et de l'Empereur ?
Non.
Dieu et sa conscience.
Chapuis.
Majesté...
Dites à votre maître
et à qui vous voulez...
que jamais je n'accepterai
le jugement du Pape.
Et peu importe
si ce traître m'excommunie.
Il fait ce qu'il veut à Rome,
je fais ce que je veux, ici.
Majesté.
À propos...
bon retour à la cour.
Majesté.
Comment était la Reine ?
Elle était splendide.
Je n'oserai pas la définir autrement.
Vous m'aviez dit que,
parfois, vous me rendriez triste.
Même si vous n'en avez pas l'intention.
Vous allez vraiment me rendre triste ?
Non.
Je jure sur ce qu'il y a de plus sacré
que tout va bien se passer.
Et avec vous,
je serai toujours sincère.
Je ne changerai jamais.
Je ne vous en voudrais pas
si vous ne me croyez pas.
Vous me croyez ?
Majesté.
- Vous m'avez demandée ?
- Anne.
Cela vous plairait-il
d'aller demain à la chasse ?
Si cela est le désir de Votre Majesté.
Nous serons absents quelques temps.
Rencontrer le peuple.
Se mêler à lui.
Majesté, de quoi s'agit-il ? Je...
Et à notre retour,
nous serons seuls.
Seuls ?
Vous et moi.
Ici.
Sans nul autre.
L'entendez-vous ?
J'ai déjà donné instruction
à Catherine de partir.
Mon Dieu !
Êtes-vous la plus heureuse ?
Mon époux...
Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Je l'ai vu.
- Quoi ?
- Qu'avez-vous vu ?
- Depuis longtemps...
Je savais ce que cela signifiait.
Le faux prophète...
Il y avait tant de signes...
Je ne comprends toujours pas.
Qu'avez-vous vu ?
La bête...
L'antéchrist...
La fin est proche, Alice.
Allez-y.
- N'oubliez pas mes chapeaux
- Oui, Madame.
Merveilleuse journée pour une ballade.
Merveilleuse.
Prenez soin d'elle, John.
Je vous la confie.
Allons-y.
Milady, M. Cromwell
est ici pour vous voir.
Madame...
Sa Majesté vous ordonne
de quitter ce lieu, dans le mois,
et de vous établir
dans sa demeure à More.
Il ne m'a même pas saluée.
Vous serez autorisée à prendre
vos servantes et dames de compagnie.
Qu'importe où j'irai,
je demeure sa femme.
Et je prierai pour lui.
Il y a...
autre chose.
Sa Majesté souhaiterait
que vous lui remettiez
les joyaux officiels
de Reine d'Angleterre.
Non !
Je ne renoncerai pas
à ce qui m'appartient de droit,
pour les donner à une femme
qui est le scandale de la chrétienté.
Que Dieu bénisse Votre Majesté.
Votre Majesté.
- Merci.
- Votre Majesté.
Que Dieu bénisse Votre Majesté.
- Merci.
- Dieu vous bénisse.
Merci à vous tous.
Soyez bénie, Milady.
La Reine de la demeure.
Une foule plus grande vous saluera...
lors de votre retour à Londres.
Oui, entrez.
Alors ?
Majesté, on m'a demandé
de vous communiquer
un message de la Reine.
Elle regrette que vous n'ayez pas
souhaité la saluer.
Et elle s'inquiète de l'état de santé
de Votre Majesté.
Je n'ai pas voulu saluer la Reine.
Et je ne veux pas
lui offrir de consolation.
Peu importe que
mon état de santé la préoccupe.
Alors, cessez cela
et vaquez à vos occupations !
- Vous comprenez ?
- Oui, Votre Majesté.
Hors de ma vue !
Je suis désolé.
Ne vous excusez pas.
Comment pourrait-il en être autrement ?
Je veux dire que tout est merveilleux.
Ne croyez-vous pas ?
Que tout est merveilleux ?
Oui.
Tout est merveilleux.
C'est une sorcière.
Le seul sort qu'elle mérite,
c'est d'être envoyée en enfer.
Allez-vous assassiner Lady Anne ?
Étant un proche serviteur du Roi,
je suis le mieux placé pour cela.
Elle l'a séduit et ensorcelé,
le contraignant à trahir sa légitime
épouse et notre Sainte Église.
On ne doit pas s'attarder.
Mais nos prières et nos espoirs
vous accompagnent.

His Majesty, the King.
<i>Previously..
It is settled.
We are to war with France.
Now,
I can go play.
- Sir Thomas More.
- Thomas.
Your Majesty.
You didn't say much
in counsel last night.
- About what?
- Going to war with France.
As a humanist, I have abhorrence of war.
As a king, I'm forced to disagree.
- Now, there is someone I have to try.
- A hundred crowns you don't succeed.
Done.
I'm ranking you Duke.
Duke of Suffolk.
- How does that please Your Grace?
- Celebrate!
He has no right to any of this.
I'm a direct descendant of Edward II.
This is my crown!
Hold Your Grace. Your Grace's arrested
on suspicion of treason.
I have no heir.
The Tudor Dynasty.
All my father's work finished,
and it's my fault!
Henry, will you not visit my
bedchamber, as you used to?
Things are not well between us.
His Majesty and I.
I think sometimes
he'll ask me for a divorce.
A divorce? That's impossible.
Is it?
His Majesty is tiring of your sister.
When she was his mistress,
all our fortunes were made.
They say that all his
liaisons are soon over.
He blows hot.
He blows cold.
Perhaps, you could imagine a
way to keep his interest more.
prolonged? to play his passions.
- Who are you?
- Anne Boleyn.
Mr. Wyatt, were you in
love with Anne Boleyn?
Of course I loved her, but
from a distance.
Never if you value your life, speak
of me to others, do you understand?
You must know that I desire
you with all my heart.
It is your duty to use
his love to our advantage.
No, not like this.
Seduce me.
I know what you're doing.
But do not think to take the King away.
When we're married,
I'll deliver you a son.
Everything within my power to give
you to you, it's yours, just ask.
I want a divorce,
and you will get one for me.
A divorce? I don't think that
English people would ever forgive him.
As far as I'm concerned,
our marriage has ended.
Soon he will see what you really are,
and he will tire of you.
And what if he does not?
If she gets her way,
she'll set our whole
country in her rule.
I have someone to
conclave of the cardinals,
to make a final judgment
on Your Majesty's annulment.
Make sure they come
to the right decision.
In this case, Eminence,
your reach has exceeded your grasp.
What if someone is
deliberately stalling?
Delaying things, making excuses.
You've gone cold on this divorce.
Perhaps, you've never
believed in the first place.
You lied to me, pretending
to be on my side.
Majesty!
If you are not for me now,
then you are against me.
Wolsey, sir, in the name of the King,
you're arrested by order of the King
and charged with high treason. / No!
You know, I don't wanna be chancellor.
You will do as I commend!
You think Mr. Cromwell is a great man?
No, I think he's a coming man.
As your Majesty well knows,
Kings are set above the law.
They're answerable to God
alone, who anointed them.
Thank you, Mr. Cromwell.
I shall denounce the Pope as a
heretic and marry whom I please.
If you want the world to know
that the King of England is
incapable of keeping his
word, then you have to.
I am merely Your Majesty's
humble servant.
I swear to you now,
everything will be different.
To hell!
I am the King of England!
If lion knows his own strength,
no man could control him.

- Your Grace.
- Lord Thomas.
Ambassador Chapuys.
I thought you had abandoned us.
It's true. I did,
or tried to.
In our conscience, I could
never abandon Her Majesty.
She's the most gracious and
wonderful woman in the world,
and the sadest.
I agree with you.
So does the Emperor.
He has written this
letter of an encouragement
and support,
for your efforts on her behalf.
I beg you not to deliver it to me.
Already I given more than sufficient
prove of my loyalty to the king...
I must have nothing to provoke suspicions.
Consider the times we live in.
I don't want to be deprived of the liberty,
which will allow me to speak boldly in private.
about this matters which concern
your master and the queen.
I understand.
You need to say no more.
- Thank you, Mr. Cromwell.
- Your Majesty.
Sir Thomas More.
Cromwell.
Sir Thomas.
Your Majesty.
I must tell you.
I've received a petition from the
members of the House of Commons
complaining of the cruel behavior
and abuses of the prelates
and the clergy.
Thomas..
people are asking for
freedom from clerical rule.
Your Majesty knows...
very well that I've always condamned the abuses of
the clergy. When they have been brought to light.
As your chancellor,
I have worked hard to eliminate
them and purify our Holy Church.
But..
You know where I stand.
You've always known.
I cannot condone this..
new fangled vision of private
belief and personal grace.
For me, the church is the permanent
and living sign of God's presence.
It is a visible, palpable community.
Not just a few breather and
gathered secret rooms.
Then, you'll speak against me.
My loyalty and love for
Your Majesty is so great
that I'll never say a
word against you in public.
So, help me, God.
Arise for the King!
- Majesty.
- Majesty.
My Lord, Your Graces
We are come here among
you to hear your response
to the charges and
responsibilities laid against you.
You're generally charged with supporting
the authority of the late Cardinal Wolsey,
and the Bishop of Rome, against
that of your own king and country.
Some here among you may suppose
I seek personal advantage.
It is not so.
As your king, I'm commission to
restore right order on Earth.
and assert the immunities
and princely liberties.
of our realm and crown.
This is my sacred duty.
Seal before God,
and by solemn oath at my coronation.
What is your conclusion,
Archbishop Warham?
Your Majesty,
before I deliver it, I give way to His Grace,
the Most Reverend Bishop Fisher,
The Bishop of Rochester.
My Lords,
we are asked to admit His Majesty
as Supreme Head of
the Church in England.
Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee this
to the king without abandoning
our unity with the sea of Rome.
If we are to renounce the
unity of the Christian world,
and leap out of Peter's ship,
then we shall be drown in the waves of
all heresies, sex, schisms and divisions.
I'm saying to you
that the acceptance of
legal supremacy over our Holy Church
would represent a tearing a thunder,
of the seamless coat of Christ.
Your Grace!
We'll hear your judgment.
I'll put this proposal to Congregation
that Your Majesty has a new title.
supreme head of the Church
and clergy of England,
but I had the caveat.
as far,
as the law of Christ alone,
Who is in favor?
Very well.
(in Latin)
whoever remained silent.
So, they're assumed to be agreed.
Thank you, Your Grace.
<i>Rome
- Cardinal Campeggio!
- Holy Father.
Sit down, Cardinal Campeggio.
I know you're hard to go.
And my feet are killing me too.
What'd you want to see me about?
We have received 2 new letters regarding
to King of England, the Great Matter.
Oh, not again.
What do they say?
Well, the first one's from the King himself, writing
cordial to make a final and favorable decision,
on his noun and for the
sake of peace in England.
He uses a salmon temperate
language of Holiness,
complaining that never there
was any prince handled by a Pope
"as Your Holiness has treated us."
He meant my predecessor and
frankly, he has the point.
Clemente was a terrible
procrastinator, indeed.
Although it was very wrong
for some people to dig up
the dead body and stabbed it in the street,
I can well understand that feelings.
He was never popular.
Requiescat in pace.
And the second letter?
From the Emperor on behalf of his aunt,
Catherine, the unhappy queen,
urging you to prevent interment,
and ex-communicate the King.
It is true, we must come to a judgment.
On the other hand,
to protect the interest of the Church,
we should try not to antagonize
one par above the other, after all,
they have soldiers and guns while as
we must make duel with beauty and truth.
What about this girl,
this putane, the King's whole?
Anne Boleyn.
Yes, why doesn't someone
just get rid of her?
No.
Don't get up.
Stay like that.
You're so very beautiful,
so very desirable.
I have to possess you completely.
I can't wait.
Oh, my love.
Just a little longer,
and then..
I've made the head of
the Church of England.
Is it true?
Then I'm so.. glad.
At last, you'll have your right,
and can do as your will.
I'm glad to have Cromwell refurbish
some of the apartments in the Tower.
Every Queen of England stays there
before the coronation.
Papa.
What's wrong?
Don't you want to celebrate?
It's far too early for that.
The bishops are not really defeated.
By default, they voted to make
the King head of the Church,
but only as far,
as the law of Christ allows.
You don't have to be a clever lawyer to know that the
lord of Christ may be used to invalidate the vot itself.
Then it was all for nothing.
No,
not for nothing.
The principle has now been
effectively conceded by most of them.
As George told me,
there're resistance and recalcitrance
really stand from only one man.
- That bloody Bishop Fisher.
- Fisher.
- Sir?
- Ah, Mr. Cranmer!
I'm so sorry to be late, Mr. Cranmer.
It's completely unforgivable.
Nonsense, we haven't even begun dining.
It's good to see you.
- Mr. Boleyn
- Mr. Wyatt, this is Mr. Cranmer.
Mr. Cranmer, you are a man
of the cloth, I believe.
- And are you not a poet, Mr. Wyatt?
- That's the least of my sense.
You may take one of my
confession after suffer.
I wouldn't if I were you.
It'll turn your head wired.
We were discussing before you arrived, the
progress of the Congregation of Bishops,
which was called to decide
upon the King's supremacy.
His majesty has wisely decided to appoint
George Boleyn here to negotiate with Their Graces.
I found most of them accommodating.
Of course, there're a
few stubborn exceptions.
- Bishop Fisher, I assume.
- True.
May I ask who else?
The archbishop himself.
Warren.
After years being perfectly pliable,
he suddenly become rather intransigent.
It's because he's old,
and consequently, he's closer to his maker,
to whom undue course he must explain himself?
Well, I'm sure that there'll be
a simple matter of him to explain
how he helped liberate his church from
superstition, religious false
of the ecclesiastical greed.
Mr. Rouss.
Yes, sir.
A cook
like trade.
Yes, sir.
You understand what we expect of you?
I do, yes.
This is for your trouble.
If you betray us,
I'll destroy your entire family.
Majesty, this is Mr. Cranmar,
whom I have often spoken.
to ask Mr. Cranmer who
first spoke the fact that
Your Majesty's great matter was
a theological issue and not legal one.
Mr. Cranmer.
I have desire to meet you almost
above any person now living.
You're most welcome here at court.
- Majesty, I..
- It's funny.
Some of the greatest and most
celebrated minds in my kingdom,
sweated and struggled over an issue which you,
an obcure caraf, if you forgive me,
was able to resolve with perfect
simplicity and a clarity of mind which..
put a mold of shame.
Majesty, I..
Um.. I..
Mr. Cranmer, His Majesty has decided
to appoint you his personal chaplain.
I.. ah..
You must thank His Majesty.
Majesty.
You are welcome here, Mr. Cranmer.
- Mr. Cromwell.
- Majesty.
Well done, Mr. Cranmer, well done.
So you married your wad?
What's her name?
Catherine Brook.
Catherine...
Why her?
I love and admire Miss Brooke.
Reminds me of my mother.
How old is she?
Seventeen.
Some mother.
Poor Catherine.
You're incapable of fidelity,
Charles, you always have them.
This time is different.
How different?
I don't know.
I just feel it.
And it is not because she's beautiful.
It is a marriage of two souls.
I'm sure you can understand that.
Oh, sun, go away.
Leave us to our own defiance.
I love you, Anne Boleyn.
I always will.
Always.
How could you say that, Thomas?
No unfortune brings what time changes.
Time won't change me,
or this.
Thomas.
My Lady Anne.
I'd like to congratulate
you for reaching so high.
Thank you, Thomas.
I sure never forget that
we were once true friends.
Oh, I wish I could forget.
But I see you are raised, too.
Well, it is a.. sometimes diplomat,
thanks to the patronage of Mr. Cromwell,
We person painters,sometimes
have our uses.
There is someone here
I sure you'd like to meet.
Lady Anne Boleyn, this is Mark Smithen,
dancing master, singer, musician,
and a general all round genius.
Mr. Smithen.
He likes to be called just plain Mark.
How could he possibly be called plain?
My lady, it's a great pleasure.
- You play the violin?
- Indeed.
Play me something.
Of course.
Will you share me?
I wanted to thank Your Grace
for your speech to congregation.
It was well said.
- and very brave.
- I spoke only truth.
I believe that the caveat,
so far is the law of Christ allows,
does indeed invalidated the whole bill.
How can the law of
Christ permit a lame on,
even a king, to be head of the Church?
Boy, a little for me.
I must ask you, Sir Thomas,
If you still have a mind
to resign your office..
After the vot, Your Grace,
I must confess I was solely tempted.
But on reflection,
I'm contempt to stand
fight for Christianity.
Oh, this is excellent news.
As indeed, is the turning
again of the archibishop.
I thank God that his conscience
has finally driven him to condemn
the King's solely suit.
And he has stated his intention to...
oppose the legislation,
which might be injurious to the Church.
Get a doctor.
Call a doctor, quick!
Help! Please help!
Oh, god, god..
Four men died of that pains.
Bishop Fisher survived then
because he ate a little of the soup.
It's very unfortunate, Sir Thomas.
It's more than
unfortunate, Your Majesty.
Fisher's cook has been arrested,
but I must tell you that..
that rumors abound us to the identity
of those who part of against him.
Who?
Wilchare's been named.
- Boleyn?
- Yes.
And...
well, some people even blame the Lady Anne.
Also people would blame her for everything!
They'll blame her if there're rains,
or if the rains fell.
They'll blame her for the baroness of the
queen, and for the fact that I love her.
They'll blame her for the
wind that destroys our crops,
and the storms that sink our ships.
It's all the fault of the Lady Anne.
What about you, Sir Thomas?
Do you blame her?
Do you think she'd try
to poison Bishop Fisher?
- Henry..
- All the time for "Henry" is over!
Whoever was to blame..
the cook, Rouss, tried
blatantly and almost successfully,
to poison one of Your Majesty's
great public servers, the bishop
of our Holy Church, as well as me.
Now, if Your Majesty would
turn up blind eye to a few things.
everyone would be forced to assume
that the attempted murders were
done with your blessing.
My lord, Boleyn.
Mr. Rouss, we can go over
and over this all day, so
one more time,
who gave you poison?
Mr. Rouss, it is inconceivable that you should suddenly
take upon yourself to murder your master and his household.
after serving him so diligently
these past four years.
Who gave you poison?
Sir, I have three daughters.
What does that mean?
I want them to find good husbands,
but that takes money.
We can pay you for your information.
No, sir.
Payment is already paid.
You can't set on it.
You're a fool,
and you will die for it.
You, hold a moment.
Where're you taking this linen?
- To the Queen's Majesty.
- Why?
To make shirts for His Majesty.
She always does that.
She still makes his shirts?
Yes. Yes, Miss Anne.
- Sweetheart.
- How could you?
- What?
- Your shirts!
She still makes your shirts!
How could you let her?
I haven't even thought about it.
You told me there was nothing
intimate between you anymore.
There isn't. What intimate.
They're just shirts for god's sake.
No, they're not just shirts.
They're you and me.
They're you and her!
- I don't understand.
- Then you want to.
It's so hard when we're to be
married, but she's still here!
You can't have three people in a marriage,
why can't you see that?
And why can't you understand that I have
more things to think about than my shirts!
The King has agreed to a new
and harsh treatment of prisoners.
They would be boiled alive.
He's wise to have dealt
so severe in this case.
But he cannot avoid some suspicions.
At least against the
lady and her father.
We're all in the hands of God.
But I worry about why
I lie here uselessly.
The King might proceed
with his divorce, since
he has given himself the power.
I was told that at the last counsel,
the King became angry.
and demanded to know what would
happen if he went ahead anyway
and marry to Anne without
Pope's permission?
- That.. what did they say?
- Only Boleyn supported him,
not even his friend, Brandon.
Thank god.
Catherine!
Husband.
How are you feeling?
What?
They told me you've been suffering from
toothache which I know is a terrible pain
and someone even said
you have a touch of gout.
Of course, I don't have gout.
I don't know why you even listen to such stupid rumors.
Because I care for you.
Catherine.
You're gonna have to
stop making my shirts.
I thought you liked the
shirts I made for you.
I see where you're wearing one.
- Henry.
- What now?
Our daughter Mary has..
has been not well.
She has not kept any food
on for eight days now.
Do you not think we should visit her?
You can go and visit
the princess if you like,
and you can stay there.
Even not for our daughter, not for anyone
would I dream of leaving you.
You know my rightful
place is by your side.
I can sign myself to God's mercy.
Bless you, sir.
Tell my girls I died easily,
and with no pain.
Head first?
Or wherever it comes?
Sit.
Your wife looks very beautiful,
seem very happy together.
Yes, we are.
Happy marriage is devoutely
something to be wished for.
To open the bridge,
I want you to do something for me.
Your Grace.
I need to speak to Your Majesty alone.
The King has sent you? at this hour, why?
The King wants you to be sensible.
withdraw your appeal to Rome, and
entrust your face with his hands.
And he promises to be more generous.
As you know, the parliament
is about to make him supreme
in the matter spiritual,
as well as temporal.
No.
Only the Pope has God's
power here on earth,
and is the image of eternal truth.
- Yes, but the King..
- Your Grace,
I love and have loved His Majesty
as much as any woman can love a man.
But I would not have wanted him
company as his wife, one moment
against the voice of my conscience.
I am his true wife.
Go to Rome if you want, and argue
it there with lots of important men,
instead of here,
it's just one poor woman.
What did she say?
She said that she'll obey
Your Majesty in everything.
Serve her obedience
to two higher powers.
Which two higher powers?
The Pope and the Emperor?
No.
God and her conscience.
Chapuys.
Majesty.
You can tell your master.
Actually, you can tell anyone you like.
I'll never agree to be judged
by the Pope in this matter,
and I don't care if Figavus
tries to excommunicate me.
He can do what he likes in Rome,
I'll do what I like here.
Majesty.
And by the way,
welcome back to court.
Majesty.
How was the Queen?
She was beautiful.
She's like a thing of the
other world once I got you.
I remember you once told me that..
you might sometimes
have to make me feel sad,
even if you didn't mean to.
Are you really going to make me sad?
No.
I swear to all that is holy.
All things will be in good.
And to you, I'll always be true,
never changing.
I wouldn't blame you
if you don't believe me.
Do you believe me?
Majesty.
- You're sent for me?
- Anne.
How should you like
to go hunting tomorrow?
If that is what Your Majesty desires.
We may be away for a while,
visit people,
stay with em.
Majesty, what is this all about?
And when we return,
we shall be alone.
Alone?
You and I,
here,
No other person.
Do you mean it?
I've already given instructions
for Catherine to leave.
Oh, my god.
Are you the most happyer?
Husband, what is this?
- I saw it.
- What?
- What did you see?
- After a long time...
I knew Lutheran tend
to haul a false prophet.
And so many signs..
I still don't understand.
What is it you've seen?
The Beast. The Antichrist.
He's near at hand, Alice.
- You remember to pet him to drive?
- Yes, Madam.
Beautiful morning for a ride.
Beautiful.
Be very careful with it, John,
on your own.
Let's go.
Move on.
My Lady, Mr. Secretary Cromwell
is here to see you.
Madam.
His Majesty commands that he'll be
gone from this place within a month
and settle at his house in More.
He did not even say good-bye.
You are free, of course, to take
with your attendance and servants.
Wherever I go,
I remain his wife,
and I'll pray for him.
There's ah.. another matter.
His Majesty wishes that you return to him
the official jewels of Queen of England.
No!
I'll not give up
with these rightfully mine
to adorn a woman who was
the scandal of Christianity.
Bless Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
God bless Your Majesty.
God bless you.
Thank you.
- God bless Your Majesty!
- Thank all of you.
Blessing Lady.
Queen of Hearts.
There will be even crazier
crowds than this to welcome you..
when you return to London.
Yes? Come.
Well?
Majesty, I'm asked to pass on a
message of farewell from the Queen.
She regrets that you did
not wish her goodbye,
and she inquires after
Your Majesty's health.
The Queen! I do not
want any her goodbyes,
and I'm not wish to
offer her consolation!
I do not care whether she
ask after my health or not.
Let her stop this, and
mind our own business!
- Do you understand me!
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Get out!
I'm sorry.
Don't apologize.
How could things be different?
Indeed, everything is beautiful.
Don't you think?
Everything is beautiful?
Yes.
Everything is beautiful.
She's a witch,
who deserves all the fate
and to be dispatched to hell.
And who will you assassinate?
The Lady Anne?
Be the closer servant to the King.
I'm in a position to do so.
She seduced and bewitched him.
Consider his betraying his
lawful wife and the Holy Church.
We must not stay any longer,
but our prayers and hopes go with you.

<i>Précédemment...</i>
Nous avons reçu deux lettres
au sujet de l'affaire
du Roi d'Angleterre.
<i>La première est du Roi vous priant
d'émettre une décision ultime</i>
<i>à son annulation,
pour le bien de l'Angleterre.</i>
Votre Majesté a un nouveau titre.
Chef suprême de l'Église.
Aussi longtemps que
la Loi du Christ l'autorise.
Je ne peux tolérer
cette vision de croyances privées.
<i>Pour moi, l'Église est un signe
vivant de la présence divine.</i>
- Et la deuxième lettre ?
- De l'Empereur,
vous exhortant à éviter l'annulation,
et à excommunier le Roi.
Nous sommes sur le point
de nous marier
<i>et elle est encore là.</i>
<i>Un mariage ne se fait pas à trois.</i>
Ne le comprenez-vous pas ?
Il voulait savoir ce qui arriverait
s'il l'épousait sans l'accord du Pape.
<i>Seul Boleyn l'a soutenu.
Pas même son ami, Brandon.</i>
<i>Sa Majesté vous ordonne
de quitter ce lieu.</i>
Qu'importe où j'irai,
je demeure sa femme.
La résistance est entre
les mains d'un seul homme.
Vous comprenez ce qu'on attend de vous ?
Si vous nous trahissez,
je détruirais toute votre famille.
<i>Quatre hommes ont péri.
Certains accusent Lady Anne.</i>
Les gens l'accusent de tout.
Le temps de "Harry" est fini !
<i>À propos de cette catin,
la pute du Roi ?</i>
Pourquoi personne
ne nous en a débarrassés ?
<i>Elle l'a séduit et ensorcelé,
le contraignant à trahir son épouse.</i>
Allez-vous assassiner Lady Anne ?

<i>Et je dis que
nous continuerons à insister</i>
sur l'immunité de l'Église
aux ingérences laïques.
Et nous devrons continuer à insister,
car cette immunité
a été ordonnée par Dieu.
Cette immunité aux ingérences laïques
doit être étendue aux prêtres ordonnés,
et aux serviteurs
de notre Sainte Église.
Ils seront préservés
des menaces de mort,
et du mal engendré par l'empoisonnement,
ou des méthodes analogues.
Quand leur seul crime
est d'avoir obéi à la loi divine,
et de proclamer la sainteté de l'Église.
Je vous prie de comprendre...
Le Roi ne doit pas permettre cela.
Le vote est crucial.
Un jour ou l'autre, il brisera l'église.
Maintenant, et pour toujours.
Bonjour, Mark.
Qu'y a-t-il, M. Wyatt ?
C'est Noël, la fête des bons vœux.
Qu'ont-ils tous ?
Plus maintenant, les choses ont changé.
Au cas où vous ne l'auriez pas vu,
la Reine n'est pas ici.
Pourquoi cela devrait-il
nous attrister ?
Les Français disent
qu'une cour sans femmes
est comme un jardin sans fleurs.
Lady Anne, un présent de Noël
de la part de Sa Majesté.
Merci, Votre Majesté.
J'ai aussi ordonné
qu'on bâtisse un grand lit.
Il est presque prêt.
Votre Majesté, un présent
de la part de Lady Anne.
De modestes lances.
Conçues à la manière des Basques.
Les meilleurs !
Merci, chérie.
Un autre présent pour Votre Majesté.
Venez plus près.
C'est très beau.
Qui me l'a envoyé ?
Sa Majesté, La Reine Catherine,
Votre Majesté.
Je ne l'accepterai pas.
Emportez-le !
Ne la laissez pas tout gâcher.
Votre Majesté, le Chancelier,
Sir Thomas More.
Sir Thomas.
Majesté.
Maîtresse Anne.
J'ai un présent pour vous.
Avec votre permission.
Cela nous rappelle
ce que nous avons à célébrer.
Merci, Sir Thomas.
Je le garderai précieusement.
Nous devrons bientôt nous rencontrer.
Il y a beaucoup à faire
pour la gestion de ce royaume.
Il y a encore de l'agitation
contre les privilèges du clergé.
Et de leurs abus.
De plus amples mesures
devront être prises.
J'attends avec impatience
l'avis de Votre Majesté.
Thomas...
Joyeux Noël.
Votre Majesté.
Charles !
- Majesté.
- Joyeux Noël.
Joyeux Noël.
- Une partie de tennis ?
- Bonne idée.
- Puis-je vous parler honnêtement.
- J'espère bien.
Allez-vous vraiment épouser
Maîtresse Boleyn ?
Quels que soient
les conséquences ou le passé...
Pourquoi donc, Charles ?
Qu'entends-tu par "le passé" ?
Henry...
J'ai su de sources sûres qu'elle
et Thomas Wyatt étaient amants.
Ils ont forniqué moult fois,
et parfois, il entrait
impudemment dans sa chambre.
J'ai eu vent de ses rumeurs.
Elle les a démenties.
Cela est compréhensible, n'est-ce pas ?
J'ai dit qu'elle les a démenties.
Joyeux Noël !
Joyeux Noël, Milords !
Comment avez-vous
trouvé le Roi, M. Cranmer ?
Je vous jure qu'il est
le plus gentil de tous les princes.
Vous êtes né sous une bonne étoile.
Vous pouvez dire ce que vous voulez,
Sa Majesté s'en remettra
toujours à votre avis.
Je ne suis pas
assez arrogant pour croire
que je suis plus pour Sa Majesté
qu'un fidèle serviteur.
Votre modestie vous honore.
Mais, Sa Majesté pense que vous êtes
destiné à de plus grandes choses.
Il vous a désigné
son envoyé spécial
à la cour de l'Empereur.
Il ne peut faire cela !
Ce que je veux dire, c'est que...
Pourquoi moi ?
Je... Je ne suis rien, M. Cromwell.
Sa Majesté a confiance en vous.
Totalement.
Il sait que vous maîtrisez son affaire
mieux que quiconque.
Vous êtes le mieux placé pour
le représenter à la cour impériale.
Je suis persuadé que
vous aurez beaucoup de succès.
En route, vous aurez la chance
de visiter la ville de Nuremberg.
La première ville à être gérée par
des luthériens et des réformateurs,
haïssant la superstition et l'idolâtrie,
épargnée par l'indigence
et les abus du clergé.
J'attendrai votre compte rendu.
Le Duc de Suffolk a pris le risque
de colporter ces ragots,
au sujet de M. Wyatt et vous.
Et croyez-vous ce qu'il vous a dit ?
Si c'était le cas,
serais-je là en votre compagnie ?
Je suppose que
vous avez banni le Duc de la cour.
J'ai fait appeler
l'ambassadeur de France.
Je veux un nouveau traité
d'alliance avec la France,
pour contrer l'Empereur.
J'en suis ravie.
Vous connaissez
mes sentiments pour la France.
Mais, excusez-moi,
en quoi suis-je concernée ?
Il y a une autre raison pour ce voyage.
J'ai l'intention d'effectuer
cette visite en votre compagnie.
Je veux vous présenter, officiellement,
au Roi François.
En qualité de future épouse...
et future Reine d'Angleterre.
Mon Dieu !
Votre Grâce.
Peut-on parler ?
Je suis venu informer Votre Grâce,
en qualité d'Archevêque de Canterbury,
que le Roi veut une ratification,
pour la prochaine session du Parlement.
En quoi cela me concerne-t-il,
M. Cromwell ?
Vous devez dénoncer le Pape,
qui profite des revenus
de l'Église d'Angleterre.
Et à rédiger une soumission en ce sens.
Ce sont les privilèges à être
à la tête de l'église dans ce pays.
M. Cromwell,
quelles sont
les raisons de cette attaque
contre notre Sainte Église ?
Le peuple s'est fait
à l'idée que le clergé
est assis sur une fortune
qui pourrait être utilisée ailleurs.
Pour le bien du Commonwealth,
pour le bien des gens ordinaires.
Cela ne me semble pas être
une attaque contre des abus,
mais plutôt...
une attaque ouverte contre notre foi,
et la foi de nos ancêtres.
Ceci est votre opinion, Votre Grâce,
et non la mienne.
Et encore moins celle du Roi.
Gouvernante !
Oui, Madame.
Préparez mon bain.
Cette marche m'a gelée.
Oui, Madame.
J'ai d'excitantes nouvelles.
Nous partons à Paris !
Et je serai présentée au Roi.
Gouvernante ?
Qui a eu accès à mes appartements ?
Personne à ma connaissance, Madame.
Pourquoi ?
Ceci est un signe de prophétie.
Voici le Roi...
Voici la Reine...
et me voici, moi,
avec la tête tranchée.
Sa Grâce, le Duc de Suffolk.
Votre Grâce.
J'ai ordre de Sa Majesté
de vous bannir de la cour.
Il semble que vous l'ayez irrité.
Qui êtes-vous, M. Cromwell ?
Il me semblait le savoir...
mais un doute m'envahit.
Je suis exactement
comme Votre Grâce me voit.
Au service de Sa Majesté,
du mieux que je peux.
Quelqu'un m'a dit
que vous étiez un mercenaire.
J'ai vu quelques batailles,
durant ma jeunesse.
Comme Votre Grâce, je crois.
Mais je n'ai jamais été
un soldat d'aventure.
J'ai irrité le Roi,
mais pour une bonne raison.
J'en suis persuadé. Mais d'autres
auraient procédé différemment.
Comme vous ?
Je n'ai jamais eu le cran
de me disputer avec vous.
Du moins, jamais en ma présence.
Voici l'ordre.
Vous devez quitter la cour...
immédiatement.
J'ai ici, entre mes mains...
le serment que
tous les membres du clergé
ont fait au Pape,
au moment de leur ordination.
C'est d'un contraste évident
avec le serment
qu'ils ont porté devant nous.
Mes chers sujets...
Nous pensions que les membres
du clergé étaient nos sujets.
À présent, nous considérons
qu'ils ne sont qu'à moitié
... nos sujets.
Pour ne point dire qu'ils
ne le sont plus du tout.
Milords...
je demande à savoir
de qui étes-vous les sujets.
Ceux du Pape...
Ou les miens.
Sir George Strockwater, Votre Honneur.
Je suis content de vous voir.
Je sais que vous êtes un bon catholique,
qui ne craint pas d'exprimer sa pensée.
Tout homme doit
chercher la vérité, Votre Honneur.
Certainement.
Ces derniers temps, il semble
que moult d'entre eux ce sont
... enfermés...
dans le silence, ou pire,
agissent contre leur conscience.
Souvenez-vous de mes paroles, George.
Ces prochains jours seront déterminants
pour l'avenir de notre foi.
Quoi qu'en dise M. Cromwell,
qu'importe qu'il...
enrobe ses arguments de mots mielleux,
les effets sont les mêmes, il demande
que le clergé se soumette totalement
à la volonté du Roi
et à l'autorité laïque.
Dieu fasse qu'il ne réussisse pas !
Autrement, il n'y aura plus d'Église,
plus de religion, plus de...
vie spirituelle dans ce royaume.
Cromwell a lui-même,
violé la Sainte Vierge.
- Votre Honneur...
- C'est pour cela que je demande,
à vous et aux gens comme vous,
de rester fort et honnête.
Si vous le faites...
vous mériterez alors
la meilleure récompense de Dieu
et beaucoup d'honneur
pour votre personne.
Croyez-moi...
Le jour viendra où le Roi,
lui-même vous remerciera.
<i>Nous rendons grâce</i>
au règne du Roi.
Et nous demandons la bénédiction
divine pour lui et pour son peuple.
Mais en ce jour béni,
nous sommes contraints de dire
que certains des prêtres
de Votre Altesse sont,
ces derniers temps,
comme ceux de l'époque du Roi Achab,
dont la bouche a cité
un Dieu erroné et trompeur.
Ceci... est l'évangile du mensonge.
Ne craignant point de parler
de droits et de libertés des monarques,
qu'aucun Roi chrétien n'aurait osé,
ne serait-ce qu'envisagé.
J'implore Votre Majesté de cesser cela,
et de ne pas poursuivre le sentier
que vous semblez prendre.
Ou vous suivrez certainement Achab
qui a épousé cette catin de Jézabel.
Et vous aurez
assurément une fin tragique,
où les chiens boiront votre sang
comme ils l'ont fait avec Achab,
tel que Dieu le lui avait prédit...
Sortez-le d'ici...
Lâchez-moi, chiens !
Je suis un homme de Dieu !
Lâchez-moi !
Je suis un homme de Dieu. Lâchez-moi !
Vous, le frère éhonté,
vous allez vite connaître l'enfer,
si vous ne tenez pas votre langue.
Gardez vos menaces pour vos semblables.
Comme les alevins, nous ignorons
nos mères, car nous savons que
le chemin du paradis est
aussi bon par mer que par terre.
<i>Levez-vous pour le Roi !</i>
<i>Le Parlement est en session.</i>
Milords...
Vos Grâces...
Êtes-vous parvenus à une décision ?
Me rejetez-vous encore ?
Ou acceptez-vous
l'autorité de votre Roi ?
Votre Grâce...
Votre Majesté...
Voici...
la soumission du clergé...
à la volonté de Votre Majesté.
- Parfait.
- <i>Merci...</i>
- C'est fait.
- <i>Archevêque.</i>
L'Église est brisée.
Jamais je n'aurais cru
assister à cela en Angleterre.
Votre Majesté...
Grâce à cette loi,
les hérétiques sont libres
de se promener impunément
dans les rues de Londres.
Si je pouvais pleurer, je le ferais.
Des larmes de sang...
Sir Thomas More.
Sir Thomas...
Votre Majesté...
Je viens présenter ma démission
de mon poste de Chancelier.
Je demande à Votre Majesté
de m'autoriser
à me retirer de la vie publique.
Ainsi, je pourrai consacrer
le temps qu'il me reste
à préparer mon âme
et au service de Dieu.
Cette bourse contient
le grand sceau de ma fonction,
que je trouve, à présent,
trop pesant pour moi.
Je vous libère...
de bonne grâce.
Dans tout ce que vous
avez fait pour moi, Sir Thomas,
vous avez toujours été bon...
et serviable.
Aussi bien en privé...
que dans les affaires publiques.
Votre Majesté...
je promets sur mon honneur de...
ne jamais m'exprimer en public
sur les affaires de Votre Majesté.
Mais maintenant...
en privé, je dois vous avouer,
comme une personne qui a joui de
de l'amitié de Votre Majesté,
ma profonde conviction que...
si Votre Majesté se réconcilie
avec la Reine Catherine,
les divisions et les heurts
dans votre royaume
seront immédiatement guéris.
Voilà, je l'ai dit.
À présent, mes lèvres
sont scellées à jamais.
Thomas...
Je m'en tiens à votre promesse.
<i>Lady Elizabeth,
je viens sur ordre du Roi.</i>
M. Wyatt...
Où est Lady Catherine ?
Sa Majesté est en prière,
peut-être pour longtemps.
- On ne peut la déranger.
- On m'a chargé de lui remettre ceci.
- Qu'est-ce donc ?
- Lady Catherine a ordre
de restituer les joyaux officiels.
Lady Elizabeth...
- Que voulez-vous ?
- Vous savez ce que je veux.
Monsieur Wyatt,
je n'ai pas l'intention
de devenir votre maîtresse.
Ni celle d'un autre.
Je veux arriver vierge à mon mariage.
Mais je doute de me marier.
Je préfère devenir l'épouse du Christ.
Une nonne ?
Je ne le crois pas.
Vérifiez vos poches.
"Être à vos côtés
est mon désir le plus profond."
"Mais mon cœur espère
plus qu'il ne mérite."
"Quelques gouttes de grâce
éteindront mon feu ardent."
J'espère que tout est prêt
pour ma visite en France.
Oui, tout est prêt,
selon les vœux de Votre Majesté.
Le Roi François est très impatient
de revoir Votre Majesté,
et de signer ce nouveau traité d'amitié.
Et Lady Anne ?
Elle sera reçue avec tous les honneurs.
Je suis ravi de l'entendre.
Je veux le meilleur pour elle.
Je souhaite que
cette visite soit exceptionnelle.
Et rien ne doit la perturber.
Vous me comprenez ?
Je comprends... Parfaitement.
Et Sa Majesté de même.
Merci à vous, M. Smithen.
Ma chérie...
Votre Majesté, voici le jeune homme
dont je vous ai entretenu.
Mark Smithen.
M. Smithen. Lady Anne
m'a beaucoup parlé de vous.
Elle dit que vous jouez très bien.
Jouez-nous quelque chose.
Votre Majesté...
Je sais que le Duc de Suffolk a mal agi.
Mais croyez-vous qu'il soit
possible de lui pardonner ?
Si vous lui pardonnez aussi vite,
certains penseront
qu'il y a une part de vérité
dans ce qu'il a dit.
Oui, mais pour les réfuter,
leur répondre et montrer
la confiance que j'ai en vous,
je ferai une chose plus importante.
J'inviterai M. Wyatt
à nous accompagner en France.
Ainsi, nul ne pourra
m'accuser de jalousie ou...
... d'aviver les soupçons.
Mon amour, vous n'avez
aucune raison d'être soupçonneux.
Et vous n'en aurez jamais.
J'ai reçu une lettre très instructive
de notre ami Cranmer.
Il semble qu'à Nuremberg
le clergé a droit au mariage.
Et M. Cranmer en profite pleinement.
- Vous insinuez qu'il s'est marié ?
- Il semble.
Eh bien...
Il aurait mieux fait
de bâtir sa carrière ici
... que dans l'illégalité.
Pour l'instant,
le mariage du clergé est illégal.
Que voulez-vous dire ?
Vous voulez que les prêtres se marient ?
Je ne vous ai peut-être,
jamais exposé mes vues.
Contrairement à vous
et à d'autres, j'ai attaqué
les pratiques de l'Église catholique...
Ces pèlerinages
qui honorent des saints...
en rampant devant une croix...
L'adoration des prêtres...
Je n'ai jamais voulu les réformer.
Non.
Mon réel et unique intérêt...
est de les détruire.
Au contraire, M. le secrétaire,
je pense que l'on se comprend,
parfaitement.
Il y a autre chose.
Une chose cruciale doit être faite,
avant de nous rendre en France.
Qu'est-ce donc ?
Dites-le-moi.
Faites place à Lady Anne !
À tous les nobles, gentilshommes
et ceux que cette présente intéresse,
il plaît au Roi,
par cet acte,
de conférer à Lady Anne Boleyn,
à elle-même et à sa progéniture,
le noble titre de
"Marquise de Pembroke."
Et par la présente de lui concéder
une rente annuelle de 100 000 livres
pour le maintien de sa dignité.
Votre titre de noblesse.
Merci, Votre Majesté.
<i>Sa Majesté, le Roi,</i>
<i>et Lady Anne Boleyn,</i>
<i>Marquise de Pembroke.</i>
Votre Majesté...
Notre bien-aimé
Archevêque Warham.
Il est mort en paix.
Si cela est encore possible
par les temps présents.
Il aurait peut-être connu
la fortune au paradis,
avant qu'il n'assène
ce coup de grâce à l'Église.
Votre démission, Sir Thomas,
va nous mener à la ruine.
Je ne pouvais rien faire d'autre.
Nous avons failli et échoué.
À présent, tout ce que je veux,
c'est qu'on me laisse en paix.
À écrire et prier.
Nous avons encore un devoir à accomplir
pour le bien de la chrétienté.
- Quel qu'en soit le coût.
- Je n'en crains pas le coût.
Mais j'ai...
une aversion
pour les affaires publiques.
Elles ne m'intéressent plus.
Comme elles n'intéressent plus
Votre Grâce.
Maîtresse Darrow.
Je suis venue
vous restituer votre poème.
Vous ne pouvez restituer un poème...
ou un baiser...
ou une pensée.
Je suis désolée
que vous soyez malheureux.
"Ardent," comme vous dites.
Je suis sûre de n'avoir
rien fait pour cela.
Rien ?
Milady, vous êtes pleine de causes.
Vos cheveux...
Vos yeux...
Vos lèvres...
sont les raisons de mon désir.
- Je dois rentrer.
- Je sais que vous le devez.
Je sais.
Mais restez un moment.
Que faites-vous ?
Je vous donne une chance...
... d'être vénérée.
Ma belle Lady.
Margaret.
Ma chère fille...
S'il arrivait que je sois...
puni pour mes convictions...
Mais le Roi a autorisé votre congé.
Non, il est préférable d'y être préparé.
Je ne comprends pas.
Chérie...
Nous devons évoquer la question...
... du martyr.
Non...
Écoutez...
Car si je sais que
mon épouse et mes enfants
vont m'encourager à mourir
pour une cause juste,
je serais pleinement réconforté.
Et avec une joie immense, j'irais...
au-devant de la mort.
Je vous en prie...
Je vous en prie.
Père !
Qu'en pensez-vous ?
Elles sont toutes à la mode française.
Voici le Damascène
que vous m'avez offert.
Les aimez-vous ?
Je veux que vous soyez fier de moi.
Je le serai.
Et cela vous aidera.
Ce sont les joyaux
des Reines d'Angleterre.
Je les ai fait réajuster pour vous.
Je ne sais quoi dire.
Si, vous le savez.
Je vous aime.
Je vous aime de tout mon souffle,
de chaque fibre de mon être,
je vous aime et je suis vôtre.
Et je suis vôtre.
Attendez...
Vous avez été si gentil avec moi...
Laissez-moi être gentille...
avec vous.
Mon amour...
Mon amour.
- Vous allez accompagner le Roi ?
- Oui.
Envisagez-vous d'accomplir
notre mission là-bas ?
Si l'opportunité se présente.
Laissez-moi vous dire.
Si vous réussissait
à tuer la catin du Roi,
vous serez aimé de Dieu,
de Sa Sainteté, de l'Empereur,
et de tous les gens de foi d'Angleterre.
Et si je devais périr ?
L'Empereur s'occupera
de votre famille sur terre.
Et vous serez accueilli au paradis
par une fanfare d'anges.
<i>Territoires français
occupés par l'Angleterre.</i>
Mon cher frère.
Nous sommes ici
pour renouer notre amitié.
Et celle de nos deux nations.
Venez...
Réjouissons-nous !
Ceci...
est un splendide banquet, mon frère.
Mais... où est-elle ?
Où est Lady Anne ?
Elle sera parmi nous.
Je suis désolé que ma femme et ma sœur
aient changé d'avis sur leur rencontre.
Mais...
à quoi vous attendez-vous ?
Exactement.
Il me vient à l'esprit, mon frère,
que vous et moi
devrions nous entendre
sur Jean de Cluzet.
Comme...
Richard Cœur de lion...
Les guerriers de Dieu !
Et évidemment, cela fera
le bonheur de Sa Sainteté,
si nous nous engagions
à reconquérir la Terre Sainte.
Du moins...
nous serions nommés à la tête
de cette expédition, n'est-ce pas ?
Certainement.
Votre Grâce.
Je suis soulagé de vous voir revenu
dans les bonnes grâces de Sa Majesté.
Je serais ravi de vous inviter,
vous... et la Duchesse,
à dîner avec nous,
pendant notre séjour à Calais.
Je serais encore plus ravi...
de refuser votre invitation.
Milord.
Des rumeurs circulent que Votre Grâce
soutiendrait secrètement la Reine,
contre le Roi et sa grande affaire.
Pendant longtemps,
vous m'avez étonné
par votre totale indifférence
à la gestion et la politique du pays.
Alors, que vous est-il arrivé ?
J'ai grandi.
Maîtresse Boleyn !
Vous devez être excitée
de revenir en France,
après toutes vos aventures, ici.
Voyons Mark,
vous avez oublié que je suis
en deuil de mon pauvre mari.
Je ne le traiterai pas de "pauvre."
Mais mort, certainement.
- Et d'impuissant.
- Vraiment ?
Je suis impatiente
de chevaucher quelques...
jeunes étalons français,
pendant mon séjour.
Entre vous et moi...
moi de même.
C'est fascinant !
Je vous connais ?
Je ne trahirai jamais
le secret d'une femme.
Surtout d'une belle femme
qui doit, naturellement,
avoir un grand destin...
Soutenez-vous vraiment
mon mariage avec le Roi ?
Pour une seule raison :
Je hais l'Empereur.
Donc, tout ce qui peut lui déplaire,
comme le divorce de sa tante,
me satisfait d'une manière inimaginable.
Mais également,
car je vous sais amie de la France.
Nous pouvons donc faire affaire.
Mais y a-t-il autre chose ?
Cela ne me ressemble point
de dire cela, mais
peut-être nous
connaissons-nous assez pour.
Le fait est...
que la position que vous allez avoir
n'est pas chose facile.
Précisément, ceux
qui ne sont pas nés pour.
Il est plus difficile de tout avoir
que de ne rien avoir.
Si je n'étais pas né pour être Roi,
je n'aurais point
souhaité cela à ma personne.
J'ai vainement tenté de fuir
le feu qui m'incendie.
Mais, en regardant autour de moi,
tout me ramène vers lui.
Te souviens-tu dans le passé,
quand nous en rêvions ?
Te serais-tu imaginé cela, Mary ?
Pas le moins du monde.
Donc, la mère Catherine, c'est toi.
Je te promets,
et je ne peux le dire qu'à toi,
que la chose que j'ai tant espérée
s'accomplira ici.
Le Roi François s'est comporté
avec nous en frère.
Vous êtes magnifique.
À présent, mon amour,
pénétrez-moi.
Et nous aurons un fils.

[www.seriessub.com]
- Previously on The Tudors...
- We have received two newtters regarding
the King of England's Great
Matter. First is from the King,
urging the Curia to make
a final decision
on his annulment for the sake
of peace in England.
- Your Majesty has a new title:
Supreme Head of the Church,
as far as the Law of Christ
allows.
- I cannot condone this vision
of private belief. For me,
the Church is a living sign
of God's presence.
- And the second letter?
- From the Emperor, urging you
to prevent the annulment
and excommunicate the King.
- It's so hard when
we're to be married
but she's still here! You can't
have three people in a marriage!
Why can't you see that?
- The King demanded to know what
would happen if he married Anne
without the Pope's permission.
Only Boleyn supported him,
not even his friend Brandon.
- His Majesty commands that
you be gone from this place.
- Wherever I go,
I remain his wife.
- Their resistance really
stemmed from only one man.
You understand what's
expected of you?
- I do.
- If you betray us, I'll destroy
your entire family.
- Four men died of their pains.
Some people even blamed
the Lady Anne.
- Some people will blame her
for everything!
- Harry--
- The time for Harry is over!
- What of this girl,
the King's whore?
Why doesn't someone
just get rid of her?
- With her lust, she has seduced
and bewitched him. He considers
betraying his lawful wife.
- And you will assassinate
the Lady Anne?
♪
- And I say we continue
to insist
upon the Church's immunity
from secular interference;
and we shall continue
to insist upon it
because that immunity
was ordained by God.
[Audience murmuring]
And this immunity from secular
interference should extend
to the ordained priests and
servants of our Holy Church,
and they should be free
from the threat
of murder and harm,
by the use of poison...
[Applause]
...or any other foul means,
when their only crime
has been to obey God's law
and uphold the sanctity
of the Church.
[Applause]
I beg you to understand...
- The King can't allow this.
The vote is crucial.
One way or another,
he must break the Church,
now and for always.
[Bells tolling]
[People chattering]
- Hey, Mark.
- What is this, Mr. Wyatt?
It's Christmas!
The season of goodwill.
What's wrong
with everyone?
- There's no mirth this year
because everything is different.
- How?
- In case you hadn't noticed,
the Queen and her ladies
aren't here.
- Why should we all be sad
about that?
[Chuckling]
- You know what the French say:
a court without ladies
is like a garden
without flowers.
[Laughing]
- Lady Anne,
a Christmas present
from His Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- I've also had a great bed
made for you.
It's almost ready.
- Your Majesty, a present
from the Lady Anne.
- Boar spears.
- Made after the Biscayan
fashion, apparently.
- The best.
[Ladies gasping]
[Laughing]
Thank you, sweetheart.
- Another present
for Your Majesty.
- Come closer.
It's very fine.
Who sent it to me?
- Her Majesty
Queen Katherine, Your Majesty.
- I will not receive it.
Take it away!
[Sighing]
- Don't let her
spoil everything.
- Your Majesty, the Chancellor
Sir Thomas More.
- Sir Thomas.
- Majesty.
Mistress Anne.
I have a seasonal gift for you.
With your permission.
It reminds us of what
we have to celebrate.
- Thank you, Sir Thomas.
I will treasure this.
We must meet soon,
Thomas.
There's a great deal to do with
the business of management
of this kingdom.
There's still a great clamour
against the privileges
enjoyed by the clergy,
and their abuse of it.
Further measures will certainly
have to be taken.
- I look forward to consulting
with Your Majesty.
- Thomas.
Happy Christmas.
[Music and laughter]
- Your Majesty.
- Charles!
- Majesty.
- Happy Christmas.
- Happy Christmas.
- Game of tennis?
- Good idea.
May I speak with you honestly?
- I hope so.
- Are you really gonna marry
Mistress Boleyn? Whatever
the consequences,
whatever her history?
- Why do you ask, Charles?
What do you mean:
"whatever her history?"
- I have it on very good
authority that she and
Thomas Wyatt were once lovers.
Apparently she fornicated
with him on many occasions,
sometimes brazenly entering
his chambers at night.
- I've heard those rumours.
She denies it.
- Well, she would,
wouldn't she?
- I said she denies it!
Happy Christmas.
[Christmas greetings]
- How do you find the King,
Mr. Cranmer?
- I swear to you, Mr. Cromwell,
that he really is the kindest
of princes.
- I think you were born
at a happy hour,
for it seems, do or say
what you will,
His Majesty will always
take it at your hand.
- I am not so conceited
as to suppose I am
anything more to His Majesty
than a diligent servant.
- Your modesty does you honour.
But His Majesty clearly thinks
that you are destined
for better things.
Which is why
he has appointed you
his special envoy to the court
of the Emperor.
- He can't possibly do that!
What... what I mean is...
is, why me?
I... I am nothing, Mr. Cromwell.
- His Majesty trusts you
absolutely.
He knows that you understand
his Great Matter
better than anyone else,
and that you take his part.
You're in a better place
than most to represent him
at the Imperial court.
I'm sure that you'll be
a great success.
And on your way there,
you'll have a chance to visit
the city of Nürnberg.
The first city wholly run
by Lutherans and reformers.
A city free of ancient
superstitions and idolatry.
Free of Popery and
the abuses of the clergy.
I shall look forward
to your report.
- The Duke of Suffolk
has taken it upon himself
to repeat the gossip
about you and Mr. Wyatt.
- And do you believe
any of it to be true?
- If I did,
would I be walking
here with you?
- I suppose
you've banished the Duke
from court?
[Mysterious music]
- I've asked the French
ambassador to come and see me.
I want him to draw up a new
treaty of alliance with France.
To nullify the threat
against the Emperor.
- I'm glad. You know my
sentiments towards France.
But, forgive me...
what has that got to do with me?
- There is another reason
why I want to see him.
I intend to arrange a visit
to France for both of us.
I want to present you,
formally,
to King Francis,
but as my future wife
and the future
Queen of England.
- Oh, my God!
[Religious music, choir singing]
- Your Grace.
May we speak?
I am here to inform Your Grace,
as Archbishop of Canterbury,
that the King intends
to put a bill
before the new session
of Parliament.
- What does it concern,
Mr. Cromwell?
- In the first place,
it means to deny the Pope much
of the revenue he now receives
from the English Church.
It also means to lay indictments
against the privileges of
leading clergy in this country.
- Mr. Cromwell,
what could be the cause
of this further attack
upon our Holy Church?
- People can see for themselves
that the monasteries
are already sitting on a
great wealth, which could be
better applied elsewhere
for the good of the whole
commonwealth. For the good of
ordinary, hard-working people.
- This does not strike me
as an attack
against abuses.
But rather, an open attack
upon our faith...
[Coughing]
...and the faith
of our ancestors.
- If that is your judgement,
Your Grace, it is not mine.
Neither is it
the King's.
- Nan!
- Yes, Madam?
- Draw me a bath.
The walk has made me cold.
- Yes, Madam.
- I've got such exciting news.
We're going to Paris.
I'm going to be presented
before the King.
[Ominous music]
Nan!
Who has been in
the apartment today?
- Nobody, Madam.
Not to my knowledge.
Why?
- Here is a book of prophecy.
This is the King,
this is the Queen...
and this is myself,
with my head cut off.
[Footsteps approaching]
- His Grace the
Duke of Suffolk.
- Your Grace. I have
His Majesty's order
to banish you from court.
You have displeased him,
it seems.
- Who are you, Mr. Cromwell?
I feel like I should know,
but somehow I don't.
- I am exactly as
Your Grace finds me.
I serve His Majesty
to the best of my ability.
- Someone told me that you were
once a mercenary soldier.
- I saw some action in my youth.
As did Your Grace, I believe.
- But I was never
a soldier of fortune.
If I displeased the King,
it was in a good cause.
- I'm sure.
Although some
would argue otherwise.
- Like you?
- I would never have
the temerity to argue
with Your Grace.
- Not to my face anyway.
- Here is the order. You are
to leave court at once.
[All talking excitedly]
- I have here, in my hands,
the oath which all members of
the clergy swear to the Pope
at the time of their
consecration!
It is in clean contrast
to the oath they swear to us.
My beloved subjects...
We thought the clergy
were wholly our subjects.
But now we can see they are
only half our subjects...
if they are our subjects at all!
My Lords,
I demand to know,
whose subjects are you:
the Pope's
or mine?
[Murmuring]
- Sir George Throckmorton,
Your Honour.
- Sir George!
Very glad to see you.
I know you are
a good Catholic man
who has never been afraid
to speak his conscience.
- So, in truth, should
every man, Your Honour.
- Indeed. But these days,
it seems there are many
who can be bullied
into silence, or worse,
into acting against
their conscience.
Mark my words, George:
these next few days
will determine the future
of our faith.
Whatever Mr. Cromwell says,
however he dresses his
argument up with honeyed words,
the effect remains the same:
he is demanding
that the clergy submit
themselves totally to the King's
will and to secular authority.
God forbid he should
ever succeed!
If he does, there will be no
more Church, no more religion,
no more spiritual life
in this kingdom!
Cromwell might as well rape
the Blessed Virgin himself!
- Your Honour!
- That's why I'm asking you,
asking you and people like you,
to remain strong and true.
If you do,
then you will deserve
God's great reward,
and much worship will
come to you personally.
Believe me,
in time even the King himself
will thank you.
- We give thanks
for the reign
of the King's Grace,
and we ask God's blessing on him
and on his people...
But on this holy day,
we are obliged to say
that some of your Highness's
preachers are these days
too much like those
of Ahab's days,
in whose mouths was found
a false and lying spirit.
[People whispering]
Theirs is the gospel of untruth,
not afraid to tell of licence
and liberty for monarchs,
which no Christian king
should dare
even to contemplate!
[People clamouring]
I beseech Your Highness
to take heed,
not to pursue the path
you seem to be taking,
or you will surely
follow Ahab,
who married
the whore Jezebel,
and surely will incur
his unhappy end, that dogs
will lick your blood
as they licked Ahab's...
which God avert and forbid!
[Shouting and clamouring]
Unhand me, you dogs!
I am a man of God!
Unhand me!
Unhand me!
[Clamouring]
I am a man of God! Unhand me!
- You shameless friar!
You'll be sewn in a sack
and thrown into the Thames
if you don't speedily
hold your tongue.
- Keep your threats for
your fellow courtiers.
As for us friars, we take
no account of them at all,
since we know very well
that the way to heaven is
as good by water as by land.
[Cawing]
[Gavel pounding]
- All rise for the King!
[People whispering]
- Parliament
is in session!
- My Lords...
Your Graces...
Have you come
to a decision?
Do you still deny me,
or do you accept
the authority of your King?
- Your Grace.
- Your Majesty.
[Coughing]
[Coughing]
Here is...
the submission of the clergy...
to Your Majesty's will.
[People whispering]
- There.
- Thank you, Archbishop.
- They've surrendered.
The Church is broken.
- I never thought
I would live
to see this day
in England.
- Now, by act of Parliament,
heretics are free
to swan around the streets
of London without check.
- If I could weep,
Sir Thomas,
I would weep
tears of blood.
[Sighing]
[Door opening]
- Sir Thomas More.
- Sir Thomas.
- Your Majesty.
I come to offer my resignation
from my post as Chancellor.
I ask Your Highness
to allow me
to withdraw
from public life,
so that I may spend
what time remains to me
provisioning my soul,
and in the service of God.
In this bag I carry
the Great Seal of my office,
which I find now
too heavy to hold.
- I discharge you...
most willingly.
In everything you have done
for me, Sir Thomas,
you have always...
been good and gracious,
both in private
and in public affairs.
- Majesty.
I promise on my honour
that I will never speak publicly
of Your Majesty's Great Matter.
But now, in private,
I must confess to you,
as someone
who once enjoyed Your Majesty's
confidence and friendship,
my deepest belief that,
if Your Majesty saw fit
to be reconciled
with Queen Katherine,
the divisions and hurts
of your Kingdom
would at once be healed.
There. I've said it.
And now my lips
are forever sealed.
- Thomas!
I will hold you to that promise.
- Lady Elizabeth. I come
on the King's business.
- Mr. Wyatt.
- Where is
the Lady Katherine?
- Her Majesty is at prayer
and will be for a long time.
She cannot be disturbed.
- I am charged to deliver this.
- What is it?
- A command that Lady Katherine
return her official jewels.
Lady Elizabeth...
- What do you want?
- You know what I want.
- Mr. Wyatt, I have no intention
of becoming your mistress.
Nor anyone else's,
for that matter.
I shall be a virgin
when I marry, but I doubt
I shall marry at all. I would
rather be a bride of Christ.
- A nun? I don't think so.
Check your pocket.
"Would God thou knewest
the depth of my desire...
"Then might I hope, thou
nought I can deserve...
Some drops of grace would
quench
my scorching fire."
[Door opening]
[Festive music, laughter]
- I trust all
the arrangements
have been made
for my visit to France?
- Yes, everything is prepared
and ready, Your Majesty.
King Francis
is most eager to see
Your Majesty again,
and to sign with you a new
alliance of friendship.
- And the Lady Anne?
- She will be received
with all due honour.
- I'm very glad to hear it.
I only want
the best for her.
I want this visit to be special.
And I don't want
anything to spoil it.
Do you understand me?
- I understand. Completely.
And so does His Majesty.
[Applause]
- Thank you, Mr. Smeaton.
- Sweetheart.
- Your Majesty, this is
the young gentleman
I told you about:
Mark Smeaton.
- Mr. Smeaton.
The Lady Anne has told me
a lot about you.
She says you play very well.
Play something for us.
- Your Majesty.
[Snaps his fingers]
[Lively air]
- I know it was wrong
for the Duke of Suffolk
to say what he did,
but do you think it's possible
we could forgive him?
- If you forgave him
so quickly,
some people might think
that there was some truth
to what he said.
- Yes, but to refute them,
to answer the matter directly
and to show how much
I trust you,
I will do a more
important thing.
I will invite Mr. Wyatt
to come to France with us.
That way, no one can
accuse me of jealousy,
or the slightest
suspicion.
- My love, you have
no reason to be suspicious.
Nor will ever have.
- I've received a most
illuminating letter from
our friend Cranmer.
It appears that, in Nürnberg,
clergy are allowed to marry.
And Mr. Cranmer has taken
full advantage of that fact.
- You mean he got married?
- So it seems.
- Well, it won't do
his career much good here.
Being illegal.
[Chuckling]
- Well, it's illegal for
the clergy to marry now, yes.
- What are you saying?
You want priests
to be able to marry?
- Perhaps I have never fully
explained myself to you,
Your Lordship.
When, to you and to others,
I have attacked the practices
of the Catholic Church--
pilgrimages and the
worshipping of saints,
crawling to the cross,
veneration of priests...
I've never been interested
in reforming them.
No.
My real,
my only interest
is in destroying them.
- [Whispering]: On the contrary,
Mr. Secretary.
I think we understand
each other perfectly.
[Applause]
- There is
something else,
something very important,
which must be done
before we can
sail for France.
- What?
Tell me!
- Shh...
[Giggling]
- Make way for the Lady Anne.
Make way.
- To all and singular, as well
nobles and gentiles as others
to whom these presents
shall come, it is the King's
pleasure, by this patent,
to confer on the Lady
Anne Boleyn,
in her own right,
and on her offspring,
the noble title
of Marquess of Pembroke.
And also by this patent,
to grant her lands
worth 100,000
pounds a year,
for the maintaining
of her dignity.
- The patent of your nobility.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- His Majesty the King
and the Lady Anne Boleyn,
Marquess of Pembroke.
[Formal greetings]
- Corpus Domini nostri
Jesu Christi
custodiat tu in vitam aeternam.
Our dearly beloved archbishop
Warham.
- He died peacefully...
if one can say such
a thing at such a time.
- He is, perhaps, fortunate
to be gathered now into heaven,
before the final ruin
of the Church he loved
and served.
- You are resigned then,
Sir Thomas, to our ruin?
- I don't know what else
can be done.
We fought, and we failed.
All I want now is
to be left in peace.
To write and pray.
- Surely we have a duty still
to act in the interests
of Christendom,
whatever the cost!
- I have no fear of the cost.
But I have...
abjured the public realm.
It no longer interests me.
As it no longer interests
His Grace.
[Praying]
- Mistress Darrell.
- I came to give you
your poem back.
- You cannot
give a poem back.
Or a kiss.
Or a thought.
- I'm sorry that
you are unhappy.
Burning, as you say.
I'm sure I've done
nothing to cause it.
- Nothing?
My Lady, you are
full of causes.
Your hair...
your eyes...
your lips...
All are causes of my desire.
- I must go to Mass.
- I know you must. I know.
Stay a moment.
- Oh, what are you doing?
- Giving you a chance
to be penitent...
my beautiful, pious lady.
- Margaret,
darling daughter...
It might come to pass
that I could be held to account
for my beliefs.
- But the King allows
for your conscience...
- Nonetheless, it's better
to be prepared.
- I don't understand.
- Sweetheart...
We must discuss
the question of martyrdom.
No, no. Shh, shh...
Listen.
Because if I thought
my wife and children
would encourage me
to die in a good cause,
it would so comfort me,
that in great joy I would
merrily run to death.
Please.
Please.
[Sobbing]
- Oh, Father!
- What do you think?
They are all in the French
fashion.
[Chuckling]
This is the damask you gave me.
Do you like them?
I so want you to be proud of me!
- Oh, I will be.
And these will help.
These are the jewels
of the Queens of England.
I shall have them
reset for you.
- I don't know what to say.
- Yes, you do.
- I love you.
I love you with
my every breath.
With every fibre
of my being.
I love you
and I am yours.
- And I am yours.
- Wait!
You have been
so kind to me...
let me be kind to you.
My love...
My love...
- You are travelling with
the King to France?
- I am.
- Will you consider
carrying out your mission
while you are there?
- If there is a good
opportunity, yes.
- I tell you this:
if you succeed in killing
the King's whore,
you will be the beloved of God,
of His Holiness,
and of the Emperor--
and truly of all the faithful
people of England.
- And if I should die
in the attempt?
- Then the Emperor would look
after your family here on earth.
And you would be welcomed
into heaven,
by a fanfare of angels.
[Ceremonious music]
- My dearest brother.
- Mon frère.
Mon ami.
[Applause]
- Bienvenue.
We are here to renew
our friendship
and that of our two nations.
Come! Let us celebrate!
[Applause]
[Festive music, conversations]
- Santé.
This is a wonderful feast,
brother.
- Merci.
- But... where is she?
Where is the Lady Anne?
- She will be here.
- I am sorry my wife and sister
changed their minds about
meeting her.
But what do you expect?
Souvent femme varie,
bien fol qui s'y fie!
- Women are often variable.
Only madmen believe them!
- Exactement.
[Laughing]
I have it in mind,
brother,
that you and I
should make arrangements
for a joint crusade.
- Like... Richard Coeur de Lion!
- Absolument!
Warriors of God.
And of course, no one will be
happier than His Holiness
if we should commit ourselves
to reconquer the Holy Land.
- But still,
we would be joint leaders
in this venture. Yes?
[Laughing]
- Of course!
[Conversations in French]
- Your Grace.
I'm delighted to see you
returned to His Majesty's
good graces.
It gives me much pleasure
to invite you and the Duchess
to dine with us
while we are in Calais.
- Not as much pleasure
as it gives me
to refuse
your invitation.
My Lord.
- There are rumours
that Your Grace secretly
supports the Queen,
and are against the King
in this Great Matter.
And yet, for so long,
you took immense pride
in being totally indifferent
to the machinations and
politics of this world.
So what happened to you?
- I grew up.
- Mistress Boleyn! You must feel
so excited to be back in France,
after all your little
adventures here.
- Tut, Mark.
You ought to remember
that I'm still in mourning
for my poor husband.
- Well, I wouldn't have called
him poor. Dull, certainly.
[Laughing]
- And impotent.
- Really?
- I can't wait to ride
some young French stallion
while I'm here.
- Well, between
you and me,
neither can I!
[Exclamations]
- Ohh!
Magnifique!
[Applause]
She's ravishing.
- Bravo!
[Laughing]
[Applause]
- Qui êtes-vous?
Do I know you?
[Exclamations]
Ahh!
[Laughing]
La belle Anne.
[Applause]
♪
Cette époque où vous
et votre soeur
étiez demoiselles de compagnie
auprès de ma reine...
- Mm-hmm?
- Je m'en souviens
comme si c'était hier.
- Votre Majesté
est très gracieuse.
Mais il est des choses,
peut-être,
que votre Majesté
connaît à mon sujet...
je préférerais que vous
les gardiez secrètes
et qu'elles ne soient...
jamais mentionnées au Roi.
- Hmm...
Madame la Marquise,
I am a Frenchman.
I would never betray
the secrets of a woman,
especially a beautiful woman,
who must naturally have
a great many.
- Do you really support
my marriage to the King?
- Bien évidemment.
For one thing,
I hate the Emperor,
so that anything which
discomforts him,
like the divorce
of his aunt,
pleases me immeasurably.
But also, I know you are
a friend of France,
so... we can do business.
- But there is something else?
- Oui.
It is not my place to
say this, Madam, but...
perhaps we know
each other well enough.
The fact is, the station
you will be asked to occupy
is not an easy one...
especially to those
not born to it.
It is much harder to have
everything than to have nothing.
If I had not been
born to be King,
I would certainly not have
wished that fate upon myself.
Vous comprenez?
- Oui, oui, je comprends.
Majesté.
- I've tried to run from
the fire that burns me.
But when I look around,
there the fire still is.
- Hello, sister.
[Laughing]
When you remember how it was,
when we were here before--
could you ever have
imagined this, Mary?
[Chuckling]
- Not for all the world.
But then I am not
as clever as you.
- I promise you
-and I can tell only you-
that the thing
I have so longed for
will be accomplished here.
[Laughing]
[Wind howling, rain pouring]
[Thunder rumbling]
- I thought Francis behaved
himself rather admirably.
You looked beautiful.
[Thunder rumbling]
[Light, airy vocals]
[Rain pouring]
- Now, my love...
let me conceive.
And we will have a son.
<i>Précédemment...</i>
Je demande à savoir
de qui êtes-vous les sujets.
Ceux du Pape... ou les miens.
Voici la soumission du clergé
à la volonté de Votre Majesté.
L'Église est brisée.
Si je pouvais pleurer, je l'aurais fait.
Des larmes de sang.
Sa Majesté croit en vos aptitudes.
<i>Il vous a désigné son envoyé spécial
à la cour de l'Empereur.</i>
J'ai reçu une lettre de Cranmer.
À Nuremberg,
le clergé à droit au mariage.
M. Cranmer en profite pleinement.
<i>- Que voulez-vous ?
- Vous le savez parfaitement.</i>
Allez-vous vraiment l'épouser ?
<i>Des sources sûres disent
qu'elle et Wyatt étaient amants.</i>
- Elle les a démenties.
- Cela est compréhensible.
J'ai dit qu'elle les a démenties.
Et cette catin, "la pute du Roi" ?
Pourquoi personne
ne s'en est occupée ?
<i>Si vous réussissez,
vous serez aimé de Dieu,</i>
<i>de sa Sainteté, de l'Empereur,</i>
Des rumeurs prétendent
que vous soutenez la Reine,
- Alors que vous est-il arrivé ?
- J'ai grandi.
Je viens présenter ma démission
de mon poste de Chancelier.
<i>Je promets de ne pas
m'exprimer en public</i>
- sur l'affaire de Votre Majesté.
- Je m'en tiens à votre promesse.
Nous avons un devoir
à accomplir pour la chrétienté.
Quelqu'en soit le coût.
Je te promets que
ce que j'ai tant espéré,
<i>s'accomplira ici.</i>
À présent, mon amour, fécondez-moi,
et nous aurons un fils.
Sa Majesté vous ordonne
de quitter ce lieu.
Qu'importe où j'irai,
je demeure sa femme.
J'implore Votre Majesté
de ne pas poursuivre le sentier
que vous semblez prendre.
Ou vous suivrez certainement Achab,
qui a épousé cette catin de Jézabel.
Les chiens boiront votre sang.

THE TUDORS
Saison 2 - Épisode 3
Traduction : dmbmh
Relecture : Lucille
Milord Brandon requiert
votre présence ce soir, Sir William.
- Pennington !
- Ah, les Southwell...
Comment va votre maître, Boleyn ?
Lord Rocheford, je vous prie.
Sir William Penington, Southwell.
Et comment va
votre putain de maître Brandon ?
Continu-t-il à proférer des stupidités
et des termes désobligeants
à l'encontre de Lady Anne,
qui sera bientôt Reine ?
- Le Duc pourra vous le dire.
- C'est à vous que je parle.
Le Duc n'a rien à faire
de l'élévation de la catin du Roi.
Qui est une catin ?
- Laissez-moi passer.
- Pas avant de vous le faire payer.
Allez chercher le Duc, vite !
Mon Père, je demande votre protection.
Bien sûr, mon fils.
Baissez vos armes, Messieurs,
ceci est un lieu sacré.
Défendez-vous, Pennington.
Grand Dieu !
Vous jetez la honte sur les Boleyn.
Et vous offensez Dieu,
en vous battant en ces lieux.
Arrêtez !
Arrêtez tout de suite,
pour l'amour de Dieu.
Trop c'est trop...
Tu es fou, Richard, tu l'as tué.
Qu'y a-t-il ? Mon Dieu...
Ils l'ont tué !
- Assassins !
- Milord...
Milord, je vous conjure, au nom de Dieu.
un meurtre a déjà été commis.
Pourriture !
- Votre Grâce...
- Taisez-vous !
Vous êtes morts.
Milord, je vous en prie,
ceux qui tuent dans la maison de Dieu,
sont damnés au regard de Dieu.
Tout cela est votre œuvre, Boleyn.
Lady Anne ne veut pas être dérangée.
Qu'ont-ils tous à se bousculer
devant la porte de Lady Anne ?
Qu'y a-t-il, M. Wyatt ?
Ils préfèrent tous
le soleil levant au soleil couchant.
- Qu'écrivez-vous, en ce moment ?
- Une satire.
Vous trouvez cela amusant ?
Un côté amusant y est présent,
comme toute chose sérieuse.
Voici, par exemple, une nouvelle
qui va vous faire rire, Mark.
M. Cromwell vient de m'annoncer
ma nomination au Conseil Privé.
C'est ridicule.
Dans la vie, tout est ridicule.
Autrement, le bonheur est...
- la vanité humaine
- M. Wyatt.
- Savez-vous ?
- Non.
J'ai une incroyable envie de pommes,
comme jamais auparavant.
Depuis trois jours.
Des pommes...
Oui, de pommes.
Le Roi m'a dit que
c'est un signe de grossesse, mais...
j'ai dit que ce n'est rien de la sorte.
De quoi parle-t-elle ?
Des nouvelles de France ?
Aucune qui satisfasse Votre Majesté.
Malgré qu'il ait promis
de plaider votre cause auprès du Pape,
le Roi François n'en a rien fait.
Aucune importance.
Que peut-on espérer d'autre
du Roi de France ?
J'ai maintenant une bonne raison,
une très bonne raison,
de ne pas attendre la décision du Pape.
L'annulation de mon mariage
doit être immédiatement proclamée.
Votre Majesté
étant à la tête de l'Église,
vous-même, pourriez...
L'annulation devra être décidée
et proclamée par l'Église elle-même.
Représentée par
l'Archevêque de Canterbury.
Votre Majesté n'est pas sans ignorer
que le poste est toujours vacant.
Je sais exactement qui nommer.
M. Cranmer !
Oui.
- Votre commande d'Allemagne.
- Merci.
Si vous pouviez... Merci. Enfin.
Catherine...
C'est fini.
Vous êtes arrivée.
Je suis soulagée de vous voir, Thomas.
Je pensais que j'allais mourir.
C'est une façon incommode de voyager,
même pour une épouse illégale.
C'est fini.
Vous êtes arrivée.
Pardonnez-moi.
Alors...
voici l'Angleterre.
Voici l'Angleterre.
Ils veulent que Cranmer
devienne Archevêque.
J'ignore si le Pape connaît
la réputation de Cranmer ?
Dévolu corps et âme
à la cause des luthériens.
Il était l'aumônier des Boleyn.
Il devra faire un serment spécial,
jurer de ne pas se mêler du divorce.
Bien sûr qu'il s'en mêlera,
c'est ce qu'ils veulent.
Ils ne se préoccuppent plus
de la Sainte Église.
Même le peuple leur est indifférent.
Le Roi n'a de crainte qu'envers Dieu.
Je crains pour la Reine.
Anne Boleyn la déteste ouvertement,
ainsi que sa fille.
Elle a menacé la petite.
Ce sont des propos dangereux.
Pensez également
à la vie de vos propres enfants.
Qu'est-ce donc ?
C'est le Sublimis Deus, Saint-Père.
Rafraîchissez ma mémoire.
Il interdit l'esclavage
des indigènes du Nouveau Monde.
Nous le signons donc avec plaisir.
Car le fait est, Campeggio,
que les Rois d'Europe
sont puissants
mais dépourvus de moralité.
Je dois éveiller leur conscience.
Ce sont mes enfants désobéissants
et je suis leur père,
les guidant dans
les sentiers de la vertu.
Et que Dieu me vienne en aide.
Et ceci ?
Le Roi d'Angleterre
vous demande d'agréer
la nomination
de l'Archevêque de Canterbury
après le décès de l'Archevêque Warham.
Et les gens prétendent
que cela lui importe peu.
Quel est le nom du candidat ?
Thomas Cranmer.
Que savons-nous de lui ?
Pas grand-chose.
C'est un anonyme homme d'Église.
On prétend qu'il soutient
secrètement les luthériens.
Dans ce cas, nous ne saurions
approuver sa nomination ?
Non.
Je ne crois pas, Votre Sainteté.
Cependant...
nous voulons accorder
à l'Église d'Angleterre la chance
de revenir à sa première allégeance,
et à notre foi authentique.
Nous voulons faire plaisir au Roi.
Nous voulons qu'il nous soit redevable.
La meilleure façon pour cela,
est d'approuver
la nomination d'un inconnu.
Après tout,
quel mal un inconnu
peut-il infliger
à notre Sainte Église ?
Votre Grâce.
Nous sommes ravis de votre nomination.
Votre Majesté, je...
j'avoue avoir des scrupules pour cela.
Car je ne l'ai pas reçue
des mains du Pape.
Vous n'êtes pas redevable à Rome,
mais seulement à Dieu,
et à moi.
Et en tant que principale
autorité spirituelle de notre Royaume,
je vous demande de statuer,
une fois pour toutes,
sur ma grande affaire.
Mon premier mariage
est-il valide ou non ?
Majesté, j'en ferai
ma première préoccupation
et prononcerai mon verdict
dans les plus brefs délais.
M. Cromwell.
Majesté.
Depuis le départ de Thomas More,
l'Angleterre a besoin d'un Chancelier.
Je vous fais confiance
pour occuper ces fonctions.
Où est-il ? Où est Suffolk ?
Nous sommes réunis en ces lieux,
sous le regard de Dieu tout puissant,
pour unir par les liens du mariage,
cet homme et cette femme.
Promettez tous deux
que vous agirez justement,
avec sagesse et prudence,
clémence et authenticité.
Que Dieu vous vienne en aide.
Maître Brereton.
C'est inutile,
j'ai échoué.
Et je ne peux rester en ces lieux.
Alors, allez là où
votre cœur vous guide.
Avec la bénédiction de Dieu.
Milady ? Le Duc de Suffolk.
Votre Grâce.
Milady.
Je viens sur ordre de Sa Majesté.
Il m'a demandé de...
Il vous demande
de ne plus tenter de le revoir,
Puisqu'il est, à présent,
marié à Lady Anne.
De ce fait, il vous retire
le titre de Reine.
Vous serez désormais connu sous le nom
de Princesse douairière de Galles.
Il n'assurera plus vos dépenses.
Dans sa générosité, il vous permet
de garder votre propriété,
mais ne pourvoira pas
aux salaires de vos domestiques,
ni aux dépenses de votre demeure.
Et au sujet de ma fille ?
- Vais-je revoir Mary ?
- Madame...
Pardonnez-moi.
Savez-vous, M. Brandon ?
Si je devais choisir entre...
le bonheur extrême
et l'extrême tristesse,
je choisirais la tristesse.
Car lorsque vous êtes heureux,
vous oubliez...
les choses spirituelles,
vous oubliez Dieu.
Mais dans votre tristesse,
Il est toujours présent.
Que Dieu vous bénisse
et vous protège, Milady.
Tant que je vivrais
je serais pour toujours,
la Reine d'Angleterre.
- Deo gracias.
- Amen.
Des nouvelles me sont parvenues.
M. Cromwell va présenter
un nouvel acte au parlement.
L'acte de restriction de l'appel.
Et sous cette innocente
appellation se cache
- le dessein d'un renversement.
- Que dit cette loi ?
"Le Royaume d'Angleterre est un empire
gouverné par un chef suprême
en sa qualité de Roi
et ne prêtant allégeance qu'à Dieu."
À l'avenir,
toutes les décisions spirituelles
ne seront pas traitées à Rome
mais en Angleterre,
où le Roi est possesseur
du pouvoir suprème
et de toute autorité,
prérogative et décision.
Si je comprends bien, cela veut dire
que cette loi retire au Pape, le droit
de décider de l'annulation du mariage.
Et par là même, empêchera la Reine
de faire appel au Vatican
contre toute décision prise ici.
Exactement.
Aucun souverain anglais ne s'est
octroyé autant de pouvoir absolu.
- Pauvre Catherine.
- Pire...
Il y a des rumeurs disant que le Roi
a épousé Anne, en secret.
- Non...
- Et qu'elle serait déjà enceinte.
Vos Éminences,
à l'issue de ce tribunal
ecclésiastique
je suis disposé à prononcer
le verdict décidé par nous tous.
Il est déplorable
que certains aient refusé
de venir témoigner
mais cela ne fait
qu'enteriner notre décision.
Qui est... que l'union
entre le Roi Henry d'Angleterre
et Catherine d'Aragon
est déclarée nulle et non avenue.
De ce fait,
le mariage du Roi avec Anne Boleyn
est déclaré valide
et légal
au regard de Dieu.
Sir...
- Elizabeth.
- Je ne suis pas ici pour cela.
Que voulez-vous ?
Je viens pour le compte de Milady.
Mais sans sa permission.
Elle est dans un état déplorable.
Abandonnée et trahie...
Il est si... cruel
que le Roi l'ait humiliée de cette façon
en prétendant
épouser cette traînée.
Comment ?
Ne le saviez-vous pas ?
Le Duc de Suffolk est venu
lui annoncer que le Roi...
s'est marié.
Anne...
... Boleyn.
Que puis-je faire contre cela ?
Vous êtes membre du Conseil Privé,
et proche de M. Cromwell,
j'ai pensé que vous pourriez
intervenir en sa faveur.
Sachez que M. Cromwell n'aura jamais
de sympathie pour votre maîtresse.
Et vous ?
Si vous m'aimez encore, aidez-la.
Je suis désolé.
Étant le successeur de Saint-Pierre,
je condamne solenellement la séparation
du Roi d'Angleterre
avec Catherine d'Aragon
et son secret mariage,
que je déclare nul et non avenu.
Cette décision
de la validité du mariage de Sa Majesté,
ne pourra être décidée
que par cette cour,
celle-ci ne s'étant pas
encore prononcée.
Je laisse au Roi
jusqu'au mois de septembre
pour reprendre son épouse légitime,
sous peine d'excommunion.
Qui est une séparation
avec la Sainte Église,
avec la communauté,
et avec Dieu.
Merci Vos Excellences,
je vous prie de faire parvenir
mes mots à vos maîtres,
partout dans le monde.
Suivez-moi, Maître Brereton.
Saint-Père, voici le jeune anglais
dont je vous ai entretenu.
Il nous a informés
sur la cour d'Angleterre.
Maître William Brereton.
Mon fils.
Nous vous remercions pour les nouvelles
que vous nous avez apportées
sur ces terribles événements
et pour tous les efforts
faits pour les empêcher.
J'ai tenté d'atteindre mon but,
mais malheureusement, j'ai failli.
Qui sait, mon fils.
Les voies du Seigneur
sont impénétrables.
Le Cardinal Campeggio m'a dit
que vous vouliez vous établir à Rome
et ne pas retourner en Angleterre.
Est-ce vrai ?
Oui, Saint-Père.
Je préfère rester
sous l'étendard de la foi.
Écoutez-moi, Maître Brereton.
J'ai conçu un Saint Ordre
très particulier.
Ce sont les ecclésiastiques
les plus émérites.
Les soldats du Christ.
Ces jésuites, comme ils se font appeler,
ces soldats...
vont là où les autres ont peur.
Ils sont exposés à de grands dangers
afin de promouvoir la foi catholique
et de transmettre la voix de Dieu
aux impies et aux hérétiques.
J'ai eu à apprécier
votre passion pour cette cause
et je vous supplie...
de rejoindre cet ordre.
Rejoignez les croisades
contre l'hérésie.
Et repartez en Angleterre,
même si vous devez périr en martyr.
M. Cromwell.
Majesté.
Votre Majesté.
- Comment vont les préparatifs ?
- Parfaitement bien, Majesté.
Je veux que le peuple
aime sa nouvelle Reine
autant que je l'aime.
Et si je peux l'aimer,
pourquoi pas eux ?
Je peux vous assurer qu'ils l'aimeront.
Et ils auront
toutes les raisons pour cela.
Non, appelle-moi "ma sœur".
Comment vas-tu, ma sœur ?
Comment allez-vous ?
Nous allons tous les deux très bien.
Écoute...
Le Roi et moi avons rendu visite
à un célèbre astrologue.
Il a confirmé
ce qu'ont dit les médecins,
et que je savais au fond de moi.
Que c'est un garçon.
Le Roi est fou de joie.
Il veut le dire à tout le monde
mais je l'en ai dissuadé.
Pas pour l'instant, du moins.
Regarde tout cela.
M. Holbein a dessiné
tout genre de choses
pour le banquet du couronnement.
C'est si beau.
M. Holbein est vraiment un génie.
As-tu peur ?
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Ce n'est rien, je...
Qu'y a-t-il, mon époux ?
Je vais devoir assister le Roi
au couronnement de sa catin.
Wolsey lui avait donner un sobriquet.
"L'oiseau de mauvais augure."
Ne pouvez-vous pas
feindre une indisposition ?
Le Roi m'a nommé
Grand Prévôt à cette occasion.
Si je fais cela,
Sa Majesté me tranchera la tête
et je serai effectivement indisposé.
Parfait...
alors préservez votre tête,
qui est assez jolie, je dirais,
et dont j'ai, moi aussi, usage.
Mais cachez votre dévouement
et votre rage.
N'agissez pas avec impulsivité,
ce serait une erreur.
Un jour, si d'autres en font de même,
révélez vos sentiments.
Et si vous en avez l'opportunité,
mettez-la à terre,
et détruisez-la.
Oyez ! Oyez !
<i>Faites place pour Sa Majesté</i>
<i>Le Roi Henry et Lady Anne Boleyn,</i>
<i>Marquise de Pembrook.</i>
<i>Faites place ! Faites place !</i>
Où est la foule ?
Où sont les gens ?
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Il est mort... abattu.
Mon Dieu !
Poursuivez la procession.
Je ne puis.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Un accident.
Rien qui puisse intéresser
Votre Majesté.
Rien sur terre ne pourra
perturber cette journée.
<i>Viens, Ô Saint Esprit...</i>
<i>nous rendre visite...</i>
<i>Insuffle dans nos cœurs</i>
<i>la grâce que tu as créée.</i>
Seul, à travers toi...
nous reconnaissons le Père.
Que cela devienne notre foi perpétuelle,
que tu as hérité de lui.
Guide nos sens...
emplit nos cœurs d'amour,
diminu nos désirs charnels,
et renforce nos vertus, pour toujours.
Amen.
Attendez !
Laissez-moi faire.
Par ceci,
la couronne de St-Edouard,
je vous couronne solennellement,
Reine d'Angleterre.
Et ceci,
sont les deux sceptres de souveraineté.
Honneur...
et dévouement.
Soyez à présent notre Reine.
Soyez prospère.
Suivez votre destinée.
Et donnez naissance
à un fils de lignée royale.
C'était une tentative de meurtre.
Contre vous ou la Reine.
Un page a été tué.
Merci, M. Cromwell.
Mon amour.
Comment était-ce ?
La ville vous a-t-elle plu ?
- Était-ce à votre goût ?
- Tout était merveilleux.
Mais si peu de gens...
Certains sont restés couverts
lors de notre passage.
C'était plus des funérailles
qu'une parade.
Vous devez assister au banquet.
Je veux vous voir heureuse.
Je veux vous voir souriante.
Souvenez-vous,
à présent, vous êtes ma Reine.
Je sais.
J'ai dit...
Vous êtes ma Reine.
Tout le monde vous attend.
Je n'ai pas vu l'Évêque Fisher.
Non, Votre Majesté.
Et où est Sir Thomas More ?
Je ne l'ai pas vu non plus.
- N'a-t-il pas été invité ?
- Il l'a sûrement été, Majesté.
Il a donc choisi de ne pas y assister.
Ces dames ont faim.
Votre Grâce,
en votre qualité de Grand Prévôt,
les événements d'aujourd'hui
sont de votre faute.
Je veux savoir qui en est l'auteur.
J'ai déjà reçu mes ordres, Milord.
Je suis pleinement confiant,
Votre Grâce.
Je n'ai pas oublié Pennington.
Et je persiste à dire
que c'est de votre faute.
Levons nos verres pour les Boleyn.
Aux Boleyn !
Et à la nouvelle Reine d'Angleterre.
Au suivant.
Montrez-moi vos mains !
Enlevez vos gants !
Allez-y. Au suivant !
- Faites place !
- Montrez-moi vos mains.
Faites place !
Oh, Mary !
Tout cela pour moi !
<i>Comment était le couronnement ?</i>
C'était un événement froid,
chaotique et incommodant.
Et votre absence
a été remarquée, Sir Thomas.
Comment la Reine arrive-t-elle
à gérer tout cela ?
Je ne suis plus autorisé à la voir.
Et il est de plus en plus
difficile de lui écrire.
Je vais tenter de la voir.
Ce serait périlleux.
Vous risquez la prison,
rien qu'en parlant en sa faveur.
Je ne serai pas le dernier.
Je me remémore le passé.
Je pensais que le Roi était
le prince le plus prometteur
de la Chrétienté.
J'étais persuadé que son règne
serait un âge d'or.
Tant d'espoir en vain.
L'Évêque Fisher a été
assigné à résidence,
Faites attention à vous, Eustace.
Vous serez honorables, discrets,
précis et mesurés dans votre conduite.
Vous offrirez aux autres
un visage pieux.
Soyez présents quotidiennement,
et affichez un aspect vertueux.
Sous peine de renvoi immédiat
et de bannissement,
vous ne devrez pas vous quereller,
jurer,
ou tenir des propos
malveillants ou grossiers.
Ni avoir un comportement grossier.
Vous serez un exemple
pour tout le monde.
Comprenez-vous ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Et vous, ne fréquentez pas
les maisons closes.
Je garderai ici
une copie de la bible anglaise
de Tyndale.
Vous êtes tous libre de la consulter
et de vous en inspirer.
Car les vieux jours sont révolus.
Tout va changer, à présent.
Grâce à Sa Majesté,
vous êtes tous libérés
de l'obscurité
et de l'esclavage du Pape,
de l'idolâtrie et des superstitions.
Ceci est un nouveau commencement.
Pour moi,
pour vous,
et pour l'Angleterre.

Sir...
Lady Mary...
Je viens vous informer sur le jugement
auquel est parvenu
l'Archevêque de Canterbury.
Le mariage de Sa Majesté avec
votre mère est déclaré nul et non avenu.
Votre mère n'étant plus Reine
elle doit accepter le titre
de Princesse douairière.
Vous même, n'ayant plus le droit
d'être appelée princesse,
serez connue dès maintenant
sous le nom de Lady Mary.
De plus,
le mariage de Sa Majesté
avec la Reine Anne,
a été déclaré légal et valide.
Son couronnement a eu lieu à Londres,
la semaine dernière.
Je ne connais de Reine d'Angleterre
que ma mère,
et n'accepterai d'autre Reine
que ma mère.
Dans ce cas, je dois vous dire
qu'il vous est interdit
de communiquer avec votre mère.
Puis-je lui écrire ?
Pas même un mot d'adieu,
étant donné votre...
... intransigeance.
Sir Thomas More, Milady.
Sir Thomas.
Majesté.
Pardonnez-moi
de vous recevoir de la sorte,
mais je me sens souffrante.
Ce qu'on vous inflige
est connu de nombreuses personnes,
ici et outre-mer.
Aussi bien son aspect injuste.
que l'honorable façon
que vous avez de l'endurer.
Il semblerait...
que je doive cesser
de me faire appeler Reine.
Même si j'ai été couronnée
et consacrée.
Ils disent qu'en cas de refus,
le Roi retirera
son amour paternel à ma fille.
Je ne m'en remettrais pas.
Tant pour le bien de ma fille,
que pour celui de
n'importe qui d'autre.
Je concède des milliers de choses
pour apaiser mon âme,
ou celle de mon époux...
le Roi.
Je vous en prie,
pardonnez-moi encore, Sir Thomas, je...
... ne reçois plus beaucoup de visites.
Elles me sont
pour la plupart interdites.
Comment y avez-vous été autorisé ?
J'ai écrit à M. Cromwell.
Vous êtes un brave homme.
Autrement, j'aurais été lâche.
Je ne peux plus prétendre être...
indifférent à ces événements.
J'encourage vos appuis
au parlement et ailleurs,
à parler selon leur conscience,
et à se tenir à vos côtés.
Merci.
Sir Thomas, merci.
Majesté.
Anne...
Mon amour.
Je ne peux pas. Pas maintenant.
Pour le bébé.
Elle est exquise, n'est-ce pas ?
Lady Eleanor Luke.
Sa famille a un domaine à Oxfordshire
Dois-je aller lui parler en ton nom ?
Comment trouvez-vous la vie à la cour ?
Je me sens...
- Doublement chanceux, Milord.
- Doublement ?
D'abord, pour avoir été
autorisé à venir ici.
Et secondairement pour le patronage
de votre famille.
Nous aimons accueillir les artistes,
et les hommes de talents.
Le peintre Holbein a vécu parmi nous.
Ma sœur soutient de nombreux musiciens.
Oui, votre sœur est vraiment...
une artiste talentueuse.
Et une très belle jeune femme.
Même si...
Même si ?
Elle n'est pas aussi belle
que son frère.
Qu'est-ce cela ?
La décision finale de la curie de Rome.
Ils se prononcent pour Catherine.
Ils déclarent mon mariage invalide
et tout enfant conçu de ce dernier
... illégitime.
Le Pape menace de m'excommunier,
si je ne revenais pas à Catherine.
C'est trop tard.
Calmez-vous...
Calmez-vous...
Courage...
Il arrive...
Et je veux que vous organisiez
joutes, banquets et bal masqué
pour fêter la naissance de mon fils.
Je n'arrive pas à trancher entre Henry
et Édouard.
J'ai demandé à l'Ambassadeur de France
de le tenir lors de son baptême.
S'il tombe, ce sera la guerre !
Il arrive Anne, il arrive.
Poussez.
Poussez !
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Rien...
Votre Majesté a donné naissance
à une très jolie petite fille.
Et n'avez-vous pas
trouvé cela choquant ?
Votre Majesté, je suis vénitien,
je viens d'une ville
où tous les hommes sont joueurs,
et toutes les femmes des catins.
Qu'y a-t-il de choquant à cela ?
Majesté.
Je suis désolée.
Nous sommes jeunes.
Et par la grâce de Dieu,
un garçon suivra.
- Lady Eleanor.
- Majesté.
- Jouez-vous aux échecs ?
- Oui, Majesté.
Alors, jouons.
C'est mon premier déplacement.

<i>Previously on "The Tudors"...</i>
I demand to know whose
subjects are you:
The pope's, or mine?
Here is submission of the
clergy, to your majesty's will.
- The church is broken.
- If I would weep, sir thomas, I would weep
tears of blood.
His majesty clearly thinks that
you are destined for better things.
Which is why he has appointed you his
special envoy to the court of the emperor.
I've received a letter
from our friend Cranmer.
In Nurnberg, clergy
are allowed to marry.
And mr. Cranmer has taken
full advantage of that fact.
- Lady Elizabeth.
- What do you want?
You know what I want.
Are you really going to
marry mistress Boleyn?
I have it on very good authority that
she and Thomas Wyatt were once lovers.
- She denies it.
- Well, she would, wouldn't she?
I said she denies it!
What of this girl,
the king's whore?
Why doesn't someone
just get rid of her?
If you succeed, you will
be the beloved of god,
of his holiness,
and of the emperor.
There are rumours that your grace
secretly supports the queen.
- So what happened to you?
- I grew up.
I come to offer my resignation
for my post as chancellor.
I promise that I will never speak
publicly of your majesty's great matter.
I will hold you
to that promise.
We have a duty still to act in
the interests of christendom.
Whatever the cost.
I promise you that the thing I have so
longed for will be accomplished here.
Now, my love, let me conceive.
And we will have a son.
His majesty commands that
you be gone from this place.
Wherever I go,
I remain his wife.
I beseech your highness not to pursue
the path you seem to be taking.
Or you will surely follow Ahab,
who married the whore Jezebel!
The dogs will lick your blood!

The Tudors - Season 02
Episode 03
- Pennington!
- Ah, the Southwells!
How's your master, Boleyn?
That's Lord Rochford
to you, Pennington.
Sir William Pennington
to you, Southwell.
And how is your master?
Master fucking Brandon?
Does he still persist in using the
most foul and abusive language
against my master's
daughter, Lady Anne.
- who is soon to be queen?
- The duke can speak for himself.
I'm asking you, Pennington!
His grace wants nothing to do with
the elevation of the king's whore!
Who's a whore?
- Let me pass!
- Not till you've paid for that.
Run! Fetch the duke! Go!
Father, I seek sanctuary
in this place.
Of course, my child.
Put up your swords, gentlemen.
This is a place of god.
Defend yourself, Pennington.
Dear god!
You dishonour the Boleyn
family whom you serve.
And you offend god by
offering violence here.
Stop it.
Stop now, for the
love of god!
Enough is enough!
You fool, Richard.
You've killed him!
Oh, my lord.
They've killed him.
Murderers!
Oh my lord, my lord, I beg
you, in the name of our lord.
One murder has been
committed here already.
You scum.
- Your grace, we...
- Shut up!
- You're both dead men.
- My lord, listen! I beg you.
Those who commit murder in church
are damned in the eyes of god.
This is your doing, Boleyn!
Lady Anne is not
to be disturbed.
Suddenly everyone is beating
a path to Lady Anne's door!
Why do you suppose
that is, mr. Wyatt?
Because everyone prefers a rising
sun to a setting sun, mr. Smeaton.
Now tell me, what are
you writing at the moment?
A satire.
You find all this funny?
Well, it has its funny side,
like all serious things.
For example and this will
make you laugh, Mark.
Mr. Cromwell just told me I've been
appointed to the privy council.
That's ridiculous.
Everything in
life is ridiculous.
And to suppose
otherwise is...
- It's human vanity.
- Mr. Wyatt.
My lady.
- You know what?
- No, I don't
I have a furious
hankering for apples,
such as I've never had before.
It started three days ago.
Apples?
Yes! Apples.
The king told me it was a
sign I was pregnant, but
I said it was
nothing of the sort.
What was that about?
What news from france?
None to give your
majesty any satisfaction.
Although he promised to make representations
to the pope on your majesty's behalf.
King Francis did no such thing.
It doesn't matter.
What else should we have expected
from the king of France?
The fact is, I now have a good
reason... a very good reason,
not to wait for the pope's decision.
The annulment of my marriage
must be declared immediately.
Well, as your majesty is
head of the church now,
- you yourself could...
- No.
The annulment should still be decided
and declared by the church proper.
That is to say,
the Archbishop of Canterbury.
As your majesty knows, there
remains a vacancy for that position.
I think I know exactly who will suit.
Mr. Cranmer!
Yes.
- Your belongings from Germany.
- Thank you.
If you could just...
thank you, sir. At last.
Katharina.
It's over now.
You're here.
I'm very relieved to see you, Thomas.
I thought I was going to die!
It's not the nicest way to travel,
even for an illegal wife!
It's over now.
You're here now.
Do you forgive me?
So...
This is England?
This is England.
They want to make
Cranmer archbishop.
I wonder if the pope knows of
the reputation Cranmer has here
for being devoted heart and
soul to the lutheran movement.
He was once chaplain
to the Boleyns.
He ought to be required to take a special
oath not to meddle with the divorce.
Of course he'll meddle!
That's what they want!
They don't care about
holy curch anymore.
They don't even care
about the people.
The king, in his blindness,
fears no one but god.
I fear for the queen.
They say Anne Boleyn hates her
openly and her daughter, too.
She's made threats
against the child.
Those are
dangerous words.
Think also of the lives
of your own children.
What is this?
The bull "Sublimus Dei", holy father.
Remind me.
It forbids the enslavement of the
native peoples of the new world.
Then we sign it very willingly.
For the fact is, Campeggio,
that the kings of europe
have power but no morality.
I must act as
their conscience.
They are my wilful children
and I their father,
leading them along the
paths of righteousness.
So help me god.
And this?
The king of England asks your approval
to appoint a new archbishop of Canterbury,
after the death of
archbishop Warham.
And people say
he doesn't care!
- What is the name of the candidate?
- Thomas Cranmer.
What do we know of this Cranmer?
Virtually nothing.
He's an obscure cleric.
A nobody.
There are strong rumors that
he is a secret lutheran.
Then we should not approve
his appointment.
No. Not in my opinion,
holiness.
And yet...
we want to give the english church
the opportunity to return
to its first allegiance,
and our true faith.
We want to please the king.
We want to make
him beholden to us.
What better way to please him than to
approve the appointment of a nobody?
After all,
what harm can a nobody
inflict upon our holy church?
Your grace.
We are most pleased to see
you confirmed as archbishop.
Your majesty, I confess I had some
scruples about accepting the office,
since I must receive
it at the pope's hand.
You are not beholden to Rome.
Only to god. And me.
And now, archbishop, as principle minister
of spiritual jurisdiction in our realm,
I ask you to determine
once and for all,
my great matter.
Whether or not my first
marriage was valid.
Majesty, I shall address the
question with the greatest urgency,
and presently pronounce my verdict.
- Mr. Cromwell.
- Majesty?
Since the departure of Thomas More,
England has lacked a chancellor.
I am trusting you to
fill that office.
Majesty.
Where is he? Where's Suffolk?
We are gathered here together,
in the sight of god almighty,
to join in holy matrimony,
this man and this woman.
And will you both answer that you will
keep all these coming days rightful,
with rightwiseness and
discretion, with mercy and truth.
So help you god.
Master Brereton.
It's no use. I failed.
And I can no longer
bear this place.
Then go where your heart tells you.
With god's blessing.
- My lady...
- The Duke of Suffolk.
Your grace.
My lady...
his majesty has ordered me here.
He's asked me to tell you...
He warns you not to try
to return to him...
since he is now married
to the Lady Anne.
From henceforth, you must substain
from using the title of queen.
You will now be referred to as
the princess dowager of Wales.
You must also cut your
household expenses.
In his generosity, the king
allows you to keep your property,
but will no longer pay
your servants' wages,
or your household expenses.
And what of my daughter?
- What of Mary? May I see her?
- Madam.
Forgive me.
You know something, mister Brandon?
If I had to choose between extreme
happiness and extreme sorrow...
I would always choose sorrow.
For when you are
happy you forget...
you forget about spiritual
things; you forget about god.
But in your sorrow...
he is always with you.
May lord bless you and
keep you, my lady.
As long as I live,
I will call myself
the queen of England.
- Deo gracias.
- Amen.
Your grace, I have some news.
I have learned that signor Cromwell is
to present another bill to parliament.
The act of restraint of appeals.
And under its innocuous title does it
conceal its most revolutionary intent.
What does it say?
"This realm of england is an empire,
"governed by one supreme head and king,
and owing no allegiance
except to god."
In future, all final appeals on spiritual
matters will be heard, not in Rome,
but in England, where the
king will now enjoy...
"plenary, whole and entire power, pre-eminence,
"authority, prerogative and jurisdiction."
Which means, I take it,
that the act prohibits the hearing of
the king's nullity suit by the pope.
And, by the same token,
bars the queen
- from appealing to the vatican against
any decision made here. - Exactly.
No english sovereign has ever
been granted such absolute power.
- Poor Katherine.
- It's worse.
- There are rumours that the king
has married Anne in secret. - No!
And that she is already with child.
Your eminences. At the conclusion of this
properly constituted ecclesiastical court,
I am ready to pronounce the
verdict agreed by us all.
It is a pity that certain persons
refused to come here and testify!
But that in itself holds no
bearing upon our conclusions.
Which are: That the union
between king Henry of England
and Katherine of Aragon is
declared null and void.
And therefore, that the king's marriage
to Anne Boleyn is declared both valid
and lawful, in the eyes of god.
Sir.
- Elizabeth?
- Not that.
- Then what?
- I came on behalf of my lady,
though not with her permission.
Thomas, she is in a
most wretched way...
abandoned and betrayed.
It seems so cruel of the king
to humiliate her in every way,
pretending to marry that Harlot...
What?
Did you not know?
The duke of Suffolk came to tell
her that the king has married...
Anne?
Boleyn?
But what can I do
about any of that?
You are now a privy councillor.
And a client of mister Cromwell. I thought
you could speak up for my mistress.
Mister Cromwell is the least likely
man to sympathise with your mistress.
You must know that, Elizabeth.
But what about you?
If you still have feelings for me,
you will speak out for her.
I'm sorry.
As the successor of st. Peter,
I do solemnly condemn the separation of the
king of England from Katherine of Aragon,
and his subsequent secret marriage,
which I declare null and void.
This matter,
of the validity of his
majesty's marriage,
can only be decided by the curia,
which has not yet reached its conclusion.
I will give the king until september
to take back his former wife...
on pain of excommunication,
which is separation
from holy church,
from communion,
and from god.
Thank you, your excellencies.
You may communicate my words
to your masters everywhere.
Come with me, master Brereton.
Holy father, this is the young english
gentleman I was telling you about,
who brought us the news
from the English court.
Master William Brereton.
My son.
We are grateful to you for bringing
news of these terrible events
and for all you tried
to do to prevent them.
I tried to rid you of her, but
unfortunately, holy father I failed.
Who knows, my son? God
works in mysterious ways.
Cardinal Campeggio tells me you want to stay
in Rome now, and not return to England.
Is that correct?
Yes, holy father.
I would rather remain with
the flock of the faithful.
Recently, master Brereton,
I have ordained a new and
very special holy order.
They are the militantis ecclesiae.
the soldiers of christ.
These jesuits, as they are
called, these soldiers,
will go where others fear,
where often they will
meet great danger,
in order to promote the catholic faith
 and take the word of god
to heathens and heretics.
I see already your passion for
this cause, and I beg you,
join the order,
join the crusade against heresy,
and return to England,
even at the risk of martyrdom.
- Mister Cromwell.
- Majesty?
How are the preparations
for the coronation?
They're going well, majesty.
I want the people
to love their new queen
as I love her.
And if I can love her,
why shouldn't they?
I assure your majesty
they will love her,
and shall have every reason to do so.
Yes, I like it.
Madame la marquise.
No. Just sister.
How are you, sister?
How are both of you?
We are both very well.
Listen. The king and I have
visited a famous astrologer,
who confirmed what the physicians say,
and what I know in my heart:
That it's a boy.
The king is overjoyed.
He keeps wanting to tell people,
but I tell him not to.
Not yet anyway.
Come and look at these.
Mr. Holbein has been designing all kinds
of things for the coronation procession.
They're so beautiful.
Mr. Holbein is indeed a genius.
Are you scared?
Anne? What is it?
Oh, it's nothing. It's...
what's wrong, husband?
I'm going to have to attend on the king
and that bitch of his at her coronation.
What did Wolsey used to call her?
The black crow!
Can you not plead some indisposition?
I could...even though the king
has made me high constable for the day.
But if I did, his majesty would remove my head,
and then I should be genuinely indisposed.
Very well.
So keep your head.
It's a pretty head, in any case,
and I don't want to lose it either.
But store up your
knowledge and your anger.
Don't act impulsively,
it's always a mistake.
But one day, with others so
disposed, use them both,
and if you can,
bring her down and destroy her.
Hear ye, hear ye!
Make way for his gracious majesty,
King Henry, and the Lady Anne Boleyn,
Marquess of Pembroke!
Make way, make way!
Where are the crowds?
Where are the people?
- What the hell happened here?
- He's dead! Shot!
My god! Keep the procession moving.
I can't!
- What was that?
- An accident.
Nothing for your majesty
to be concerned about.
For nothing on earth
is going to spoil this day.
Veni, creator
spiritus mentus tuorum  visita.
Imple superna gratia
quae tu creasti pectora.
Tu septiformis munere,
digitus paternae dexterae;
tu rite promissum patris,
sermone ditans guttura.
Accende lumen sensibus
infundem amorem cordibus
in firmans nostri corporis
virtute firmans perpeti.
Amen.
Wait!
Give it to me.
With this,
St Edward's crown,
I do solemnly crown you
queen of England.
And here...
are the two sceptres of the sovereign.
Honour
and grace
be to our queen Anne. May you prosper,
go forward,
and may you bear a new
son of the king's blood.
That was an assassination attempt.
either upon you or upon the queen.
- A groom was killed.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you, mr. Cromwell.
Sweetheart. How was that?
Did you like the city?
- Was not everything well done?
- Yes, it was beautiful.
But so few people!
And they kept their hats on
their heads. And no one shouted.
It was more like
a funeral than a parade.
You have a party to go to.
I want you to be happy.
I want you to smile.
Remember: You are my queen now.
I know.
- But...
- I said:
You are my queen.
Everyone is waiting for you.
I don't see Bishop Fisher here.
No, your majesty.
And where is sir Thomas Moore?
I don't see him here either.
Was he not invited?
He was most certainly invited,
your majesty.
Then he chose not to attend.
Hungry, ladies?
Your grace.
Since you were appointed
high constable today,
what happened in the
procession was your fault.
I want to know who fired that shot.
I am already endeavouring
to find out, my lord.
Oh, I sincerely trust
that you are, your grace.
I have not forgotten Pennington.
For I feel that was your fault.
Here's to the Boleyns.
The Boleyns!
And England's new queen!
Oh, Mary! And it's all for me!
How was the coronation?
It was a cold, meagre
and uncomfortable thing.
And your absence
was noted, sir Thomas.
How is her majesty
bearing up under all this?
I am no longer allowed to see her.
And it is increasingly difficult
for us to exchange letters.
I'm going to try and see her.
That would be so dangerous.
Even to speak a word in her
praise is to risk imprisonment.
Nevertheless.
I have been thinking
about the past,
when I believed the king
to be the most enlightened
and promising prince in christendom.
I was sure his reign
would be a golden age.
I had such high hopes...
Bishop Fisher has been
placed under house arrest.
You should beware yourself, Eustace.
You will all be honourable, discreet,
just and thrifty in your conduct.
You will present a
godly spectacle to others,
attend mass daily and
display a virtuous demeanour.
On pain of instant
dismissal and banishment,
you must not quarrel,
swear...
or say evil and lewd things.
Nor ever behave lewdly.
You will set a standard
for everyone else.
Do you understand?
Yes, your majesty.
And you don't go to brothels.
I will keep here a copy
of Tyndale's english bible.
All of you are free to read it, and
draw spiritual nourishment from it...
for the old days are gone.
Everything is changed now.
Thanks to his majesty,
you have all been delivered
from the darkness and bondage
of papal thraldom, idolatry and superstition.
This is a new beginning.
For me. For you.
And for England.
Sir.
Lady Mary,
I have come to inform you
of the judgements made recently
by his grace, the archbishop
of canterbury.
His majesty's marriage to your mother
has been declared null and void.
Your mother was never legally
queen of England,
and must now accept the title
of dowager princess.
Just as you have no longer the
right to call yourself princess,
but from now on must be known
to all as lady Mary.
At the same time, his majesty's
recent marriage to queen Anne
has been declared
legal and valid.
Her coronation took place
in london this past week.
I know of no queen of England
save my mother.
And I will accept no other
queen, except my mother.
In which case, I have to tell you that
you are forbidden to communicate
in any way with your mother,
from this day forward.
May I not even write to her?
Not even a farewell note,
considering your...
intransigence.
Sir Thomas Moore,
my lady.
Sir Thomas.
Your majesty.
Forgive me for
receiving you like this,
but I do not feel well.
What you suffer is known to a great
many people, both here and abroad.
As is the injustice of it, as well as
the grace with which you endure it.
Now it seems...
I must cease to call myself queen...
Even though I was crowned so,
and anointed.
They say that if I refuse,
the king will withdraw his
fatherly love for my daughter.
I shall not yield,
neither for my daughter's sake
or anyone else's.
Not for a thousand deaths
would I consent to damn my soul,
or that of my husband the king.
Please forgive me again, sir Thomas.
I am not very used to visitors any more.
They are mostly
forbidden me.
How did you get
permission?
I wrote to mr. Cromwell
personally.
Then you are a brave man.
I'd be a coward
to do otherwise.
I cannot pretend to be detached
from these events.
I have been encouraging
your supporters in parliament,
and elsewhere,
to speak their minds
- and stand up for you.
- Thank you.
Sir Thomas. Thank you.
Majesty.
Anne...
sweetheart.
I can't. Not now.
While the baby...
Exquisite, isn't she?
Lady Eleanor Luke. Her family
has an estate in Oxfordshire.
Shall I talk to her
on your behalf?
Naturally.
How do you like life
at court, Mark?
- I feel... I feel twice fortunate, my lord.
- Twice?
Once for being allowed
to come here,
and twice for the patronage
of your family.
We like to
patronize artists.
Men of talent. The painter
Holbein stayed with us,
and my sister supports
many musicians and choirs.
Yes, well, your sister is quite
a talented musician herself...
as well as a very beautiful
young woman.
- Even though...
- Even though...?
Not as beautiful
as her brother.
What's this?
The final decision
of the curia in Rome.
They have found for Katherine.
They declare my new marriage invalid, and
any children produced from it, illegitimate.
The pope threatens
to excommunicate me
if I do not return to Katherine.
He's too late.
Hold on
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on
How brave!
Here it comes.
And I want you to organize jousts, banquets
and masques to celebrate the birth of my son.
I can't decide whether
to call him Henry or Edward.
And I've already asked the french ambassador
to hold him at the font during his christening.
If he drops him, it's war.
It's here, it's here.
Push! Push.
- What is it? What's happened?
- Nothing! Nothing!
Your majesty has given birth
to a very healthy baby girl
And did you not find such
occurrences shocking, eminency?
Your majesty, I am a venetian.
I come from a city where all the men
are gamblers and all the women whores.
What is there to be
shocked about, huh?
Majesty.
Majesty.
I'm so sorry.
You and I are both young,
and by god's grace,
boys will follow.
- Lady Eleanor.
- Your majesty.
- Do you play chess?
- Yes, your majesty.
Come, let's play.
That's my first move.

<i>Précédemment...</i>
L'annulation de mon mariage
doit ętre prononcée.
Le Roi vous demande
d'agréer la nomination
- d'un nouvel Archevęque de Canterbury
- Quel est le nom du candidat ?
<i>Thomas Cranmer, un inconnu.</i>
Quel mal peut infliger un inconnu
ŕ notre Sainte Église ?
<i>Que l'union entre
le Roi Henry d'Angleterre</i>
et Catherine d'Aragon
est déclarée nulle et non avenue.
Cette suprématie
contre notre Sainte Église,
représentera une terrible déchirure,
du manteau immaculé du Christ.
<i>On dit que le Roi a épousé Anne.
Et qu'elle serait déjŕ enceinte.</i>
Je veux que le peuple aime sa Reine.
<i>Et si je peux l'aimer,
pourquoi pas eux.</i>
<i>Si vous réussissiez ŕ tuer cette catin,
vous serez aimé de Dieu,</i>
<i>et de tout les Anglais de bonne foi.</i>
- Malheureusement, j'ai échoué.
- Qui sait mon fils.
Les voies du Seigneur
sont impénétrables.
Je viens présenter ma démission
de mon poste de Chancelier.
Je ne peux pas maintenant.
<i>Pour l'enfant.</i>
<i>Exquise, n'est-ce pas.</i>
Lady Eleanor Luke.
Dois-je lui parler en ton nom ?
<i>Je crains pour la Reine et sa fille.
Anne Boleyn les déteste.</i>
Votre mčre doit accepter
le titre de Princesse douairičre.
Vous-męme, n'avez plus droit
au titre de princesse.
<i>Il vous est interdit, dčs lors,
de communiquer avec votre mčre.</i>
<i>Le Pape menace de m'excommunier,
si je ne revenais pas ŕ Catherine.</i>
C'est trop tard.
je veux que vous organisiez
joutes, banquets et bal masqué
<i>pour la naissance de mon fils.</i>
Votre Majesté a donné naissance
ŕ une trčs jolie petite fille.
Je suis désolée.

Renonces-tu ŕ Satan ?
J'y renonce.
Je te baptise
au nom du Pčre,
du fils,
et du Saint-Esprit.
Va en paix
et que Dieu te protčge.
Amen.
Dieu le bienfaiteur,
accorde une vie longue et prospčre,
ŕ Son Altesse toute puissante,
Princesse d'Angleterre,
Elizabeth !
<i>Il ne peut y avoir de doute
quant ŕ la succession.</i>
Vous établirez un édit
ŕ présenter au Parlement.
Il précisera que la succession
est un droit acquis ŕ nos enfants...
et nuls autres.
Je ferai selon vos ordres.
M. Cromwell, je suis conscient
que certaines personnes,
ŕ l'esprit obtu ou dont
la position est confuse,
ne reconnaissent toujours pas
mon mariage avec la Reine.
Pour cette raison, je pense...
que certaines sanctions
devront ętre prises ŕ leur encontre.
Tous auront l'opportunité
de démontrer leur loyauté.
<i>Château de Ludlow
Pays de Galles</i>
On m'a rapporté que
cette dame est trčs gęnée
d'avoir donné naissance ŕ une fille,
et non au fils qu'elle avait promis.
Ŕ mon avis, il est clair ŕ présent,
que Dieu l'a abandonnée.
Comment va ma mčre... la Reine ?
Hélas, je ne peux lui rendre visite.
J'ai des nouvelles
par ses dames de compagnie.
Elles m'ont dit qu'elle demeure forte.
Mais, elle supplie encore
le Roi, votre pčre,
d'avoir la bonté
de l'autoriser ŕ vous voir.
Je suis sűre qu'un jour,
Sa Majesté se ravisera.
Car je pense...
je suis sűre qu'il m'aime toujours
et se préoccupe de mon état.
J'en suis persuadé.
Évęque Tunstall.
Sir Thomas.
Merci.
Que me vaut cet honneur ?
Nous nous connaissons
depuis fort longtemps, Sir Thomas.
Maintenant que vous vous ętes
retiré de la vie publique
je ne vous vois plus.
Naturellement, je voulais
savoir comment vous alliez.
Je vais trčs bien, merci.
Mais je suis...
exorcisé par le fait que
l'une de nos vieilles connaissances
soit toujours incarcéré.
Vous parlez de l'Évęque Fisher.
L'acte qu'il a commis est regrettable.
De quel acte parlez-vous ?
De son intransigeance.
Je vois...
Dites-moi,
est-ce le Roi qui vous a envoyé ?
Sa Majesté se demande
pourquoi n'avez-vous pas assisté
au couronnement de la Reine,
malgré que vous y avez été invité ?
En réponse ŕ cela, laissez-moi...
laissez-moi vous expliquer
ma vision des choses.
Il y a une histoire
sur l'Empereur Tibčre.
Il avait établi une loi
infligeant la peine de mort
pour certains crimes
ŕ moins que le coupable soit vierge.
Le jour oů ce cas s'est présenté,
l'Empereur ne savait plus comment agir.
Alors, un de ses conseillers
lui suggéra une solution.
Qu'elle soit d'abord dépucelée,
pour qu'elle puisse ensuite...
... ętre dévorée.
Certaines personnes...
... dont je tairai le nom,
s'octroient un couronnement,
pręchent ensuite en sa faveur,
puis rédigent des textes
pour le justifier.
Ils commencent par vous déflorer,
et ne tarderont pas ŕ...
... vous dévorer.
Mais ils ne me dépucelleront jamais !
C'était merveilleux.
Vous en jouez ?
Tout le temps.
- Majesté.
- Lady Eleanor...
Ce n'est pas grave.
Plutôt ainsi, regarde.
Les doigts dans cette position.
Sans tordre la flčche.
Vise...
et relâche.
Je n'y arriverai jamais.
Bien sűr que si.
Je le tiens, Votre Grâce.
- M. le Secrétaire.
- Votre Grâce.
- Votre fils ?
- Oui.
Je lui apprends le tir
avant d'ętre trop âgé pour.
- Vous tirez ŕ l'arc, Cromwell ?
- Parfois, Votre Grâce.
Milord.
Allons marcher.
Que veut le Roi ?
Sa Majesté veut vous voir,
ainsi que votre femme, ŕ la cour.
- Votre compagnie lui manque.
- Et ?
Sa Majesté est consciente
que vous préférez la cause impériale.
Vous l'avez dit ouvertement
lors du conseil.
Et que vous avez une grande sympathie
pour la Princesse douairičre.
Pas vous ?
En fait, si.
Je ne suis pas insensible,
comme le pensent certains.
Bien au contraire.
Mais je suis au service du Roi.
Sa Majesté a l'intention
de limiter la succession
aux enfants qu'il aura
de la Reine Anne.
Un édit qu'il exposera au Parlement.
Il veut savoir s'il aura votre vote.
Elle a faim.
Que faites-vous ?
Majesté.
Ne peut-elle pas se nourrir
de mon propre sein ?
Les Reines ne font pas cela.
Surtout pour une fille.
Rendez-la ŕ sa nourrice.
La Princesse aura bientôt
sa propre demeure ŕ Hatfield.
Lady Mary et d'autres encore,
prendront soin d'elle.
La fille de Catherine ?
Oui.
Il est bon qu'elle s'accommode
ŕ son nouveau statut.
M. Cromwell s'en est déjŕ occupé.
Je vous donnerai un fils.
Mon amour, rejoignez vite...
mon accueillante couche.
Mesdames.
Majesté.
<i>Alice, les enfants...</i>
j'ai quelque chose ŕ vous dire.
Mes revenus sont
actuellement si réduits que...
que nous ne pourrons
continuer ŕ vivre de la sorte.
Je ne jouis plus de la bonté du Roi.
Et de ce fait,
je dois vivre modestement.
Et... réduire les dépenses
de ma demeure.
Ceux d'entre vous qui le peuvent
devront avoir leurs propres demeures et
assurer leur subsistance.
- Mais pčre...
- Non, je vous prie.
Les choses devront changer.
Je ne peux pas
vous assumer éternellement.
La vie n'est pas de la sorte.
La vraie vie est cruelle,
et difficile.
Vous devrez y faire face.
Et peut-ętre ŕ pire.
Allez, mangez...
Puis-je avoir un peu de vin ?
Oui, Mčre.
<i>Maison Hatfield
Hertfordshire</i>
Lady Mary, Lady Bryan.
Lady Mary.
Bienvenue ŕ Hatfield.
Votre nouvelle demeure.
Je suis Lady Margaret Brian,
la gouvernante de la Princesse.
Voici les autres dames qui devront
également s'occuper de la Princesse.
Lady Mary, puis-je vous présenter
ŕ Son Altesse, la Princesse Elizabeth.
Vous serez conduite ŕ votre chambre.
Vos obligations débuteront le matin,
aprčs les pričres.
Je souhaite prier seule.
Voici votre chambre, Milady.
Joyeux Noël.
Pourquoi, quand on devient vieux, a-t-on
toujours l'impression que c'est Noël ?
Bien sűr, c'est toujours Noël
pour vous Milord, n'est-ce pas ?
Baron de naissance,
et d'autres nouveaux titres.
Rappelez-les-moi.
Maître de Buckhounds.
Lord Warden des Cinq Ports.
N'y en a-t-il pas un autre ?
Maître de l'hôpital Bedlam
pour les aliénés ?
Oui.
Envisagez-vous de le visiter ?
Pas en tant que pensionnaire.
J'ai lu une de vos satires
sur la vie ŕ la cour.
Si j'étais vous,
je serais plus prudent en critiquant
ceux qui ont le pouvoir de vous nuire.
Ceci est un conseil d'ami.
Maintenant, mon amour,
j'ai un présent pour vous.
C'est magnifique !
Qui l'a fait ?
Maître Holbein.
Cet homme est un génie.
Et vous de męme,
ma merveilleuse Reine.
Joyeux Noël.
Je peux encore le faire.
- Je peux l'empoisonner.
- Non.
- Mais je croyais que...
- Mon maître serait soupçonné.
Il n'en a nul besoin, maintenant.
Il doit faire la guerre aux Turcs.
- Personne ne le saura.
- Ne soyez pas stupide, Brereton.
Ils vous trouveront et vous tortureront.
- Et vous leur direz tout.
- Je ne le ferais pas.
Je mourrais en martyr.
Vous n'avez jamais vu
un homme se faire torturer.
Vous comprenez ?
N'agissez pas seul.
Charles !
- Joyeux Noël.
- Et ŕ Votre Majesté aussi.
- J'ai un présent pour vous.
- Oů est-il ?
Vous devrez attendre
la session du parlement.
Il s'agit de mon vote.
Comment ai-je pu douter de toi ?
Eleanor Luke.
Voyez comment le Roi la regarde.
C'est sa maîtresse.
Débarrassez-vous d'elle.
- Mary.
- Majesté.
Nous devons vous trouver
un nouvel époux.
J'ai un autre cadeau pour vous.
J'attends un autre enfant.
Majesté, conseillers...
voici le nouvel édit,
l'édit de succession,
que je dois présenter
ŕ la Chambre des Députés.
Il désigne les enfants nés
de Sa Majesté et de la Reine Anne,
comme premiers héritiers légitimes.
Il protégera cette nation
des scissions dont
elle a souffert par le passé,
quand différentes lignées
prétendaient au trône.
Cet édit prévient les personnes
dont les dires ou les écrits
visent ŕ porter préjudice
ou ŕ calomnier le mariage légal
entre le Roi et sa tendre
et bien-aimée épouse, la Reine Anne,
ou contre ses héritiers,
qu'ils seront coupables
de haute trahison,
dont la peine encourue est la mort,
et la confiscation des biens
par la couronne.
"Ce nouvel édit requiert
de tout les sujets du Roi,
qu'ils prętent serment,
d'ętre sincčrement, fermement,
perpétuellement, sans fraude ni ruse,
attentifs, obéissants, coopératifs,
soutenant et préservant
le contenu et l'accomplissement
de cet édit."
Ce serment requiert également
la reconnaissance
de l'autorité du Roi,
dans tous les aspects
spirituels et temporels.
Ceux qui refuseront de l'accomplir
seront reconnus coupable de trahison
et incarcérés.
C'est parfait, M. le Secrétaire.
Je suis ravi.
Au final, il faudra pręter serment.
Que Dieu nous protčge.
<i>Et unam sanctam</i>
<i>catholicam</i>
<i>et apostolicam ecclesian.</i>
<i>In nomine Patris et Fillii</i>
<i>et Spiritu Sancti.</i>
<i>Amen.</i>
Le Roi persiste-t-il
dans son entętement ?
Oui, Saint-Pčre.
Il refuse d'écouter nos avertissements,
et il oblige les bons croyants
ŕ parjurer leurs âmes immortelles.
Comment cela ?
Ils devront tous pręter serment
que le Roi est le chef
de l'Église d'Angleterre.
Ceux qui refusent,
seront jetés en prison.
Comme notre frčre, l'Évęque Fisher.
Oui, Saint-Pčre.
Cela est inacceptable.
Le berger ne peut pas rester passif
pendant que le loup investi l'enclos
et menace son troupeau.
J'ai décidé de nommer Fisher Cardinal.
Vous enverrez sa coiffe en Angleterre.
Voyons si le Roi est capable
de persécuter et torturer
un Prince de l'Église.
Maîtresse Bryan.
- Bonjour.
- Votre Majesté.
Je suis pressé.
Comment va ma fille ?
Elle ressemble ŕ votre Majesté
en tout point.
Mon Elizabeth.
Qui sait, Maîtresse Bryan,
un jour peut-ętre, cette petite fille
dominera des empires.
Je t'en prie, pardonne-moi.
Je n'ai pas beaucoup de temps.
Merci...
pour toute votre attention
ŕ l'égard de la Princesse.
Votre Majesté.
Lady Eleanor.
Milord.
Pensiez-vous que nous
n'allions pas découvrir votre secret ?
- Je...
- Nous avons fouillé votre chambre.
Milord ?
Nous avons trouvé les bijoux.
Vous les aviez mal cachés.
- Des bijoux ? Je ne...
- Les bijoux de Sa Majesté.
Ceux que vous avez volés.
- C'est faux !
- Et je dis que si.
Si jamais vos crimes
venaient ŕ ętre connus,
qui vous croira ?
Aprčs tout...
Lady Eleanor,
nul ne peut prétendre
que vous soyez innocente.
N'est-ce pas ?
Que dois-je faire ?
Quittez la cour.
Retournez ŕ votre famille.
Voyez s'ils vous reprendront.
Cousine Madge !
Lady Sheldon, que lisiez-vous ?
Rien, Milady.
Juste des počmes...
écrits par Sir Thomas Wyatt.
Donnez-les-moi.
Vous ne devriez pas perdre
votre temps dans pareilles futilités.
Si vous voulez lire, alors que
vous ętes censées me servir,
vous devriez lire ce livre !
Vous apprendriez beaucoup plus,
peut-ętre y gagnerez-vous en sagesse.
Oui, Madame.
Retournez ŕ votre travail.
Le Comte de Wiltshire, Votre Majesté.
Papa.
Votre Majesté.
Vous semblez resplendissante.
Et je vois que
cela commence ŕ se voir.
En partie.
Comment était votre voyage ŕ Paris ?
C'était...
Le Roi François n'est pas homme facile.
Il vous envoie ses présents de mariage,
mais ne vous reconnaît pas comme Reine,
tant que Catherine demeure en vie.
Comment va le Roi ?
Il doit se réjouir de votre état.
Il l'est.
Mais encore...
Tout va bien.
Mais pendant ma grossesse,
le Roi a pris une maîtresse.
Et ŕ présent...
je redoute qu'il en prenne une autre.
Je dois ętre prudente
pour le bien de l'enfant
et ne pas le laisser jouir
de ses droits conjugaux.
Il est naturel qu'un homme,
quand sa femme est gestante
et qu'elle ne veut plus de lui,
de trouver un certain
réconfort... ailleurs.
Et pour les Rois,
c'est une tradition.
Chérie,
écoutez-moi.
Le danger n'est pas que le Roi
prenne une maîtresse...
mais qu'il prenne la mauvaise.
Quelqu'un qu'on ne puisse pas contrôler,
ou qui chercherait ŕ contrôler le Roi.
Mais...
si vous pensez que le Roi
va prendre une maîtresse,
alors, assurez-vous
qu'elle sera de votre choix...
et non pas... le sien.
Je dois faire mon rapport au Roi.
Je vous verrai plus tard.
- M. le Secrétaire.
- Réverend Fisher.
Je viens m'assurer
que vous ętes bien traité.
Ŕ ce sujet, mon... vieil estomac
ne supporte pas les immondes repas
que le geôlier me sert.
Mais ce n'est rien, du moment que cela
affecte mon corps et non pas mon âme.
Vous n'avez pas pręté serment.
Non.
Pourquoi donc ?
Refusez-vous d'admettre
que le mariage du Roi
est décent et légal ?
Je suis persuadé que
Sa Majesté croit qu'il l'est.
Pas vous ?
Non.
Mes convictions n'ont pas changé.
Le mariage du Roi et de
la Reine Catherine est encore valide,
et ne peut-ętre annulé
par aucun homme, pas męme...
l'Archevęque Cranmer.
Et...
... niez-vous...
que le Roi est le chef supręme
de l'Église d'Angleterre ?
Oui, je le nie, catégoriquement.
Le Roi, notre souverain,
n'est pas le chef supręme sur terre
de l'Église d'Angleterre.
Dites-moi,
comment va Sir Thomas More ?
Geôlier !
Je tenterai...
d'améliorer la qualité de vos repas.
Merci.
Pourquoi avez-vous
renvoyé Lady Eleanor ?
Elle m'a volée un objet précieux.
- Ętes-vous sűre qu'elle l'avait volé ?
- Oui.
J'avais des preuves.
Je n'ai pas eu le choix.
J'espčre que Votre Majesté
n'est pas trop dépitée ?
De toute façon,
j'ai quelque chose pour vous.
Votre Majesté.
Elizabeth.
Merci.
Qu'est-ce cela ?
Majesté, dans un certain nombre
de petits monastčres
que j'ai eu l'occasion de visiter,
les moines refusent de pręter serment.
Ils préfčrent servir le Vicaire de Rome.
Voici l'édit de leur dissolution.
Les importants avoirs de ces maisons
seront transférés
dans le trésor de Sa Majesté.
Quoi d'autre ?
Majesté, je viens d'apprendre
que le Pape
entend faire du Révérend Fisher,
un Cardinal.
Apparemment,
il lui a déjŕ envoyé sa coiffe.
Fisher devra alors
la porter sur ses épaules.
Le temps qu'elle arrive ici,
il n'aura plus de tęte pour la porter.
Et qu'en est-il de More ?
Je veux savoir !
Prętera-t-il serment ?
Comment va-t-elle ?
Parfaitement bien, Votre Majesté.
Elle ne pleure presque pas,
comme si elle savait déjŕ
qu'elle est une princesse.
Je vous aime, Elizabeth.
Je vous aime de tout mon cśur.
et j'espčre que
vous ne l'oublierez jamais.
Votre Majesté.
Avant de partir, je voudrais
m'entretenir avec Lady Mary.
Lady Mary...
Lady Mary, je suis venue en paix.
Vous pourriez revenir ŕ la cour,
et vous réconcilier avec votre pčre,
si vous m'acceptiez
en tant que Reine.
Je ne reconnais de Reine que ma mčre.
Mais si la maîtresse du Roi...
pouvait intercéder en ma faveur
auprčs du Roi...
je lui en serais reconnaissante.
Sir Thomas More.
Sir Thomas.
M. le Secrétaire.
Je vous en prie, asseyez-vous.
Ceci est une rencontre informelle.
Un peu de bičre, peut-ętre ?
Non, merci.
Vous connaissez la raison
qui nous amčne ŕ nous rencontrer.
Il est murmuré en tous lieux,
Sir Thomas,
que vous avez refusé de reconnaître
l'édit de la succession.
Je vous le dis ouvertement
et avec sincérité,
je ne voudrais aucun mal
ŕ un grand homme
qui a bénéficié, des années durant,
des bonnes grâces de Sa Majesté.
Je préférerais perdre mon propre fils
que de vous voir souffrir.
Puis-je connaître votre avis
sur le nouveau mariage du Roi ?
Je n'en ai aucun.
Je n'ai ni murmuré,
ni débattu ŕ ce sujet.
Je ne l'ai jamais fait...
et ne le ferai jamais.
Et au sujet du désir
d'autorité de Sa Majesté
sur l'Église d'Angleterre ?
Cette question me rendait perplexe
jusqu'ŕ ce que je relise
le pamphlet de Sa Majesté :
<i>L'Assertio septum Sacramentorum</i>
En fait, je...
j'en ai une copie ici.
Dans ce pamphlet,
le Roi assure
l'origine divine de la Papauté.
L'autorité du Pape provient directement
du Rocher de St-Pierre.
Vous trouverez
les arguments de Sa Majesté...
aussi persuasifs qu'ils l'étaient
quand il les a écrits.
Pręterez-vous serment ?
Je dois vous rappeler
les conséquences d'une abstention.
M. le Secrétaire,
je suis un loyal sujet du Roi.
Je ne dis pas de mal,
ne pense pas ŕ mal,
mais je veux le bien de tous.
Et si cela est insuffisant
pour qu'un homme reste en vie,
je ne mérite donc pas de vivre.
Sir Thomas...
vous devez savoir que le Roi
ne veut pas vous y contraindre.
Il demande simplement que vous cédiez
et que vous daigniez approuver
sa requęte en prętant serment.
M. Cromwell, je vous prie de transmettre
au Roi ma profonde fidélité,
honnęteté et loyauté ŕ son égard.
Cousine Madge.
Oui, Madame ?
Venez me parler.
Je suppose que vous avez
de nombreux admirateurs ?
Oui,
mais j'ai en mémoire ce que
Votre Majesté nous avait dit :
"Ne pas ętre lubrique...
et montrer l'exemple."
J'en suis persuadée.
Mais cela vous surprend-il
de savoir qu'un de vos admirateurs
... est le Roi ?
- C'est impossible !
- C'est vrai.
Mais vous serez encore plus surprise
de savoir que vous aurez ma bénédiction
pour devenir sa maîtresse.
- Madame !
- Quand j'étais enceinte,
Sa Majesté avait besoin
d'une femme dans sa couche.
C'est un passionné.
Mais je dois pouvoir
lui faire confiance.
Et faire confiance ŕ sa famille,
comme vous.
Aprčs tout, nous sommes
de la męme famille.
Et vous ętes des réformateurs.
Oui, Votre Majesté, nous avons
pręté serment de bon cśur.
Alors, accepteriez-vous de bon cśur
le Roi dans votre couche ?
Son Excellence, l'Ambassadeur Impérial.
- Excellence.
- Votre Majesté.
Pardonnez-moi, mais je viens
demander votre clémence.
- Ma clémence ?
- Effectivement,
votre fille, Lady Mary, est malade,
et ses médecins s'en inquičtent.
J'ai une lettre... écrite par sa mčre.
Elle voudrait s'occuper de sa fille.
Elle a écrit... puis-je ?
<i>Un peu de réconfort et de joie</i>
<i>améliorera sensiblement son état.</i>
<i>Je pourrais prendre soin d'elle</i>
<i>la faire dormir dans mon lit</i>
<i>et ętre ŕ ses côtés
quand elle en a besoin.</i>
J'enverrai mon médecin personnel
pour l'examiner et la soigner.
Mais je ne peux pas permettre
que Mary et sa mčre soient réunies.
Mais Votre Majesté,
ce ne sont que les pleurs
- d'une mčre pour sa fille.
- Ce n'est pas seulement cela !
Elles ne sont pas
n'importe quelle mčre ou fille.
Ne pensez-vous pas
qu'elles iraient conspirer contre moi ?
- Je ne crois pas.
- Vous le savez parfaitement !
Cela s'est déjŕ produit.
Et parfois, la maladie est utilisée
dans un but politique.
Ne pensez-vous pas que Catherine
veut que Mary devienne Reine ?
M. Chapuys,
Lady Catherine est une femme
extręmement fičre et obstinée,
dotée d'un courage immense.
Elle peut monter une armée,
et engager une guerre contre moi
aussi féroce que celles engagées
par sa mčre Isabelle en Espagne.
Est-ce faux ?
<i>Une citation m'a été remise</i>
pour comparaître au Palais de Lambeth
afin de pręter serment.
Je crois que je serai emprisonné
aprčs cela.
- Non !
- Pčre !
Soyez bons entre vous
et pour les autres.
Si vous ne pouvez pas l'ętre,
soyez les moins mauvais possible.
Non, chérie.
Lady Sheldon.
- Oů est la Reine ?
- Votre Majesté,
la Reine se sent mal
et vous demande
de l'excuser pour son absence.
Bien sűr.
Elle...
Elle demande
si Sa Majesté serait satisfaite si...
je prenais sa place.
En vous tenant compagnie.
Si la Reine vous y a autorisé,
alors, pourquoi pas ?
Lady Sheldon.
<i>Palais de Lambeth
Londres</i>
Quel est votre prénom, Lady Sheldon ?
Margaret, Votre Majesté.
Mais, on m'appelle Madge.
Je vous appellerai donc Madge,
si vous me le permettez ?
Bien sűr, Votre Majesté.
Sir Thomas.
Ętes-vous disposé ŕ pręter serment ?
Puis-je le voir ?
Merci.
Alors ?
Je ne veux blâmer ni ce serment,
ni ceux qui l'ont écrit,
ni quiconque l'a reconnu.
Et je ne condamnerai jamais
la conscience des autres.
Mais personnellement
et en toute bonne foi,
ma conscience
me dicte de reconnaître
la validité de la succession,
mais non le reste...
sans risquer que mon âme
soit damnée pour l'éternité.
Nous sommes profondément désolés
d'apprendre cela.
Vous ętes presque le seul
et votre refus provoquera
chez Son Altesse le Roi
indignation et doutes ŕ votre encontre.
Voici tous les membres
de la Chambre des Lords
qui ont juré de pręter serment.
- De męme que le Clergé.
- Je ne peux pas le faire.
Mais je ne blâme nul autre l'ayant fait.
Sir Thomas, nous sommes
parvenus ŕ la conclusion
que loin d'ętre dévoué et loyal
serviteur de Sa Majesté,
il n'y a jamais eu
de serviteur aussi vil
et traître ŕ son Prince que vous.
Si vous refusez de pręter serment,
vous ne serez pas
seulement en prison, mais
vous aurez ŕ subir
les pires choses imaginables.
Milords, ces menaces sont
pour les enfants, non pour moi.
Niez-vous...
avoir harcelé... et convaincu le Roi,
ŕ l'encontre de sa conscience,
de rédiger ce pamphlet contre Luther ?
Bien sűr que je le nie.
Premičrement, je n'ai jamais demandé
ŕ personne, quelle que soit sa position,
d'agir ŕ l'encontre de sa conscience.
Et en second...
c'est Sa Majesté
qui m'a plutôt persuadée
de l'importance primordiale
de la Papauté.
Je vous le demande une derničre fois,
avant que les pires sanctions
ne vous soient appliquées.
Pourquoi ne voulez-vous pas jurer ?
Pourquoi ne le voulez-vous pas ?
Oh, Madge !
- Quoi ?
- Madge !
Je ne sais pas. C'est amusant.
Madge.
J'aime vos fossettes
quand vous riez, Madge.
Madge.
Votre Majesté.
Approchez-vous.
Laissez-moi...
examiner vos fossettes,
d'un peu plus prčs.
Sir Thomas.
Merci.
Votre Altesse appréciera de savoir
que le Réverend Fisher
est logé dans la pičce du bas.
Bonne journée, Sir.

<i>Previously...</i>
The annulment of my marriage
must be declared immediately.
The King of England asks your approval
to appoint an Archbishop of Canterbury.
- What is the name of the candidate?
- Thomas Cranmer, a nobody.
What harm can a nobody inflict
on our Holy Church?
That the union between
King Henry of England
and Katherine of Aragon
is declared null and void.
Regal supremacy over our Holy Church
would represent a tearing asunder
of the seamless coat of Christ.
There are rumours that
the King has married Anne
<i>and that she's already with child.</i>
<i>I want the people to love
their new Queen. And if I can love her,</i>
<i>why shouldn't they?</i>
<i>If you succeed
in killing the King's whore,</i>
<i>you will be the beloved of God,
and of the faithful people of England.</i>
- Unfortunately, Holy Father, I failed.
- Who knows, my son?
God works in mysterious ways.
I come to offer my resignation
from my post as Chancellor.
I can't. Not now, while the baby...
<i>Exquisite, isn't she?</i>
Lady Eleanor Luke.
Shall I talk to her on your behalf?
<i>I fear for the Queen. Anne Boleyn
hates her. And her daughter, too.</i>
Your mother must now accept
the title of Dowager Princess,
just as you have no right
to call yourself Princess.
<i>You are forbidden to communicate
with your mother from this day forward.</i>
The Pope threatens to excommunicate me
if I do not return to Katherine.
He's too late.
I want you to organise jousts,
banquets and masques
<i>to celebrate the birth of my son.</i>
Your Majesty has given birth
to a very healthy baby girl.
I'm so sorry.

Abrenuntias satanae
(Do you renounce Satan)
Abrenuntio.
(I do renounce him.)
Ego te baptizo,
(I baptize you)
in nomine Patris
(in the name of the Father, )
et Filii,
(and of the Son)
et Spiritus Sancti.
(and of the Holy Spirit)
Vade in pace,
(Go in peace)
et Dominus vobiscum.
(and the Lord be with you.)
Amen.
God, of infinite goodness,
send prosperous life and long
to the high and mighty
Princess of England,
Elizabeth!
<i>There can be no question
of illegitimacy.</i>
You will prepare a bill
to put before Parliament.
It will state that the succession
is now firmly vested in our children...
and no others.
I shall do as Your Majesty commands.
I am mindful, Mr. Cromwell,
that there are some people
some wrong-headed, some biased people
who are still unwilling
to accept the validity of my marriage.
In view of that, I think...
some sanction
should be made against them.
Everyone will be given their opportunity
to demonstrate their loyalty.
I am told that the Lady
is much dismayed
at having given birth to a daughter
and not the son she promised.
To my mind, it is sure proof
that God has abandoned her.
How is my mother, the Queen?
Alas, I cannot visit or speak to her.
I have little communications
with her ladies,
and they tell me she is still strong...
but always begs the King, your father,
of his mercy, to be allowed to see you.
I am sure His Majesty
will one day relent,
for I think...
I believe with all my heart
that he still loves and cares for me.
I am sure that he does.
Bishop Tunstall.
Sir Thomas.
Thank you.
To what do I owe this honour?
We have known each other
a long time, Sir Thomas.
But now you have retired
from public life
and I never see you.
Naturally I was concerned
about your welfare.
I am very well, thank you.
But I am...
I am exorcised by the fact
that one of our old acquaintances
is still under house arrest.
You mean Bishop Fisher?
Yes, the outcome is regrettable.
The "outcome" of what?
His intransigence.
I see.
Tell me,
has the King sent you here to see me?
His Majesty wondered
why you did not attend
the Queen's Coronation,
as you were invited to do.
Well...
in answer to that, let me...
let me show my poor mind to you.
There's a story
about the Emperor Tiberius.
He had enacted a law which exacted death
for a certain crime... unless
the offender was a virgin.
Now, when a virgin eventually
appeared on the charge,
the Emperor didn't know exactly
how to proceed,
so one of his council
proposed the perfect solution:
Let her first be deflowered,
so she then can be
... devoured.
There are some...
and no, I won't name them...
who first procure you
for the coronation,
next to preach at it,
and then to write books defending it.
Thus they deflower you,
and will not fail soon afterwards to
... devour you.
But they shall never deflower me.
That was beautiful.
Do you play?
All the time.
- Majesty.
- Lady Eleanor.
Never mind.
More like this. Watch.
Fingers like so.
Don't squeeze the arrow.
Draw...
and release.
I'll never do that.
Yes, you will.
Your Grace. I have it.
- Mr. Secretary.
- Your Grace.
- And your son?
- Yes.
I'm teaching him to sport
before I get too old for it.
- Do you shoot, Cromwell?
- Sometimes, Your Grace.
My Lord.
Shall we walk?
What does the King want?
His Majesty would like
to see you back at court.
With your wife.
He misses Your Grace's company.
And?
His Majesty is aware
that you favour the Imperialist cause
you say so openly in Council
and have, perhaps, a great sympathy
for the Dowager Princess?
 Don't you?
Actually, I do.
I'm not heartless,
whatever some people think.
Quite the contrary.
But I serve the King.
His Majesty intends
to vest the succession
with the children he will have
with Queen Anne.
A bill will go before Parliament.
He wants to know
if he'll have your support.
Hungry?
What are you doing?
Your Majesty.
May I not feed her from my own breast?
Queens don't do that...
especially not for a daughter.
Give her back to her wet-nurse.
The Princess will shortly be given
her own establishment at Hatfield.
Among others, the Lady Mary
will attend and wait on her.
Katherine's daughter?
Yes.
It is well that she knows her new place.
Secretary Cromwell is arranging it.
I will still give you a son.
Come soon, my darling,
to my hot bed.
- Ladies.
- Majesty.
<i>Alice, children...</i>
My dear family,
I have something to say to you.
My income is now
so greatly reduced, that...
that we can no longer go on living
as we are accustomed.
I am no longer the recipient
of the King's bounty.
And so,
I must live frugally
and... reduce my household.
Those of you who can must
live in your own houses
and eat at your own tables.
- But, Father...
- No. Come on.
Things inevitably must change.
You can't all be supported forever.
Life is not like that.
Real life is raw
and difficult.
And you must face up to that fact.
If not to even worse things.
Come on. Let us eat.
Give me a little wine, please.
Yes, mother.
The Lady Mary, Lady Bryan.
Lady Mary.
Welcome to Hatfield, your new home.
I am Lady Margaret Bryan,
the Princess's Governess.
These other Ladies, are also here
to attend the Princess.
Lady Mary, may I present you
to her Highness the Princess Elizabeth.
You will be shown to your room.
You will begin your duties
in the mornings, after prayers.
I shall say my prayers alone.
sThis is your room, my Lady.
Christmas.
Why is it that as you get older,
it always seems to be Christmas?
Of course, it is always
Christmas for you, isn't it, my Lord?
A Baron in your own right now,
and some new titles.
Remind me.
Master of Buckhounds.
Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.
Was there not another one?
Master of the Bedlam Hospital
for the insane?
Yes.
Do you plan to visit it?
I don't mean as an inmate.
I read one of your satires
about life here at court.
If I were you,
I'd be more careful about poking fun
at those who have the power to hurt you.
That's just friendly advice.
Here, my love.
I have a gift for you.
It's fantastic!
Who made this?
Master Holbein.
The man's a genius.
As are you,
my beautiful Queen.
Happy Christmas.
I could still do it.
- I could find a way to poison her.
- No!
- But I thought that was...
- It would be blamed on my master.
At the moment, he doesn't need that.
He has a war with the Turks
to contend with.
- But why should anyone ever know?
- Don't be stupid, Brereton.
They would find you and torture you,
- and you would tell them everything.
- No, I wouldn't.
I'd die a martyr's death.
You've never seen a man being tortured.
Now do you understand?
You don't act alone.
Charles.
- Happy Christmas.
- And to Your Majesty.
- I have a gift for you.
- Where is it?
You'll have to wait
the new session of Parliament.
For it's my vote.
How could I have ever doubted you?
Eleanor Luke.
You see the way the King looks at her?
She's his mistress.
Get rid of her.
Mary. Majesty.
We must find you a new husband.
I have another gift for you.
I am with child again.
<i>Majesty, Councillors...</i>
here is the new Act,
the Act of Succession,
which I am commanded to present shortly
to the Houses of Parliament.
The Act nominates the children born
of His Majesty and Queen Anne
as first rightful heirs.
By so doing, it protects
the nation from the divisions
it has suffered in the past,
when several different titles
have pretended to the throne.
The Act warns
that anyone saying or writing
anything to the prejudice or slander
of the lawful matrimony between the King
and his most dear
and entirely beloved wife Queen Anne,
or against his heirs,
would be guilty of high treason,
for which the penalty is death,
and forfeiture of goods to the Crown.
<i>"The new Act requires
all the King's subjects,</i>
"if so commanded, to swear an oath
"that they shall truly, firmly,
constantly, without fraud and guile,
"observe, fulfil, maintain,
defend and keep
"the whole contents
and effect of the Bill."
This oath will also require recognition
of the King's supremacy in all matters,
spiritual and temporal.
Those who refuse to take it...
will be accounted guilty of treason
and sent to prison.
That is all well done, Mr. Secretary.
I am pleased.
So it must be sworn by oath, after all.
God save us.
Et unam sanctam
catholicam
et apostolicam ecclesian.
In nomine Patris et Fillii
et Spiritu Sancti.
Amen.
Does the King remain obdurate?
Yes, Holy Father.
He refuses to listen to advice,
and he forces all true believers
to perjure their immortal souls.
How so?
They must all swear an oath
that the King is head
of the English church.
Those who refuse are put in prison.
Like our brother in Christ,
Bishop Fisher.
Yes, Holy Father.
This is unacceptable.
The shepherd cannot stand idly by
while the wolf enters the fold
and threatens his flock.
I have decided
to make Fisher a Cardinal.
You will send his hat to England.
Let's see if the King is still prepared
to prosecute and torture
a Prince of the Church.
Mistress Bryan.
A very good morning to you.
I'm on Progress.
I've come to see my daughter.
How is she?
She is a credit to Your Majesty
in every way.
My Elizabeth.
Who knows, Mistress Bryan,
perhaps one day this little girl
will preside over empires.
Please forgive me...
I don't have much time.
Thank you
for all your care toward
our beloved Princess.
Your Majesty.
Lady Eleanor.
My Lord.
How did you suppose
no one would find out your secret?
- I...
- Your chamber was searched today.
- My Lord...?
- The jewels were found.
You did not hide them well enough.
- Jewels...? I don't...
- Her Majesty's jewels.
The ones you stole.
- It's not true!
- And I say it is true.
And if your crimes were ever reported,
who do you suppose would believe you?
After all,
Lady Eleanor,
no one could accuse you
of being innocent...
could they?
What am I to do?
Leave court.
Go back to your family.
See if they will have you.
Cousin Madge!
Lady Sheldon, what are you reading?
Nothing, my Lady.
Just some... poetry.
By Sir Thomas Wyatt.
Give it here.
You should not be wasting
your time on such trifles.
If you must read, when you are supposed
to be attending on me,
then you should read that book!
You will learn
a great deal more from it,
perhaps even some wisdom.
Yes, Madam.
Now go about your business.
The Earl of Wiltshire, Your Majesty.
Papa.
Your Majesty.
You look well.
And I believe you're already showing.
A little.
How was your trip to Paris?
It was...
King Francis is not
the easiest man to deal with.
He sends you wedding presents,
but he can't officially
recognize you as Queen.
As long as Katherine remains alive.
How is the King?
He must be pleased at your condition.
He is.
But...?
Everything is fine.
But when I was last with child,
the King took a mistress.
And now...
now I fear he will take another,
since I must be careful
for the sake of the child
and not let him enjoy
his conjugal rights.
It is natural for a man,
when his wife is big with child
and not willing to lie with him, to...
find some temporary
consolation... elsewhere.
And for Kings,
it is properly expected.
Sweetheart,
listen to me.
The danger to you, and to us,
is not that the King takes a mistress...
but that he takes the wrong one.
Someone we can't control,
or who would seek to control the King.
But... if you suppose
the King is sure to take a mistress,
then make sure
she is your... choice,
and not... his.
I must make my report to the King.
I'll see you later.
- Mr. Secretary.
- Reverend Fisher.
I just came to see
if you were being well treated.
As to that, my... aged stomach
cannot cope with the rank food
the jailor brings.
But that is nothing, since it pertains
to my body and not my soul.
You have not taken the Oath.
No.
Why not?
Do you refuse to accept that
the King's marriage is proper and legal?
I believe His Majesty thinks it so.
But you don't?
No.
I believe what I have always believed...
that the King's marriage
to Queen Katherine is still valid,
and can be undone
by no man, not even...
Archbishop Cranmer.
And...
do you dispute that the King is
Supreme Head of the Church in England?
Yes, I do. Most emphatically.
The King our Sovereign Lord
is not the Supreme Head on earth
of the Church of England.
Tell me,
how is Sir Thomas More?
Jailor!
I will...
see if the quality of your food
can be improved.
Thank you.
Why did you get rid of Lady Eleanor?
She stole something precious from me.
- Are you sure she stole it?
- Yes.
I had the evidence. I had no choice.
I hope Your Majesty is not
too disappointed?
In any case,
I have something for you.
Your Majesty.
Elizabeth.
Thank you.
What's this?
Majesty, there are a number
of small monastic institutions
I have had cause to investigate.
The monks there refuse to take the Oath.
They'd rather serve
the Vicar of Rome than you.
This is a bill for their dissolution.
The very considerable wealth
of these houses
will thus be transferred
to Your Majesty's exchequer.
Well?
Majesty, I have just heard
that the Pope intends
to make Reverend Fisher a Cardinal.
Apparently he has already
dispatched a Cardinal's hat.
Then Fisher will have to wear it
upon his shoulders!
For by the time it gets here,
he won't have a head to put it on!
And what of More?
I want to know!
Will he take the oath?
How is she? Does she feed well?
She's good in every way, Majesty.
And hardly cries at all,
as if she already knows
that she's a Princess.
I love you, Elizabeth.
I love you with all my heart
and I bid you never forget it.
Your Majesty.
Before I leave, I wish to say
something to the Lady Mary.
Lady Mary...
Lady Mary, I am here in kindness.
I would welcome you back to court,
and reconcile you with your father,
if you will only accept me as Queen.
I recognize no Queen but my mother.
But if the King's mistress
would intercede
with the King on my behalf...
then I would be grateful.
Sir Thomas More.
Sir Thomas.
Mr. Secretary.
Please be seated.
This is but an informal occasion.
A little ale, perhaps?
No, thank you.
I'm sure we both know the object
which has brought us together.
It is very widely rumoured, Sir Thomas,
that you will refuse to take
the Oath of Succession.
I say this to you
very openly and sincerely,
that I wish no harm
to come to a great man
who has for years enjoyed and deserved
His Majesty's good graces.
I would rather lose my own son
than see any hurt come to you.
May I ask your opinion
of the King's new marriage?
I have no opinion.
I neither murmur at it,
nor dispute upon it.
I never did...
and never will.
Then what of His Majesty's claim
to Supremacy
over the Church in England?
I was unsure about this matter...
until I re-read
His Majesty's own pamphlet:
the "Assertio septum Sacramentorum."
In fact, I have...
I have a copy of it here.
Of course, in the pamphlet,
the King asserts
the divine origin of the papacy.
The Pope's supremacy descends directly
from the Rock of St. Peter.
I think you'll find
His Majesty's arguments are as...
persuasive and powerful now
as they were when he first wrote them.
Will you take the Oath?
I need hardly remind you
of the consequences of not doing so.
Mr. Secretary,
I am the King's loyal subject.
I say no harm,
I think no harm,
but I wish everybody good.
And if this be not enough
to keep a man alive, in good faith,
- I long not to live.
- Sir Thomas...
You should know that
the King himself has no mind
to coerce you.
He simply asks you to relent
and condescend to his request
that you take the Oath.
Mr. Cromwell, please impart to the King
my utter faithfulness,
truthfulness, and loyalty to him.
Cousin Madge.
Yes, Madam?
Come and talk to me.
I suppose you have many admirers?
Yes,
but I always remember
what Your Majesty told us,
about not being lewd
and setting a standard.
I'm sure you do.
But would it surprise you to learn
that one of your admirers
is the King?
- It's not true!
- It is true.
Now, would it surprise you even more
if I told you that
you would have my blessing
to become his mistress?
- Madam!
- While I am with child,
His Majesty needs to be able to lie
with another woman.
He is a passionate man.
But she must be someone I can trust.
Whose family I can trust,
like yours.
After all,
we are family.
And you are reformers.
Yes, Your Majesty.
We all gladly took the oath.
And now will you gladly
take the King to your bed?
His Excellency, the Imperial Ambassador.
- Excellency.
- Your Majesty.
Forgive me, but I come here
upon a mission of mercy.
- Mercy?
- Very much so.
Your daughter, the Lady Mary,
has fallen ill,
even to the concern of her doctors.
I have a letter written by her mother.
She would like to nurse her child.
She writes... if I may?
"A little comfort and mirth with me
would be a half health to her."
"I could care for her with my own hands
"and put her in my own bed
"and watch with her when needful."
I will send my personal physician
to examine and help her.
But I cannot allow Mary
and her mother to be together.
But, Your Majesty... it is just the cry
- of any mother for any daughter.
- But that's just it!
They are not just
any mother or daughter.
Do you not suppose
they would conspire to plot against me?
- I cannot believe it.
- Of course you can believe it!
You know it happens.
And that sometimes illness
is used for political purpose.
Do you not believe that Katherine
wants Mary to be Queen above all else?
Mr. Chapuys,
Lady Katherine is a very proud
stubborn woman
of very great and high courage.
She could muster an army, take the field
and wage a war against me
as fierce as any her mother Isabella
ever waged in Spain.
Is that not true?
I've been handed a summons
to appear at Lambeth Palace
to take the oath.
I imagine I shall be
imprisoned afterwards.
- No!
- Father!
You must be good to each other
and to everyone else.
Or, if you cannot be good,
be the least bad you can be.
Darling, no...
Ah! Lady Sheldon.
- Where's the Queen?
- Your Majesty,
the Queen is feeling indisposed
and asks you to forgive her
not riding this morning.
Of course.
She...
She wondered if Your Majesty
would be pleased if...
if I took her place.
Riding, I mean.
If the Queen gives her permission,
then why not?
Lady Sheldon.
What's your name, Lady Sheldon?
Margaret, Your Majesty.
Though people call me Madge.
Then I shall call you Madge,
if you'll allow me?
Of course, Your Majesty.
Sir Thomas.
Are you now ready to swear the oath?
May I see it?
Thank you.
Well?
I don't mean to put at fault
this oath or its makers
or any man who swears to it.
And I will never condemn
the conscience of any other man.
But for myself, in good faith,
my own conscience
so moves me that I will swear
to the validity of the succession,
yet not the rest of it,
without jeopardizing my soul
to perpetual damnation.
We are very sorry to hear you say this.
You are almost the first to refuse it
and your refusal will cause
the King's highness to be both
indignant and suspicious of you.
Here are all the members
of the Commons and the Lords
who have sworn to take the oath.
- The clergy too.
- I myself cannot swear.
But I do not blame any other man
who has sworn.
Sir Thomas, we have come
to the conclusion
that, far from being a true and loyal
servant to His Majesty,
there never was a servant so villainous,
so traitorous to his prince as you.
If you refuse to take the oath,
not only will you be imprisoned,
but the most horrid things imaginable
will be done to you.
My Lords, these threats
are for children, not for me.
Do you deny...
that you bullied and persuaded the King,
against his conscience,
to write this pamphlet against Luther?
Of course I deny it.
In the first place I never ask anyone,
be he ever so high or so low,
to act against his conscience.
And secondly,
I remember it was His Majesty
who rather persuaded me
of the paramount importance
of the papacy.
I ask you a final time,
before the awful penalties
are exacted upon you.
Why will you not swear?
Why will you not swear?
Madge!
What? Madge!
I don't know. It's funny.
Madge.
I like your dimples
when you laugh, Madge.
Madge.
Your Majesty.
Come here.
Let me...
examine your dimples
a little more closely.
Sir Thomas.
Thank you.
Oh, and... your Highness might like
to know that the Reverend Fisher
is lodged in the room down below.
Good day to you, sir.

Votre Majesté,
Sa Grâce l'Archevêque Cranmer est ici.
Votre Grâce.
Votre Majesté.
Nous avons eu un grand succès
pour le serment d'allégeance
à Votre Majesté
en tant que Chef de l'Église.
Ainsi qu'en faveur de votre mariage
à la Reine Anne.
Mais nous n'avons pu convaincre
ni Fisher ni Thomas More
de prêter serment.
Cependant,
ils sont disposés à le faire en partie.
Sir Thomas
nous a déjà dit n'avoir aucune
objection à l'édit de succession.
- Et...
- Non.
Il ne peut y avoir de compromis.
Si nous leurs permettons, à eux seuls,
de ne jurer que pour ce qui leur plaît,
ils créeront un précédent
qui sera suivi.
Pour cette affaire, votre Grâce,
c'est tout ou rien.
Votre Majesté.
- M. le Secrétaire.
- Votre Majesté.
Dame Alice,
la femme de Sir Thomas vous a écrit.
Elle tenait à vous rappeler que...
son époux a longtemps
été fidèle à votre service
et qu'il ne fait rien par méchanceté,
mais par acquit de conscience.
Je sais tout de sa conscience.
Il me l'a ouvertement étalée
pendant des années.
Lorsqu'il a démissionné, il m'a promis
de se retirer du monde
et de vivre à l'écart.
Et de soigner son âme.
Mais ce n'était que mensonge.
Il a continué à écrire des pamphlets
sur mon affaire et ma conscience.
Il a rendu visite à Catherine.
Il a imploré le soutien des autres.
En d'autres termes,
il a brisé sa promesse.
Il doit en accepter les conséquences.
Votre Majesté.
Sir Thomas, vous avez de la visite.
Merci.
- Thomas !
- Alice !
Margaret !
Alice !
Laissez-moi vous regarder.
Alors, Thomas More...
je m'étonne que vous
qui avez toujours été un homme si sage
acceptiez maintenant de
jouer au fou dans cette prison lugubre
et de vous plaire d'être enfermé
avec les rats et les souris.
Ne dites pas cela !
Je vous assure qu'il s'agit...
d'une des meilleures chambres
de la Tour.
En réalité,
officiellement,
je ne suis que l'invité du constable,
qui vous a amené ici.
Je lui ai dit auparavant
qu'au moindre signe
d'ingratitude de ma part
pour sa grande générosité,
il n'avait qu'à...
me renvoyer de la Tour.
Vous savez pourquoi nous sommes là.
Je pensais que c'était pour me voir.
Oui.
C'était pour vous voir.
Mais ce n'est pas tout,
c'était pour vous prier
de prêter serment
afin que vous puissiez rentrer
avec nous.
Alice, dites-moi une chose.
Quoi donc ?
Ne suis-je pas ici aussi près du paradis
que chez moi ?
Grand Dieu. Est-ce là tout
ce que vous avez à dire ?
Vous avez toujours été sincère
et j'ai toujours admiré cela chez vous.
Alors, je vous dirai sincèrement,
que moi... Margaret...
et le reste de votre famille
avons tous prêté serment
sans en éprouver la moindre gêne.
J'ai toujours dit que je ne blâmerais
aucun homme ou femme qui l'aurait fait,
mais que pour ma part,
je ne pouvais jurer.
Vous ne pensez donc qu'à vous.
Si vous êtes traduit en justice,
comme vous le savez,
tous vos biens
seront rendus à la Couronne.
Et nous serons forcés à la pauvreté.
Cette question m'a tenu éveillé
plus de nuits que je ne saurais dire.
Mais vous refusez toujours
de prêter serment !
Je vous prie de me comprendre
Je ne veux pas...
Je ne veux pas... mourir en martyr.
Je ferai tout mon possible
pour accommoder le Roi et ses désirs.
Nous devons nous rappeler
qu'il m'a, un jour, promis...
de ne jamais me forcer
à agir contre ma conscience,
de d'abord m'adresser à Dieu
et seulement ensuite à lui.
Alors, Margaret, ne soyez pas triste.
Alice,
dites-moi que vous n'êtes pas en colère.
Je vous en prie.
Si vous partiez
en me laissant cette impression
je me sentirais
encore plus seul qu'avant.
Non.
Je ne suis pas en colère contre vous.
Mais je suis terrifiée.
Tellement terrifiée.
Votre Majesté.
Milady...
Qu'y a-t-il, Votre Majesté ?
- Votre Majesté.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
Mon Dieu !
Mon Dieu !
Appelez le médecin.
J'ai perdu l'enfant.
Oui.
Ils me l'ont dit.
Nous ne ferons aucune annonce publique.
Non.
Merci, Votre Majesté.
Attendez.
M. Fisher,
je viens vous apporter deux nouvelles.
Tout d'abord,
le Pape vous a nommé Cardinal
mais la deuxième
est que le Parlement a décrété
que renier malicieusement
la suprématie du Roi
dans tous les domaines
est un acte de trahison,
passible de la peine de mort.
Alors... je vous le redemande :
Acceptez-vous le Roi
comme Chef suprême de l'Église,
et prêterez-vous serment ?
Vous connaissez déjà ma réponse.
Mes agents ont intercepté cette lettre.
Elle était destinée à l'Empereur.
Son auteur y supplie l'Empereur
d'envahir l'Angleterre
et de restaurer,
ce qu'il se plaît à nommer,
"la véritable Reine"
et "la véritable foi".
Avez-vous écrit cette lettre ?
En temps voulu, M. Fisher,
vous serez accusé de trahison
et jugé au bon vouloir de Sa Majesté.
M. le Secrétaire,
je vous remercie de m'avoir informé
de ma nomination.
Au moins, il n'y avait pas
que des mauvaises nouvelles.
Cardinal.
<i>Pardonnez-moi, Ambassadeur,
de vous recevoir ainsi.</i>
Je suis triste
de vous voir si mal en point.
Est-ce si surprenant ?
J'ai reçu la visite du...
Duc de Wiltshire et d'autres
cherchant à me faire prêter serment,
et me menaçant si je ne le faisais pas.
Boleyn dit que je serais
envoyée à l'échafaud.
Cet homme me semble sincèrement
être un suppôt de Satan.
Dites-moi, comment va
le pauvre Évêque Fisher ?
Le Parlement a passé un nouvel...
édit de trahison.
Il rend le "déni malicieux"
de la suprématie du roi,
passible de mort.
Pauvre Fisher.
Il m'a défendue comme un lion.
Et il va mourir seul
et misérablement dans une prison.
Quelle en était la cause ?
Aucune.
Il a dû se passer quelque chose.
Qu'avez-vous fait pour tuer le bébé ?
Je n'ai rien fait.
Je ne sais pas.
Croyez-moi, Père.
J'étais si prévenante.
Mais pas suffisamment.
À présent,
nous allons tous devoir faire attention,
vous en particulier,
à ne pas perdre l'amour du Roi.
Ou tout sera perdu.
Tout.
Pour nous tous.
Charles, je voudrais
vous poser une question.
Avez-vous déjà couché avec une femme
vous ayant menti sur sa virginité ?
Sur sa virginité ?
Je dirais ça autrement :
"n'ayant pas menti dessus" ?
Pourquoi cette question ?
Que Votre Majesté me pardonne.
Ce n'est pas grave.
Je cherchais la vérité
et vous me l'avez dite.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Descendez de votre cheval !
Descendez immédiatement !
Descendez !
Bonjour.
Bonjour, Votre Majesté.
- Comment vous nommez-vous ?
- William Webbe, Votre Majesté.
Non.
Le nom de votre bien-aimée ?
Bess, Votre Majesté.
Approchez, Bess.
Je vous assure, Votre Majesté...
que j'ai permis et autorisation
de traverser la forêt de Votre Majesté.
Je vous le jure
et peux aisément le prouver.
Bonjour, Bess.
Votre Majesté.
Venez avec moi.
Formez les rangs !
Êtes-vous vraiment le Roi d'Angleterre ?
Non.
Ce n'était qu'une moquerie.
<i>Notre ami anglais écrit</i>
que "La Lady n'aura
finalement pas d'enfant."
Il dit également que le Roi
lui a déjà été infidèle.
Mais cela ne veut peut-être rien dire
"compte tenu
du caractère changeant du Roi
"et du pouvoir de la Lady,
"qui sait très bien le manipuler."
Vous et moi avons
bien réussi à éviter
le pouvoir des femmes.
Le célibat est un grand soulagement.
Oui, Votre Sainteté.
Mais notre ami craint encore
pour la vie de la Reine Catherine
et de sa fille,
aucune des deux n'étant en sécurité
tant que la concubine a de l'influence.
J'enverrai mes prières
à nos deux chères sœurs
et au Cardinal Fisher.
Que Dieu lui donne le courage
d'endurer son supplice.
- Oui, Votre Sainteté.
- D'un autre côté...
Oui ?
D'un autre côté,
à l'époque des fondateurs
de notre Église,
mourir en martyr
était considéré comme un privilège,
comme Saint-Pierre et les apôtres.
Notre Église a été bâtie
sur le sang de ses martyrs.
Il est peut-être dommage
que vous et moi, Campeggio,
contrairement au Cardinal Fisher,
n'ayons plus l'opportunité
de mourir pour le Christ.
Sir Thomas.
Sir Thomas !
Je suis là.
Je suis là. Qui êtes-vous ?
John,
un serviteur de l'Évêque Fisher,
qui est enfermé en dessous.
Il vous demande de vous réjouir.
Comment va-t-il ?
Pour dire vrai, il est vieux et malade.
Il ne peut manger
la nourriture qu'on lui sert.
Mais son esprit reste invaincu.
Je suis heureux de l'entendre.
Ceci ne me surprend guère.
Il demande si, de guerre lasse,
vous prêteriez serment
et dans quelles circonstances ?
Dites-lui que je ne puis prêter serment
sans damner mon âme pour l'éternité.
Et cela, je m'y refuse.
Merci, Sir.
Je sais que cela ravivera
le courage de mon maître.
Je dois y aller.
Que Dieu vous bénisse.
Dites-moi, M. Cromwell,
Thomas More reste-t-il enfermé
dans son obstination ?
Oui.
Obligez-le à donner
les raisons de son refus,
ou je jugerais son silence
comme étant malveillant.
Je vous nomme Vice régent
pour les affaires spirituelles.
Il est vrai que vous êtes un laïc,
mais pour cette affaire, je ne crois pas
aux préjugés d'un religieux.
Milady, votre sœur est ici.
Ma sœur.
Mary !
Votre Majesté.
Vous attendez un enfant !
Comment est-ce arrivé ?
Nous n'en savions rien.
Je suis mariée.
Mariée ?
Alors...
qui est votre époux ?
Il se nomme M. William Stafford.
Je ne le connais pas.
Est-il à la cour ?
Il...
William est un homme
de rang inférieur et sans fortune.
Il sert en tant que soldat à Calais.
Vous pensez donc qu'il est...
assez riche pour être l'époux
de la sœur de la Reine d'Angleterre ?
- Oui, Père. Je l'aime et je...
- Vous êtes totalement dans l'erreur.
Vous l'avez épousé en secret
et sans demander notre approbation.
C'est un petit, vous n'auriez
jamais eu notre permission.
Père, si vous acceptiez
de le rencontrer, vous verriez
que c'est un homme bon et honnête.
Puisque vous avez agi
de façon éhontée et sans mon accord,
je suis tenu
de vous retirer votre rente.
Vous et votre... jeune et honnête mari
pouvez brûler en enfer,
en ce qui me concerne.
Anne !
Pensez-vous qu'il m'a été facile
de trouver un mari adéquat,
alors qu'on me nommait
"la grande prostituée" !
En effet, j'ai de la chance d'avoir
connu William, et d'être aimée de lui.
Vous n'avez pas demandé ma permission.
Dois-je avoir votre permission
pour être amoureuse ?
Oui !
Nous sommes de la Royauté.
Tout est différent.
Je vous en prie.
Je vous en prie...
Ma sœur.
Non.
Votre époux et vous
êtes bannis de la cour.
Votre Honneur.
M. Cromwell,
en quoi puis-je vous être agréable ?
Il me serait extrêmement agréable
que vous me donniez la raison
ou les raisons qui vous empêchent
de prêter ce serment.
J'ai...
libéré mon esprit
de toutes ces questions,
et je ne discuterai plus
des titres du Roi
... ou du Pape.
Le Roi vous accuse d'entêtement
et d'opiniâtreté car
vous n'exprimez point vos raisons.
Vous devez avoir
une vision particulière de cette loi.
Ma vision est que...
l'édit du parlement est comme
une épée à double tranchant
car si un homme répond d'une façon,
il met en péril son corps
et s'il répond d'une autre...
il met en péril son âme.
Mais votre retenue
vous exposera à des sanctions.
Sa Majesté m'a ordonné
d'établir un édit de disgrâce
contre vous.
Cela rendra
votre emprisonnement permanent.
Pauvre Alice.
Sir Thomas,
pourquoi ne pas prêter serment ?
Des milliers l'ont fait.
Beaucoup partagent
vos croyances et votre foi.
Mais non pas vos scrupules.
Certains le font pour en tirer avantage,
d'autres par crainte.
D'autres pensent
qu'ils pourront se confesser
et que Dieu leur pardonnera.
D'autres, enfin, pensent que s'ils...
disent une chose et pensent autrement,
leur serment ira vers ce qu'ils pensent
et non vers ce qu'ils disent.
Mais je ne peux user de ces subterfuges
pour une affaire aussi importante.
Dans ce cas,
et en toute honnêteté,
Sir Thomas,
vous serez à même
d'en subir les conséquences.
M. Cromwell, il n'y a vraiment
aucune différence entre nous,
à l'exception du fait que
je mourrai aujourd'hui,
et vous demain.
Excusez-moi,
n'êtes-vous pas Margaret More,
la fille de Sir Thomas ?
Oui, Monsieur.
Je suis Eustace Chapuis,
l'Ambassadeur de l'Empereur.
C'est un plaisir pour moi de rencontrer
quelqu'un de l'entourage de Thomas More.
Merci, Votre Excellence.
Puis-je savoir la raison
de votre venue ici ?
Je viens présenter une requête
à M. le Secrétaire Cromwell.
La majorité de nos terres
ont été vendues,
et ma famille est progressivement
réduite à la pauvreté.
Ma mère ne parvient pas
à assurer notre pitance.
Je suis désolé de l'entendre.
Nombreux faits
dans ce Royaume me désolent.
Les bons semblent souffrir,
et les méchants prospèrent.
- Mark !
- Majesté ?
Vous êtes un esprit libre.
J'adore ça.
Je suis cerné d'interdits.
Nul ne me comprend.
Ne me quittez jamais.
Ma sœur ?
Je n'arrive pas à dormir.
Je suis désolée.
Et pourquoi n'y parvenez-vous pas ?
Je pense à elle...
Qui donc ?
Vous pensez à qui ?
À Lady Mary, bien sûr.
Et à sa mère.
Catherine.
Oui. Catherine !
Qu'est-ce qui vous arrive ?
Je ne comprends pas.
- Quel mal peuvent-elles vous causer ?
- Tout le mal !
Tant que Mary est vivante...
- elle pourrait être Reine.
- Non !
L'édit de succession
rend cela impossible.
Elizabeth,
votre fille,
sera faite héritière du trône.
Mais le Roi peut changer d'avis.
À présent, il peut faire
tout ce qu'il désire.
Il a un pouvoir absolu. Vous le savez !
Et ce qu'il a donné,
il peut le reprendre.
Et ce qu'il a repris,
il peut le redonner.
Et il pourrait faire
de Mary une Reine,
au détriment de ma fille.
Pourquoi le ferait-il ?
Je l'ignore, j'en ai juste peur.
Ce que je sais de Mary,
c'est qu'elle sera
la cause de ma mort...
et moi de la sienne.
<i>Benedicant te domine,</i>
<i>omnes angeli et santi tui.</i>
<i>Benedicant te caeli, terra, mare,</i>
<i>et omnia quae in eis sunt.</i>
<i>In te speravi, domine.</i>
<i>Tu es Deus meus,</i>
- Thomas !
- In...
- Sir Thomas !
- John ?
C'est vous, John ?
Mon maître a été déclaré coupable
et sera exécuté demain.
Il espère vous revoir
bientôt au paradis.
Dites-lui que là-bas
sera notre rencontre,
car la voie que nous empruntons
y mène indubitablement.
John,
dites-lui...
qu'il mérite et qu'il recevra
- toutes les grâces du paradis.
- Oui, Sir.
Dieu vous bénisse, Sir.
Dieu vous bénisse.
Au nom du Père,
du Fils et du Saint-Esprit.
Voyez que je porte
mes plus beaux atouts,
car ce jour est mon jour de noce.
Brave gens, je vous demande de...
d'aimer votre Roi et de lui obéir,
car au fond de lui,
c'est un homme bon...
même s'il a tort
dans ses orientations religieuses.
Mais je suis condamné à périr
pour avoir voulu défendre
l'honneur de Dieu et du Saint-Siège.
À présent,
bons chrétiens, je demande vos prières.
Je ne suis que chair et comme
tout homme, je crains la mort.
Il est vrai que depuis fort longtemps
je me suis préparé à la mort,
si nécessaire,
pour le Christ et son Église, mais...
maintenant que le moment est proche,
j'ai besoin de votre aide.
Dieu vous bénisse, Cardinal Fisher.
Dieu vous bénisse...
- Dieu vous bénisse, Cardinal Fisher.
- Dieu vous bénisse !
<i>Pas de cette façon, abruti !</i>
<i>Moïse ressemble...</i>
<i>à un tas de crottin.</i>
- Saint-Père.
- Connaissez-vous cet homme ?
Non.
Michelagniolo di Ludovico
di Lionardo di Buonnarroti Simoni.
Michel-Ange ?
- C'était lui ?
- En effet.
Nous lui pardonnons car c'est un génie.
Quelqu'en soit la signification.
Saint-Père, nous venons d'apprendre
l'exécution du Cardinal Fisher.
Sa tête a été tranchée.
J'en ai eu vent, c'est un outrage.
J'ai fait de Fisher
un Prince de l'Église,
mais cela importait peu au Roi Henry,
qui est tellement vautré
dans le vice et la luxure
que cela lui fait perdre la raison.
Magnifique !
Majesté, maintenant que Fisher est mort,
qu'avez-vous décidé au sujet de More ?
Il nous faudra continuer, M. Cromwell.
Il nous faudra continuer.
Père, que se passe-t-il ?
Il me semble
qu'ils vous traitent pire qu'avant.
Ils ont pris mon poêle.
Quelques vêtements.
Ma ration a été réduite.
- Père, comment pouvez-vous...
- Margaret,
ne vous préoccupez pas de moi.
J'ai longtemps réfléchi
au sujet de la passion
et du supplice du Christ et...
je ne crains pas la mort.
Je n'ai peur que de la torture.
S'il venait à utiliser la violence
pour me faire jurer
j'ignore si je serais aussi courageux.
Mais vous n'avez pas
à supporter tout cela.
Prêtez serment !
Comme j'ai fait.
Comme chacun de nous a fait.
Faites-le et votre corps sera épargné.
Mais l'épargne de mon corps
se fera aux dépens de mon âme.
- Non !
- Si.
Non...
Aucun d'entre nous ne le pense.
Père, je vous en prie.
Je vous en prie !
Pour tout l'amour que vous nous portez,
ne nous faites pas cela.
M. le Secrétaire,
Sir Richard Rich.
Sir Richard...
je suis ravi de vous voir.
J'ai...
une mission pour vous.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi n'est-il pas comme les autres ?
Pourquoi doit-il me contrarier ?
Pourquoi son orgueil serait
supérieur à celui du Roi ?
Cela me tourmente.
Il pèse sur ma conscience
et mon cœur est affligé et souffrant.
Je ne le dis qu'à vous
et ne peut le confesser qu'à vous.
Je l'aime !
Et je le hais !
Je le hais autant que je l'aime,
car il est l'esprit que je rejette.
À vous de juger, s'il restera
ou non sur ma conscience !
Sir Richard.
Bonjour à vous.
Je vois que ma cellule est vite devenue
l'endroit de réunion des avocats.
Pardonnez-moi, Thomas,
ma venue ici m'a été imposée
car j'ai ordre de vous priver de tout...
livres, papiers... et autres.
Cela est regrettable.
Mais, du moment que l'on vous
en a donné l'ordre, je suppose...
je suppose qu'il n'y a
aucune autre solution.
Vous devriez commencer.
Puis-je vous poser une question ?
Qu'elle ne soit que théorique, Richard.
C'est mieux ainsi.
Alors, supposons que...
le parlement émette un édit
disant que moi,
Richard Rich, suis Roi,
et qu'il serait de la trahison
de le renier.
M'accepteriez-vous comme Roi ?
Oui.
Mais laissez-moi répliquer
par un autre cas théorique.
Supposons que le Parlement décide que...
Dieu n'est pas Dieu,
et s'opposer à cet édit
serait de la trahison.
Diriez-vous que "Dieu n'est pas Dieu" ?
Non, car aucun parlement
ne peut émettre une loi pareille.
Il n'a aucune compétence
pour décider de l'existence de Dieu.
Et aucun Parlement ne peut faire
d'un Roi le Chef suprême de l'Église.
Voilà, Thomas.
Je crois que ma mission est terminée.
Votre Majesté,
le Roi est ici.
Milady.
Venez ici.
Avez-vous encore
de la passion pour moi ?
Bien sûr, ma chérie.
Je vous aime.
À présent,
ne pleurez plus.
Ne pleurez plus, ma chérie.
Tout va bien.
Tout va se passer pour le mieux.
Sir Thomas More, vous comparaissez
devant cette commission
pour haute trahison.
Qu'avez-vous à dire pour votre défense ?
Laissez-moi commencer par...
nier le fait de m'être
malicieusement opposé
au mariage du Roi avec Anne Boleyn.
Je ne me suis jamais exprimé
malicieusement contre lui,
seulement parfois,
en accord avec mon esprit,
mes opinions et ma conscience,
et j'en ai assumé les conséquences.
Mais vous avez malicieusement
rejeté l'édit de suprématie.
Non, je n'en ai dit mot.
Et au regard de mon silence,
vos lois ni aucune loi sur terre
n'est capable de me condamner
avec justice et droiture.
À moins que vous n'ajoutiez
à mes charges, certains...
mots ou actes.
Votre silence pourrait aisément
être considéré comme une action.
Mais même dans ce cas,
la présomption d'innocence
que le silence apporte
exclut les charges à mon encontre.
"Qui ne dit mot consent."
Il vous est reproché d'avoir conspiré
en prison avec l'Évêque Fisher,
condamné pour trahison.
Je ne l'ai jamais rencontré en prison.
Je n'ai parlé qu'à son serviteur,
sur des sujets d'ordre familiaux.
et certaines consignes,
tel qu'il est d'usage
au vu de notre longue amitié.
Revenons à votre présumé
silence sur l'édit de suprématie.
Nous pensons que vous avez
émis des avis dessus.
Un témoin le confirmera.
Appelez l'adjoint du Procureur Général.
<i>Appellez M. Richard Rich.</i>
Vous êtes sous serment, Richard.
Rapportez-nous en toute honnêteté,
ce que vous a dit l'accusé à ce sujet.
Oui, Sir.
Nous avions conclu que le Parlement
ne pouvait émettre une loi
que Dieu n'était pas Dieu.
Ce à quoi Sir Thomas a répondu :
"Et aucun Parlement ne peut faire
d'un Roi le Chef suprême de l'Église."
Il a donc malicieusement
renié l'autorité du Roi ?
Selon ces dires ?
Oui, Sir.
Selon ces propres dires.
Je charge donc cette commission
d'apporter un verdict équitable.
Je vous demande, Messieurs,
de déterminer si
Sir Thomas More a conversé
avec Sir Richard Rich
de la façon rapportée ?
Vous le trouvez donc coupable.
Je poursuis par rendre le jugement
à l'encontre du prisonnier.
Milord...
Quand j'étais avocat, la bienséance
était de demander au prisonnier
avant que le jugement ne soit rendu
pourquoi celui-ci ne devrait pas
être rendu contre lui.
Qu'en est-il alors, êtes-vous
apte à dire le contraire ?
Merci.
À mon avis,
cette accusation est...
fondée sur une loi du Parlement,
totalement contraire aux lois divines
et de Sa Sainte Église.
Une autorité suprême
que nul Prince sur terre
aidé de toutes les lois
ne peut prétendre détenir.
Cela est dévolu...
de droit au Saint-Siège de Rome,
à Saint-Pierre et à ses successeurs.
Comme notre Sauveur nous l'a indiqué
quand il était sur terre.
Ce Royaume...
qui n'est qu'une partie
infime de l'Église,
ne peut émettre aucune loi spécifique
contrariant les lois communes
de l'Église catholique universelle.
Ce Royaume d'Angleterre ne peut
refuser obéissance à Rome,
autant qu'un enfant...
ne peut refuser obéissance
à son père naturel !
Maintenant, nous voyons
clairement votre penchant malveillant.
Non, Messieurs,
je n'ai aucune malveillance.
Je souhaite vous revoir tous au paradis.
Et j'implore Dieu Tout-Puissant
de préserver et défendre
Sa Majesté le Roi.
Et de lui envoyer...
de bons conseillers.
Sir Thomas More,
vous serez traîné sur une claie
à travers la ville de Londres,
jusqu'à Tyburn.
Vous y serez pendu
sans que mort s'ensuive.
Par la suite...
vous serez eventré,
vos viscères ôtés de votre corps
et brûlés devant vos yeux.
Vos parties intimes seront coupées.
Votre tête tranchée.
Votre corps sera divisé
en quatre parties.
Bénissez-nous, mon père.
Je vous bénis, mes enfants.
Réjouissez-vous,
car j'ai prié pour qu'on soit
à nouveau ensemble au paradis.
L'exécution est pour quand ?
Demain, Votre Majesté.
Quel jour est-ce ?
Le 6 juillet.
À quelle heure ?
À dix heures du matin.
J'ai décidé de commuter
la sentence en décapitation.
Informez les officiels.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
<i>Pietate tua, quaessumus Domine,</i>
<i>nostrorum solve vincula peccatorum.</i>
<i>Et intercedente
beata Maria semper virgine.</i>
<i>Nos famulos tuos</i>
<i>in omni sanctitate custodi.</i>
<i>Per Christum.</i>
<i>Dominum nostrum.</i>
Merci, Sir Humphrey.
Mais si je m'écroule à nouveau,
permettez-moi de me relever
du mieux que je peux.
Je vous prends comme témoins
que je vais maintenant
subir la mort, dans...
et pour la foi
de la Sainte Église catholique.
Je vous supplie sincèrement
de prier pour le Roi.
Dites-lui...
que je suis mort en bon serviteur
mais avant tout celui de Dieu.
Je demande votre pardon
et votre bénédiction.
Vous me donnerez en ce jour
un profit qu'aucun mortel
ne pourra être en mesure de me donner.
Reprenez votre esprit, brave homme,
et ne craignez pas
de faire votre office.

<i>Previously... </i>
The high and mighty
Princess of England,
<i>There can be no question
of her legitimacy.</i>
<i>The line of succession is now
firmly vested in our children.</i>
The union between King Henry
of England and Catherine of Aragon
is declared null and void.
The Act of Succession will also require
recognition of the King's supremacy
in all matters.
So it must be sworn by oath after all.
Those who refuse are put in prison.
Like our brother in Christ.
Bishop Fisher.
I would reconcile you with your father
if you will only accept me as Queen.
I recognize no Queen but my mother.
<i>Lady Katherine is a very proud,
stubborn woman.</i>
Do you not believe that Catherine
wants Mary to be Queen above all else?
It is very widely rumored
that you will refuse to take the oath.
I need hardly remind you
of the consequences of not doing so.
If I thought my wife and children
would encourage me to die
in a good cause
I would merrily run to death.
<i>I have decided
to make Fisher a cardinal.</i>
<i>You will send his hat to England.
Let's see if the king</i>
is still prepared
to prosecute and torture
a Prince of the Church.
I am with child again.
I will still give you a son.
And what of More?
Will he take the oath?
<i>There never was a servant so villainous,</i>
so traitorous to his Prince as you.
Why will you not swear?
I say no harm, I think no harm.
<i>And if this be not enough
to keep a man alive, I long not to live.</i>

THE TUDORS
Season 2 - Episode 5
[ www.seriessub.com ]
Majesty,
His Grace Archbishop Cranmer is here.
Your Grace.
Your Majesty...
we have had a great success
throughout the whole country
in the swearing of allegiance
to Your Majesty as Head of the Church.
Also in favor of your marriage
to Queen Anne.
But we cannot persuade
either Fisher or Thomas More
to swear the oath.
However... they may swear to part of it.
Sir Thomas has already told us he has no
argument with
the Act of Succession, and...
There can be no compromise.
For if we allow them, of all men,
to swear to what they like,
then they set a precedent
for others to follow.
In this matter, Your Grace,
it is all or nothing.
Majesty.
- Mr. Secretary.
- Majesty,
Dame Alice,
the wife of Sir Thomas has written.
She asks to remind you that
her husband has given long and
true service, and he does
nothing now out of malice, but only
in the imperative of his conscience.
I know all about his conscience.
He's been wearing it
on his sleeve for years.
When he resigned as Chancellor,
he made me a promise
that he would retire from the world
and live privately,
and attend his soul.
But this was not true.
He continued to publish pamphlets
about my matter and my conscience.
He visited Katherine.
He cajoled others to support her.
In other words, he broke his promise.
He must accept the consequences.
Majesty.
Sir Thomas, you have visitors.
Thank you.
- Thomas!
- Alice!
Margaret!
Alice!
Look at you...
Well, Thomas More,
I marvel that you have always
been taken for so wise a man
that you will now play the fool
here in this close, filthy prison
and be content apparently to be shut up
among mice and rats.
Don't be like that!
I assure you this is
one of the very best rooms in the Tower.
In fact,
formally, I am a guest of the Constable,
who just brought you here.
And I said to him before
that if I showed
the least sign of ingratitude
for his great generosity, he should just
throw me out of the Tower altogether!
You know why we have come here.
I thought it was to see me.
Yes.
It was to see you.
But beyond that,
it was to ask you to swear the oath,
so that you can come home with us.
Alice, tell me one thing.
What is that?
Is not this house
as close to heaven as my own?
Good God, man. Is that all you can say?
You were always plain speaking woman.
One of the attributes I admire you for.
Well, then I should
tell you plainly, husband,
that I, and Margaret...
and all your other family...
have all sworn the oath
and feel no worse for it.
I have always said that I do not
blame any other man or woman,
who has sworn.
I only say that I myself cannot swear.
Then you are thinking only of yourself.
If you are proceeded against,
as you know very well,
all your possessions
will be forfeited to the Crown.
And we would be forced into penury.
I have had more sleepless nights
over that issue than over anything else.
- But still you will not swear?
- Alice...
I want you to understand,
please. I do not...
I do not willingly seek martyrdom.
I will do everything I can
to accommodate the King and his desires.
We must remember that,
he once made me a promise
that he would never force me to do
anything against my conscience.
To look first unto God,
and only after unto him.
So, Margaret, don't be sad.
And Alice,
say you are not angry with me.
Please.
If you left, and I thought so,
I would feel
I feel even more lonely than before.
I am not angry with you.
But I am frightened.
So very frightened.
Your Majesty.
My Lady...
- What is it?
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- My Lady...
What is it?
Oh my God.
Get the physician.
I lost the baby.
Yes.
They told me.
We shall make
no public announcement of the fact.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Stand by.
Mr. Fisher.
I came to bring you two pieces of news.
In the first place,
the Pope has made you a Cardinal...
But the second is that Parliament
has decreed
that to maliciously deny
the King's supremacy in all matters,
is now a treasonable offence,
punishable by death.
So I ask you again.
Will you accept the King
as the Supreme Head of the Church,
and take the oath?
You already know my answer to that.
My agents intercepted this letter.
Its intended recipient was the Emperor.
In it, the writer begs the Emperor
to invade England
and restore what he is pleased to call
the true Queen and the true faith.
Did you write this letter?
In due course, Mr. Fisher,
you are to be arraigned for treason,
and you are to be tried
according to his Majesty's pleasure.
Mr. Secretary,
I must thank you,
for bringing word of my new hat.
At least it was not all bad news.
Cardinal.
<i>Forgive me, Ambassador,
for receiving you like this.</i>
I am sad to find Your Majesty so unwell.
Is it so surprising?
I have received visits from
the Earl of Wiltshire and others,
trying to make me take the oath,
and threatening me when I did not.
Boleyn said I should be sent
to the scaffold.
I truly believe that man
to be an emissary of Satan.
Tell me, what news
of poor Bishop Fisher?
Parliament has passed
a new Treasons Act.
Which makes "malicious" denial
of the King's supremacy,
punishable by death.
Poor Fisher.
He was a lion in my defense.
Now he will die alone
and ashamed in a prison cell.
What caused it?
There was nothing.
Of course there was something!
What did you do to kill the baby?
I didn't.
I don't know.
Believe me, father, I was so careful.
Welle, not careful enough.
Now...
From now on we must all be careful.
You especially.
Not to lose the King's love.
Or everything is lost.
Everything!
For all of us!
Charles. I wanted to ask you a question.
Have any of the women you've bedded
ever lied about their virginity?
Their virginity?
I'd say it's the other way around.
Did any of them not lie about it?
Why do you ask?
I ask Your Majesty's forgiveness.
It doesn't matter.
I asked for the truth,
and you told me so.
What's this?
Dismount your horse. Dismount now!
Down!
Good morrow.
Good morrow, Your Majesty.
What's your name?
William Webbe, Your Majesty.
your sweetheart's name?
Bess, Your Majesty.
Come here, Bess.
I assure Your Majesty
I have a permit and permission
to ride through Your Majesty's forest.
I swear it and could easily prove it.
Hello, Bess.
Your Majesty.
Come with me.
Former!
Are you really the King of England?
I was only pulling your leg.
<i>Our English friend writes</i>
that "the Lady
is not to have a child after all."
He also says that the King
has already been unfaithful to her,
But all this may mean nothing,
"considering
the changeable character of the King
"and the craft of the Lady,
"who well knows how to manage him."
You and I, Campeggio, have done well
to avoid the craft of women.
Celibacy is an immense relief.
Yes, Holy Father.
But our friend is still
fearful for the lives
of Queen Katherine and her daughter.
Neither of them is safe
as long as the concubine has power.
I will have prayers
said for our dear sisters
and also for Cardinal Fisher.
May God grant him the courage
to endure his tribulations.
- Yes, Holy Father.
- On the other hand...
Yes?
On the other hand,
in the days of
the founders of our Church,
it was considered
a privilege to be martyred,
like St. Peter and the other apostles.
Our Church was founded
upon the blood of these martyrs.
So perhaps it is a pity
that you and I, Campeggio,
unlike Cardinal Fisher,
no longer have the opportunity
to die for Christ.
Sir Thomas.
Sir Thomas!
Yes. I'm here.
I'm here. Who are you?
John. A servant to Bishop Fisher,
who is kept below here.
He asks you to be of good cheer.
How is he?
Truth be told, Sir,
he is old and not well.
He cannot eat the food here.
But his spirit remains ever unbroken.
Well, I am glad to hear it.
And not the least bit surprised.
He asks if you would ever
contemplate taking the oath...
and under what circumstances?
Tell him that I cannot take the oath
without damning my soul
for all eternity.
And that I will not do.
Thank you, Sir, for that.
I know it will renew
my master's courage.
Now I must go.
God bless you.
Tell me, Mr. Cromwell,
does Sir Thomas More
still continue in his stubbornness?
- Yes.
- You will force him to give his reasons
for not taking the oath, or I will deem
his silence to be malicious.
I am appointing you
Vice-Regent in Spiritual Matters.
It's true you are a layman
not a churchman
but in this matter I could not trust
the prejudices of any churchman.
My Lady, your sister has come.
Sister.
Mary?
Your Majesty.
You are with child!
How has it happened? We knew nothing.
I'm married.
Married?
So...
who is your husband?
His name is Mr. William Stafford.
I haven't heard of him. Is he at court?
He...
William is a man
of little standing and no fortune.
He is now a serving soldier in Calais.
Then you think him
worthy to be the husband
of the Queen of England's sister?
Yes, father. Since I love him and I...
You are very much mistaken.
You married him in secret,
and without asking our approval.
He is such a nothing, we could never
have given our permission!
Father, if you were to meet him,
you would see that he is
a good, fine, honest man.
Since you acted brazenly
and in spite of me, Mary,
I shall cut off your allowance.
You and your fine, honest young man
can rot in hell,
as far as I am concerned.
Anne...
How easy do you think it was for me
to find a proper husband,
when I was called the great prostitute!
Indeed I think myself fortunate
to have found William,
- and to be loved by him.
- You did not ask my permission.
Do I have to ask your permission
to fall in love?
Yes.
Now we are royalty.
Everything is different.
Please.
Please.
Sister.
You and your husband
are banished from court.
Your Honor,
Mr. Cromwell,
How may I please you?
It would please me very much
if you could give me the reason
or reasons
why you will not take the oath.
I have...
discharged my mind of all such matters,
and will no more
dispute King's titles,
nor Pope's.
The King accuses you of stubbornness
and obstinacy,
for not giving your reasons.
You must have some view of the statute?
I have this view that the
act of Parliament is like
a double-edged sword,
for ever a man answers one way
it confounds his body,
and if he answers another
it confounds his soul.
But if you did not answer at all,
you will incur penalties.
His Majesty has commanded me to draw up
an act of attainder against you.
This will make your imprisonment
permanent.
Poor Alice.
Sir Thomas,
why will you not take the oath?
Thousands have.
Many, I am sure,
share your beliefs and your faith.
And yet, not your scruples.
Well, as for that,
some may do it for favor,
and some for fear.
And some may perhaps think
they can later repent and be shriven,
and God will forgive them.
And some others
may be of a mind that if they
say one thing, but think another,
then their oath goes upon what they
think and not upon what they say.
But I cannot use such ways
in so great a matter.
In which case,
and in all honesty,
Sir Thomas,
you are likely to pay
the ultimate price.
Mr. Cromwell, there really
is no difference between us,
except that I shall die today,
and you tomorrow.
Forgive me,
but aren't you Margaret More,
Sir Thomas' daughter?
Yes, sir.
I am Eustace Chapuys,
the Emperor's Ambassador.
It is a great pleasure for me to meet
anyone associated with Thomas More.
Thank you, Your Excellency.
May I ask why you have come to court?
I have come to petition
Mr. Secretary Cromwell.
Lately most of our lands
have been sold off
and my family is gradually
reduced to poverty.
Things go very hard with my mother.
I am sorry to hear it.
I am sorry for many things
that are occurring in this kingdom.
The good seem to suffer,
and the wicked to prosper.
- Oh! Mark!
- Majesty?
You're a free spirit. I love that.
Everyone else constrains me.
No one understands.
Never leave me.
Sister?
I couldn't sleep. I'm sorry.
Why could you not sleep?
I was thinking of her!
Who? Thinking of who?
The Lady Mary, of course.
And her mother!
Katherine.
Yes. Katherine!
What's wrong with you?
I don't understand.
- What harm can they do you now?
- Every harm!
As long as Mary is alive,
- then she could be Queen.
- No.
The Act of Succession
makes it impossible.
Elizabeth,
your daughter
will be made heir to the throne.
But the King can change his mind!
He can do whatever he wills now.
He has absolute power. You know that!
And what he has given,
he can take away,
and what taken away, he can give back.
And he could still make Mary Queen,
even above my daughter.
But why should he?
I don't know. I just fear it.
This is all I know of Mary,
that she is my death,
and I am hers!
Benedicant te, Domine,
omnes angeli et santi tui.
Benedicant te caeli, terra, mare,
et omnia quae in eis sunt.
In te speravi, Domine.
Tu es Deus meus,
- Thomas!
- In...
- Sir Thomas!
- John...
Is that you, John?
My master, Cardinal Fisher,
is found guilty
and is called forth tomorrow.
He hopes you and he shall soon
meet in heaven.
Tell him that will be the way,
for it is a very strait gate we are in.
John...
tell him
he deserves and will receive
all of heaven's graces.
Yes, Sir.
God bless you, Sir.
God bless you.
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.
You see that I am wearing
my finest clothes,
for today is my wedding day!
Good people, I ask you to
love the King and obey him,
for he is good by nature...
even if he is not right
in his religious policies.
But I am condemned to die
for wishing to uphold the honor of God
and the Holy See.
And now,
good Christian people,
I ask for your prayers.
I am only flesh,
and fear death as much as any man.
It's true that I have
long since made up my mind to die,
if need be,
for Christ and His Church, but...
now that the moment is at hand,
I need your help.
God bless you, Cardinal Fisher.
- Holy Father!
- Do you know who that was?
Michelagniolo di Ludovico
di Lionardo di Buonnarroti Simoni.
Michelangelo?
- That was him?
- That was him.
We forgive him because he is a genius.
Whatever that means.
Holiness, we have heard from England
of the murder of Cardinal Fisher.
His head was struck
from his body with an axe.
I have already heard. It is an outrage.
I had made Fisher
a Prince of the Church...
but it mattered nothing to King Henry,
who is now so mired in vice and lust
that he is beyond reason.
Magnificent!
Majesty, now that Fisher is dead,
what is to be done about More?
We should press ahead, Mr. Cromwell.
We should press ahead.
Father, what has happened here?
It seems to me that they are
treating you worse than before.
Well, they've taken my stove,
some clothing.
My food is reduced.
- Father how can you...
- Margaret...
you must not be concerned about me.
I've thought long and hard
about Christ's passion and pain and...
I am not afraid of death.
I am only afraid of torture.
If they use violent ways
to make me swear,
I don't know how brave I would be.
But you do not have to suffer anything.
Just take the oath...
like I did.
Like everyone has done.
Just say it and
your body will be saved.
But the saving of my body,
will be at the expense of my soul.
- No!
- Yes.
No. None of us believes that.
Father, please.
Please...
For the love I know you bear us,
don't do this to us.
Mr. Secretary...
Sir Richard Rich.
Sir Richard...
I'm very pleased to see you.
I have a job for you.
Why?
Why can he not be as others?
Why does he have to cross me?
Why can his vanity
be greater than a King's?
It troubles me.
It ways on my conscience
and my heart is full and heavy and sore.
I say this only to you.
I confess only to you.
I love him.
And I hate him.
I hate in equal measure to my love,
for he is the spirit that denies.
It is up to you to judge,
whether or not he be on my conscience!
Sir Richard.
Good day to you.
I see my cell is fast becoming
the place for lawyers to meet.
I am afraid, Thomas,
that I come here most unwillingly
for I am ordered
to deprive you of all your
books and papers... and suchlike.
That is a pity.
Still, if you are ordered to, I suppose,
then I suppose there is no other way.
You had best get started.
May I ask you a question, Thomas?
Only if it's a hypothetical one,
Richard.
It's better that way.
Suppose, then, that...
Parliament enacted a bill
to say that I, Richard Rich, was King,
and that it would be
treason to deny it...
would you accept me as King?
Yes.
But let me counter with
another hypothetical case.
Suppose Parliament enacted that
God was not God,
and to oppose the act would be treason,
would you say that God was not God?
No. Since no Parliament
can make any such law.
It has no competence to decide
on the existence of God.
And no more can Parliament make the King
Supreme Head of the Church.
There, Thomas.
I think my work here is done.
Your Majesty,
the King is here.
My Lady.
Come here.
Do you still have a passion for me?
I do, sweetheart.
I love you.
There now.
Don't weep.
Don't weep, my own darling.
It's all right.
Everything is going to be all right.
Sir Thomas More, you are arraigned
before this commission
on charges of high treason.
How do you answer the charges?
Let me begin by denying
that I ever maliciously opposed
the King's marriage to Anne Boleyn.
I have never spoken
maliciously against it...
but only sometimes according to my
mind,
opinion and my conscience.
And have suffered as a result.
But you have maliciously denied
the Act of Supremacy.
No. I have been silent upon it.
And for all my taciturnity neither
your law nor any law in the world
is able, justly and rightly,
to condemn me,
unless you may also lay to my charge
either some
word or some deed.
Your silence can easily
be construed as an action.
But even in that case,
the presumption
that silence gives consent
precludes the charge against me.
"Qui tacet, consentire videtur."
What of the charge that you conspired
in prison with Bishop Fisher,
a convicted traitor?
I never met him in prison.
I only talked a little with his servant
about familiar things
and recommendations,
such as were seemly
to our long acquaintance.
We go back to your supposed
silence on the Act of Supremacy.
We think you have in fact
spoken about it.
And we have a witness.
Call the solicitor general.
<i>Call, Mr. Richard Rich!</i>
Richard, you are under oath.
Do you tell this commission, truthfully,
what the accused
said to you on this matter.
Yes, Sirs.
We agreed
that Parliement might not make
any such law that God was not God
To which Sir Thomas said:
"No more can Parliament make the King
Supreme Head of the Church."
So he maliciously denied
the King's authority?
In those words?
Yes, Sir.
In those exact words.
Then I will charge this commission
to return a true verdict.
I ask you, good Sirs,
to determine whether
Sir Thomas More did converse
with Sir Richard Rich
in the manner alleged?
You do so find him guilty?
Then I will proceed in judgement
against the prisoner.
My Lord,
when I was a lawyer,
the convention was to ask
the prisoner before judgement was given,
why judgement should not
be given against him.
What then are you able
to say to the contrary?
Thank you.
To my view,
this indictment is
grounded upon an act of Parliament
directly repugnant to the laws of God
and His Holy Church.
The supreme governance of which
no temporal Prince may presume
by any law to take unto himself.
It belongs... It belongs
by right to the See of Rome,
to St Peter and his successors...
as our Saviour told us Himself
when He was on earth.
This realm,
being but one small part of the Church,
cannot make any particular law
disagreeable to the general laws
of Christ's universal Catholic Church.
No more...
No more can this realm of England
refuse obedience to Rome
than can a child refuse obedience
to his own natural father!
We now plainly see
that you are maliciously bent.
No, Sirs. Not maliciously.
I hope we may all meet
merrily in heaven hereafter.
And I desire Almighty God
to preserve and defend
the King's Majesty,
and to send him
good counsel.
Sir Thomas More,
you are to be drawn on a hurdle
through the City of London to Tyburn,
there to be hanged
till you be half dead,
after that
cut down alive,
your bowels to be taken out of your body
and burned before you,
your privy parts cut off,
your head cut off,
your body to be divided
in four parts...
Bless us, father.
I bless you, my children.
Be of good cheer,
for I pray that
we will meet together in heaven!
When is the execution?
Tomorrow, Your Majesty.
What date is that?
The 6th of July.
What time?
At ten in the morning.
I have decided to commute
the sentence to beheading.
Tell the officials.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Pietate tua, quaessumus Domine,
nostrorum solve vincula peccatorum,
et intercedente
beata Maria semper virgine.
Nos famulos tuos
in omni sanctitate custodi.
Per Christum
Dominum nostrum.
Thank you, Sir Humphrey.
But when I come down again,
let me shift for myself,
as well as I can.
I ask you to bear witness with me
that I shall now suffer death in
and for the faith
of the Holy Catholic Church.
I beg you earnestly
to pray for the King,
and tell him
I died his good servant
but God's first.
I ask for your pardon and blessing.
You will give me this day
a greater benefit than any mortal man
can ever be able to give me.
Pluck up your spirits, man,
and be not afraid to do your office.
Miserere miti Domime,
secundum miseration un tuum.

<i>Précédemment...</i>
Maintenant que la Reine et moi
avons un enfant,
la succession se limitera
à notre seule descendance.
Je vous réconcilierais avec votre père,
si vous m'acceptez comme Reine.
Je ne reconnais comme Reine que ma mère.
J'accorderai à la Princesse
sa propre résidence.
- Lady Mary la servira.
- La fille de Catherine ?
Le serment d'allégeance
a connu un grand succès
de même que votre mariage.
Mais nous n'avons pu convaincre
Fisher ou Thomas More
de prêter serment.
Il ne peut y avoir de compromis.
C'est tout ou rien.
Pourquoi ne prêtez-vous pas serment ?
En toute honnêteté, vous risquez
d'en payer le prix ultime.
Votre sœur est une très belle femme.
Mais pas autant que son frère.
Il peut faire tout ce qu'il désire.
Il a un pouvoir absolu.
Ce qu'il vous donne,
il peut le reprendre !
Et ce qu'il a repris,
il peut le redonner !
Si vous réussissez à tuer cette catin,
vous serez aimé de Dieu.
- Je peux encore le faire.
- N'agissez pas seul, Brearton.
- Qu'avez-vous fait pour tuer l'enfant ?
- Rien.
J'ai fait tellement attention.
Nous devrons tous faire attention,
vous en particulier,
à ne pas perdre l'amour du Roi.
Ou tout sera perdu. Pour nous tous.
Pourquoi doit-il me contrarier ?
Son orgueil serait-il
supérieur à celui du Roi ?
Je l'aime...
Et je le hais !
Je vous supplie de prier pour le Roi.
Dites-lui que je suis mort
en bon serviteur,
mais celui de Dieu avant tout.

Que Dieu le Tout-Puissant
vous accorde sa clémence
et pardonne vos péchés,
et que Jésus-Christ
vous guide vers la vie éternelle.
Amen.
À tous les fidèles d'Angleterre,
Votre Saint-Père présente
ses plus sincères condoléances,
ses larmes d'affliction
et sa colère pour la mort en martyr
de Sir Thomas More
et du Cardinal Fisher.
Leur assassinat a bouleversé
toute la chrétienté.
C'était un péché impardonnable
contre Dieu et notre Sainte-Église,
pour lesquels
ces deux grands hommes sont morts.
Nous prions pour ceux qui,
en Angleterre,
continuent à vivre
sous le joug de la tyrannie
et dans la crainte pour leurs vies
et pour leurs âmes.
Nous implorons le Roi
de cesser d'écouter les voix du Mal
et de revenir dans l'obéissance
de la foi véritable
avant qu'il ne soit trop tard.
Nous prions Marie, mère de Dieu,
pour que l'Angleterre soit
délivrée de l'hérésie
et toutes ses pratiques maléfiques,
et des griffes des hérétiques
qui la mèneront inexorablement vers
la destruction et la damnation !
George Boleyn, Lord Rochford,
va épouser la fille de Lord Morley.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Lord Morley est venu me voir.
Il ne peut réunir la dot de 300 livres
que demande Sir Thomas Boleyn.
Je lui ai assuré que je verserai
la somme manquante.
Votre Majesté est très généreuse.
Qu'en est-il de l'inspection
des lieux de cultes ?
Les inspecteurs enquêtent
actuellement dans le West Country.
Là et ailleurs, ils ont découvert
de nombreuses aberrations.
Quelles aberrations ?
Ils ont découvert que les moines,
en de nombreux endroits,
sont si pervers,
immoraux et corrompus
que vos inspecteurs désespèrent
de pouvoir les réformer.
À titre d'exemple,
le Saint Sang de Hailes tant vénéré,
supposé être le sang d'un saint,
utilisé pour soigner les pèlerins
en quête de miracle,
s'avère n'être que du sang de canard
que les moines
renouvellent régulièrement.
Du sang de canard.
Alors, M. Cromwell,
que proposez-vous comme solution ?
Que Votre Majesté me pardonne,
mais je pense que nous devrions trouver
des moyens de promouvoir
votre nouveau règne.
Qu'avez-vous à l'esprit ?
En montant des pièces de théâtre,
par exemple.
Pourquoi donc ?
C'est la meilleure façon d'exposer
au regard du peuple
l'horreur et la cruauté
de l'Évêque de Rome.
Elles visent aussi à montrer au peuple,
l'obéissance qu'en tant que sujets
ils doivent,
de par les lois de Dieu
et des hommes,
à Votre Majesté.
Parfait.
Je vous laisse donc le soin,
M. le Secrétaire,
de financer et mettre en scène
quelques... pièces.
Faisons tout notre possible
pour promouvoir notre révolution.
<i>... que je vais maintenant
subir la mort, dans...</i>
<i>et pour la foi...</i>
<i>de l'Église Catholique.</i>
- Milord.
- M. le Secrétaire,
Votre Grâce.
Puisque votre seigneurie ne cache pas
son zèle pour les réformes,
nous voulions vous tenir au courant
de nos progrès.
Sa Grâce vient de m'informer
d'une importante nomination
à la Cathédrale de Canterbury.
En effet, le Dr Simon Heyes
a été nommé nouveau doyen.
Il a une aversion particulière
pour le culte des icônes.
Il entend les éliminer de la Cathédrale
et introduire le nouvel enseignement.
Il est vital que les réformateurs
occupent des postes de responsabilités
au sein de l'Église.
Il y aura des réactions
à la mort en martyrs
de Fisher et More.
J'ai donc fait savoir dans tout le pays
que quiconque ayant un ami
ou un voisin critiquant le Roi,
son mariage ou les réformes,
se doit de le dénoncer.
De même, M. Cromwell,
nous avons le devoir
d'annoncer la bonne nouvelle.
Cette nouvelle monarchie représente
surtout une libération.
Des vieilles superstitions,
de la crainte et des remords.
Nous transitons
de l'obscurité à la lumière.
Je suis d'accord avec Votre Grâce.
Heureusement,
nous avons une nouvelle arme
pour promouvoir nos idées.
Mon Dieu !
Qu'est-ce donc ?
Ceci est une presse à imprimer, Milord.
Et elle va changer le monde.
À quoi pensez-vous ?
À rien.
Puis-je dire une chose ?
De nombreuses personnes
hors de nos frontières,
et peut-être même dans ce royaume,
mettent encore en doute
la légitimité de notre fille.
C'est vrai.
Vous savez que c'est vrai.
Mais nous pouvons y remédier.
Si Elizabeth était promise
au fils du Roi François,
le Duc d'Angoulême,
sa légitimité et son rang
ne seraient plus remis en cause.
Je suis d'accord,
et j'y ai déjà pensé.
J'en parlerai
à l'Ambassadeur de France.
Me rejoindrez-vous ce soir ?
<i>Cher Thomas !</i>
<i>- Majesté.
- Restez à la cour, j'ai besoin de vous.</i>
<i>Je ne signerai pas.</i>
<i>Le monde saura
que le Roi d'Angleterre est capricieux !</i>
<i>- Un Roi doit-il être craint...
- Je refuse d'être Chancelier.</i>
<i>Ou aimé ?
Vous exécuterez mes ordres !</i>
<i>- Je viens présenter ma démission.
- Le temps de Harry est révolu !</i>
<i>Je vous libère... de bonne grâce.</i>
<i>Votre tête sera tranchée.</i>
<i>Votre corps sera divisé
en quatre parties.</i>
<i>Pardonnez-moi.</i>
Thomas ?
Thomas...
Qu'y a-t-il ?
J'ai changé d'avis.
Je ne veux pas l'épouser.
Non, chérie.
Toutes les femmes ont un moment...
... d'hésitation. C'est compréhensible.
Non !
Vous allez vous unir
à une grande famille.
Et je vous somme de le faire.
Comprenez-vous ?
Benedicto Dei
omnipotentis.
Patris et Filii
et Spiritus sancti...
Finissons-en !
Amen !
Mes frères,
nous sommes réunis en ces lieux...
Majesté, Sir Henry Norris.
Sir Henry.
- Votre Majesté.
- Que puis-je pour vous ?
Votre Majesté n'est pas sans ignorer
que je suis récemment devenu veuf.
Et je cherche à prendre femme à nouveau.
Mon choix s'est porté sur
une des dames de compagnie de la Reine.
Qui donc ?
Lady Margaret Sheldon.
Vous voulez dire Madge.
Je sais que certains proches
la prénomment ainsi.
Avez-vous exposé vos intentions
à Mlle Sheldon, Sir Henry ?
Non, Votre Majesté. Je l'ai...
simplement admirée de loin.
Mais j'aspire à faire
avancer les choses.
Si Votre Majesté n'y voit pas...
d'inconvénients.
Non. Aucun.
Vous avez ma permission.
Je vous connais depuis longtemps.
Je ne pouvais espérer
plus honorable mari pour elle.
Je suis reconnaissant à Votre Majesté.
- Sir Henry.
- Votre Majesté.
Son Excellence, l'Ambassadeur de France.
- Excellence.
- Votre Majesté a demandé à me voir ?
Je voulais des nouvelles
de mon frère, le Roi.
Sa Majesté se porte très bien.
Exception faite
de sa haine pour l'Empereur,
- qui le ronge comme une maladie.
- Veut-il toujours de notre amitié ?
Il vous aime plus que
tout autre prince au monde.
Alors, faites-lui
la proposition suivante :
Que son fils Charles, Duc d'Angoulême,
soit fiancé à notre fille bien-aimée,
Elizabeth.
Qui est-elle ?
Jane Parker.
La fille de Lord Morley.
Un lointain cousin du Roi.
Mais c'est une femme.
Qu'y a-t-il d'amusant ?
Je ne sais pas.
Chérie.
Vous m'aimez, n'est-ce pas, Georges ?
Bien sûr que oui.
Ne vous ai-je pas épousée ?
Je suis impatient d'être à ce soir.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Rien. Je...
Excusez-moi, Père.
Vous êtes très jolie.
La jolie Jane.
Non, s'il vous plaît.
Je vous en prie.
Poursuivons par nos autres sujets.
Dès lors que le Roi Jean
se conduit de la sorte
avec notre Sainte Église,
je le maudis donc...
de la croix, du livre,
de la cloche et des cierges.
Je demanderai à Dieu
de le priver de sa lumière éternelle.
Je le soustrairai au Christ.
Et après que la cloche ait sonné...
La cloche, idiot !
La cloche !
Et après que la cloche ait sonné...
J'ai dit, "après"
que la cloche ait sonné.
Corps et âme,
je le jetterai
dans les flammes de l'enfer !
Pendant ce temps...
Beau travail, M. le Secrétaire.
Très éducatif.
Je me demande qui l'a écrite ?
M. Bale.
C'était un prêtre de l'ancien culte,
mais voyant le cours des évènements,
il est devenu un ardent réformateur.
Je pense que notre famille
n'a jamais rien fait de mieux
que de faciliter et d'encourager
votre ascension.
Je suis persuadé
que vous ne l'oublierez jamais.
Les prêtres et les évêques auront...
beaucoup... beaucoup d'argent !
J'aime le Pape autant que possible.
Dites-moi pourquoi, je vous prie ?
Car ma perception est claire.
Le Pape est un agréable monsieur,
un élégant monsieur,
un riche monsieur.
Oui, et un joyeux monsieur.
Il est riche de par son rang...
et angélique dans son apparence !
J'ai parlé à l'Ambassadeur de France.
François va envoyer l'Amiral de France
pour conclure le mariage.
Merci.
Majestés.
L'Amiral de France
vient en visite officielle.
Je veux que vous le receviez
et que vous le divertissiez.
Pourquoi lui ?
Mon père aurait été
un choix plus approprié.
Je sais que Votre Grâce
exécutera mes ordres.
Je demeure...
le serviteur humble et dévoué
de Votre Majesté.
C'était inutile.
- Il me hait.
- Mais il m'aime.
Comme ils sont en latin...
personne ne peut le savoir.
- Que voulait-il ?
- Cette femme est une catin !
Elle me traite pire
que je ne traite mes chiens.
Mais en retour, vos chiens mordent.
Si nous renonçons aux cérémonies
et aux superstitions,
alors adieu, moines, prieurs,
prêtres, frères, évêques...
et tout ce beau monde !
Comment va la Reine Catherine ?
Hélas, elle ne va pas très bien.
Elle sombre.
Non seulement sa rente a été réduite,
mais elle n'a pas vu sa fille
depuis 4 ans.
- C'est vraiment cruel.
- Mais sa foi est stupéfiante.
Et Lady Mary ?
Tant que la concubine est au pouvoir,
je crains pour sa vie.
Pour le bien de cette nation.
Precibus et meritis beatae
Maria simper Virginis...
Lady Mary. Que faites-vous
avec la Princesse Elizabeth ?
Elle était seule.
Je prenais soin d'elle.
Donnez-la-moi.
Vous l'avez laissée seule.
Pauvre sotte !
Buvons pour ceux
qui ne sont plus parmi nous.
À More et Fisher,
ces hommes morts en martyrs.
Que Dieu les bénisse.
On m'a rapporté que nombre de ceux
qui soutenaient les réformes du Roi
ont, à présent, une opinion différente.
Le meurtre d'hommes honnêtes et fidèles
leur a ouvert les yeux.
Je n'en veux toujours pas au Roi.
Il a été séduit par sorcellerie.
Je l'ai toujours su,
et maintenant, j'en ai la preuve.
Vous avez une preuve ?
Je me suis lié d'amitié
avec une des dames de chambre d'Anne,
qui m'a dit que cette catin
cache un secret.
Elle a une difformité, Chapuys.
Un doigt supplémentaire
à la main gauche,
qu'elle a beaucoup de mal à camoufler.
De plus, son corps
est couvert de verrues,
parfois appelées,
les mamelons du Diable.
Cette domestique m'a juré
qu'elle en a vu très clairement
sur la peau d'Anne,
même si elle cherche
constamment à se couvrir.
Grand Dieu !
- En êtes-vous sûr ?
- C'est la vérité.
Voilà pourquoi elle doit mourir.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Il a de plus en plus de liaisons.
En êtes-vous sûre ?
Bien sûr que je le suis.
Souvent, il disparaît,
et nul n'ose me dire où il est.
Je sais qu'il quitte le palais.
Et il reste parfois absent
pendant des heures.
Il doit avoir un harem quelque part.
Un endroit secret
où il garde son harem.
Où il garde ses femmes.
J'en suis persuadée.
Quelque chose va m'arriver.
Vous savez qu'il y a une prophétie.
Tout le monde la connaît.
Elle dit...
qu'une Reine d'Angleterre sera brûlée.
Ne dites pas cela.
Il ne vous arrivera rien.
Je suis incapable
de donner un fils au Roi.
Un fils...
qui serait à l'image de son père.
Ne vous inquiétez pas. Tout ira bien.
Je vous en prie, ne pleurez pas.
Je vous aime.
Je promets de prendre soin de vous.
Ne pleurez pas.
- Sir Thomas.
- M. le Secrétaire.
Qu'est-ce donc cela ?
Des dénonciations.
Il est dit qu'un prêtre à Tewksbury,
inconsciemment ou pas,
a offert ses prières
à la Reine Catherine
au lieu d'Anne.
Sept personnes de sa congrégation
ont reporté ces faits.
Qu'allez-vous lui faire ?
Rien du tout.
Il avoisine les 80 ans.
Un malencontreux lapsus
d'un aussi vieil homme
est parfaitement pardonnable.
Par contre, certaines de celles-ci...
sont beaucoup plus préoccupantes.
Regardez cela.
Des tracts faisant
l'éloge de Sa Majesté,
de sa nouvelle monarchie
et de la réforme. Ils expliquent...
pourquoi ces réformes sont nécessaires
et les libertés et les opportunités
qu'elles apportent aux sujets
de Sa Majesté.
Très impressionnant.
Félicitations pour votre entreprise,
M. le Secrétaire.
Mais cela ne vous inquiète pas
que le Roi ait acquis
le pouvoir absolu,
sans aucune entrave
pour refaire la loi ?
N'est-ce pas cela qui plaît au Roi...
... la loi ?
Ce n'était...
- qu'une simple remarque.
- Je vous estime, M. Wyatt,
et j'apprécie votre compagnie, mais...
vous avez mauvaise réputation.
Vous jouez...
et fréquentez les catins.
Vous naviguez près du vent.
Espérons que cela ne vous mène pas
droit aux rochers.
Son Excellence Philippe Chabot de Brion,
Amiral de France.
- Votre Grâce.
- Amiral Chabot.
J'ai l'honneur de vous accueillir,
vous et vos gens
chez moi et en Angleterre.
Je vous présente ma femme, la Duchesse.
Avec votre permission,
je vous présente mon secrétaire,
M. Alphonse Gontier.
Votre Grâce.
Et ma nièce, Mademoiselle Germaine.
Mademoiselle, vous êtes très belle.
Madame.
Votre Grâce.
Dites-moi, Votre Grâce,
à quoi devons-nous nous attendre ?
Nous vous divertirons ici
quelques jours,
- puis le Roi vous invitera à dîner.
- Très bien.
Il y a autre chose...
On m'a dit que la Reine Anne
a prévu un banquet en votre honneur
et un match de jeu de paume.
Vous aviez rencontré la Reine à Calais,
quand elle a accompagné Sa Majesté
avant son couronnement.
Cela est possible,
mais je n'en ai aucun souvenir.
Et malheureusement,
je ne joue pas au jeu de paume.
Je vous en prie.
Bonjour, John.
Votre Majesté.
- Où allez-vous ?
- Je sors.
- Où cela ?
- Rentrez donc !
Je veux savoir où vous allez.
Cela ne vous regarde pas.
Rentrez sur le champ !
Majesté.
Mademoiselle.
<i>J'apprécie votre Excellence.</i>
Vous êtes très perspicace.
Mais je n'apprécie pas la façon
dont votre Empereur me traite.
Il croit qu'au sujet de Catherine,
j'ai agi par cruauté,
ou que j'ai été... mal intentionné.
Mais je jure qu'il n'en est rien.
Je devrais me satisfaire
de la connaissance qu'a le monde
des nombreux torts qui m'ont été faits.
Vous n'approuvez pas les changements
que je fais dans ce royaume.
Cromwell a intercepté
certaines de vos lettres.
Nous appelions cela "l'humanisme".
Wolsey, More et moi...
étions tous des humanistes.
Beaucoup croient
que j'ai changé, mais c'est faux.
Je reste un humaniste, au fond de moi.
Chapuys,
je vous promets
d'instaurer de telles réformes
dans ce royaume
que l'on se souviendra
de moi à jamais
à travers toute la chrétienté.
Je ne doute pas le moins du monde
que le règne de Sa Majesté
restera à jamais
gravé dans les mémoires.
J'avais organisé un banquet
en son honneur.
- Pour qui ?
- L'Amiral français.
Cela fait déjà 2 semaines
qu'il est chez le Duc de Suffolk,
et je n'ai reçu
aucun message de sympathie.
Tous les diplomates français
qui l'ont précédé m'en ont envoyé.
Il n'a pas non plus
requis d'audience avec moi.
Avec moi, la Reine d'Angleterre.
Alors que nous allons évoquer
l'avenir de mon enfant.
Votre Majesté devrait se reposer.
Je devrais vous laisser.
On m'a dit qu'il a lié connaissance
avec l'Ambassadeur impérial, Chapuys.
N'est-ce pas incroyable ? Dites-moi ?
Pourquoi ferait-il une telle chose ?
Pourquoi ne dites-vous rien, Mark ?
Que Sa Majesté me pardonne,
je ne sais quoi dire.
Cela va bien au-delà
de mes compétences.
Je ne suis qu'un maître de danse.
Il y a autre chose...
Une personne qui sans nul doute me hait
m'a dit que le Roi a sciemment invité
nombre de belles femmes à la cour
pour la visite de l'Amiral.
Pouvez-vous y croire ?
Votre Grâce.
Votre Majesté.
Puis-je vous présenter son Excellence,
Philippe Chabot de Brion,
Amiral de France.
Majesté.
Bienvenue à ma cour.
Laissez-moi vous présenter ma femme.
La Reine Anne.
Je vous en prie, asseyons-nous.
- Un peu de vin ?
- Avec plaisir.
De quel domaine vient-il ?
De Bordeaux ?
- C'est du vin anglais.
- Du vin anglais ?
L'Angleterre fait son vin
depuis l'époque des Romains.
Est-ce si récent que ça ?
Il est très fruité.
Et fort, comme...
de la sueur de gladiateur.
Qui est ce monsieur ?
Mon secrétaire, Monsieur Gontier.
J'aimerais le présenter à ma femme.
Veuillez m'excuser.
Enchanté, Mademoiselle.
Majesté ?
Que Sa Majesté me pardonne
de n'avoir pu assister
au banquet donné en mon honneur.
C'était fort malheureux,
mais sa Grâce, le Duc de Suffolk
et sa charmante épouse
m'ont, pour ainsi dire,
retenu prisonnier dans leur château.
J'ai été...
Comment dire ?
... Emprisonné par affection.
Madame,
riez-vous à mes dépens ?
Veuillez m'excuser, Monsieur.
Je ne peux m'empêcher de rire
à la proposition du Roi
de me présenter à votre secrétaire.
Alors qu'il allait le chercher,
il s'est arrêté à cette belle dame,
et en a tout oublié.
Parlons un peu affaires.
Quelles directives
avez-vous de votre maître
quant aux fiançailles de ma fille
Elizabeth au Duc d'Angoulême ?
Sa Majesté regrette
que cela soit impossible.
Pourquoi serait-ce "impossible" ?
Malgré tout son amour pour vous,
il ne peut consentir
à fiancer son fils bien-aimé à une...
promise dont la légitimité
n'est pas reconnue
par Sa Sainteté le Pape Paul,
ni par la Sainte Église,
ni même par l'Empereur.
Cependant, Sa Majesté,
pour vous prouver son amour,
vous fait une autre proposition.
Il consentirait à fiancer le Dauphin...
à Lady Mary,
votre fille légitime.
Si vous refusez cette union,
mon maître mariera son fils
à la fille de l'Empereur.
Ce qui vous isolera
des autres pays d'Europe.
Excellence, votre audience
avec Sa Majesté est terminée.
Je suis désolé.
Je n'ai aucune excuse, Catherine.
Je croyais ce passé révolu.
La nature humaine
ne change peut-être jamais.
Je vous jure que
cela ne se reproduira plus.
Je vous aime beaucoup trop.
Je ne peux vous demander de me croire.
Mais c'est la vérité.
Vous voyez...
Vous m'avez finalement fait pleurer.
Qui était-ce ?
Qui donc ?
La dame avec laquelle vous parliez
alors que vous deviez voir M. Gontier.
Je l'ignore.
C'est une de vos maîtresses ?
Combien en avez-vous ?
Comment se nomment-elles ?
Où les cachez-vous ?
On m'a dit que des nobles, tel Brandon,
vous assistent dans vos infidélités.
C'en est assez !
Vous m'avez toujours dit
que nous devions être honnêtes
l'un envers l'autre.
Que c'était la définition de l'amour.
Alors, voici la vérité :
Vous devrez fermer les yeux et subir !
Comme vos aînées
l'ont fait avant vous.
Comment osez-vous me dire cela ?
Ignorez-vous donc que je vous aime
mille fois plus que Catherine !
Et ignorez-vous
que je peux causer votre perte
aussi vite que je vous ai hissée ?
Soyez heureuse d'avoir une couche,
Madame,
car si vous ne l'aviez pas déjà,
je doute que je vous la donne.
François a refusé les fiançailles.
- Pourquoi ?
- À votre avis ?
Parce que le Pape,
lui-même et l'Empereur
s'accordent tous à dire
que c'est une bâtarde !
Et que vous n'êtes pas ma femme !
Dites-moi, comment va votre Catherine ?
Elle va bien.
À dire vrai, elle est enceinte.
Vous avez fait
un heureux mariage, Charles.
Je vous envie.
Pensez-vous que les planètes
influencent nos vies ?
Je l'ignore.
J'en débattais souvent avec More.
Nous passions des nuits sur le toit,
à étudier le ciel.
More avait une immense
connaissance des étoiles
et de leur manière d'influencer...
nos humeurs.
Je regrette ce qui lui est arrivé.
J'aurais voulu que cela ne soit pas.
Mais la faute n'incombe pas qu'à moi.
Dès que ma détermination faiblissait,
et que j'étais enclin à le sauver,
une certaine personne, en privé,
me poussait à le détruire.
Qui donc ?
Vous savez qui elle est, Charles.

Previously on The Tudors...
Now that the Queen and I have
a child, with others to follow,
the line of succession is now
firmly vested in our children.
I would reconcile you with your father
if you would only accept me as Queen.
I recognize no Queen but my mother.
The Princess will shortly
be given her own establishment.
The Lady Mary will attend and
wait on her. Katherine's daughter?
Yes.
We have had a great success
in the swearing of allegiance
in favour of your marriage to
Queen Anne, but we cannot persuade
either Fisher or Thomas
More to swear the oath.
There can be no compromise.
In this matter, it is all or nothing.
Why will you not take
the oath? In all honesty,
you are likely to pay the ultimate price.
Your sister is a very beautiful
young woman. Not as beautiful as her brother.
He can do whatever he wills now.
He has absolute power.
And what he has given, he can take away!
And what taken away, he can give back!
If you succeed in killing the King's
whore, you would be the beloved of God.
- I could still do it.
- Don't be stupid, Brereton. And don't act alone.
- What did you do to kill the baby?
- I didn't.
Believe me, I was so careful.
From now on, we must all be careful,
you especially, not to
lose the King's love,
or everything is lost for all of us.
Why does he have to cross me?
Why can his vanity be greater than a King's?
I love him, and I hate him!
I beg you earnestly
to pray for the King.
Tell him I died his
good servant, but God's first.
AHH!!
Amen.
To the faithful people of England,
your Holy Father offers you
the hand of condolence,
his tears of grief
and his anger at the martyrdom
of Sir Thomas More and Cardinal Fisher.
Their murder has shocked
the whole of Christendom.
It was an unpardonable sin against
God and our Holy Church, in whose name
these two great and noble men died.
We pray for those in England
who must continue
to live under tyranny
and in fear for their lives
and for their souls.
We pray the King
ceases to listen to evil counsel
and returns to obedience
and the true faith,
before it is too late.
We pray to Mary, Mother of God,
that England may be
redeemed from heresy,
and all its evil ways,
and from the clutches of the heretics
who even now, are leading her towards
destruction and damnation!
George Boleyn, Lord Rochford,
is to marry Lord Morley's daughter.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Lord Morley came to see me.
He cannot meet Sir Thomas Boleyn's
demand for a dowry of 300 pounds.
I assured him that I would
make up the shortfall.
Your Majesty is most generous.
How is your survey of the
religious houses progressing?
Majesty, the Commissioners are currently
examining houses in the west country.
There, and elsewhere, they tell me
they have uncovered many enormities.
What enormities?
They have found
the monks and many places
so depraved, so licentious
and so corrupt that your commissioners
already despair of
any perfect reformation.
For example the case of the
celebrated Hy Blood of Hailes.
Supposedly the blood of a saint,
used for healing the pilgrims who
flock there hoping for a miracle,
it turns out to be
the blood of a duck,
which the monks renew regularly.
Duck's blood...
Well, Mr. Cromwell,
what do you propose we do about it?
If Your Majesty will forgive me,
I think we should be looking for ways
to promote your Majesty's New Monarchy.
What do you have in mind?
One way would be through
the production of plays.
- Why plays?
- Plays are
an ideal way of setting forth,
before the people's eyes,
the abomination and wickedness
of the Bishop of Rome.
They're also a means
to demonstrate to people
the obedience that
as subjects they owe,
by God's and man's laws,
to Your Majesty. Good.
Then, I leave it to you, Mr. Secretary,
to finance and produce some plays.
We must do all we can
to advance our revolution.
<i>...that I shall
now suffer death in</i>
<i>and for the faith</i>
<i>of the Holy Catholic Church.</i>
- My Lord.
- Mr. Secretary. Your Grace.
Since Your Lordship makes no
secret of your zeal for reform,
we were anxious to let
you know our progress.
His Grace has just informed me
of an important new appointment
at Canterbury Cathedral.
Indeed. Dr. Simon Heyes has
been made our new Dean.
Dr Heyes particularly detests
the cult and images
and is determined to removed
them from the Cathedral
as well as introducing the new learning.
It's vital that we place reformers
in positions of responsibility
inside the Church.
There's bound to be a reaction to the
self-serving martyrdoms of Fisher and More.
Which is why I'm letting it
be known, throughout the Kingdom,
that if anyone hears
a friend or a neighbor,
criticizing the King or his
marriage or the reforms,
they have a duty to report it.
At the same time, Mr. Cromwell
we have a duty to
spread the good news.
If the New Monarchy
is about anything at all
then it is about liberty!
Liberty from old superstitions
from fear and guilt.
We... we are moving, my friends,
from darkness into light.
I'm in agreement with Your Grace.
Fortunately, we have a new weapon
to promote our ideas.
Oh, my Lord! What
in God's name is that?
It's called a
printing press, my lord.
And it will change the world.
What are you thinking of?
Nothing.
May I say something?
You know there are
many people abroad,
and perhaps even some
within this Kingdom,
who still question the
legitimacy of our daughter.
It's true.
You know it's true.
But there is something we can
do to change everything.
If Elizabeth was betrothed
to King Francis's youngest son,
the Duke of Angouleme,
then her legitimacy and
station would no longer
be questioned by anyone.
I agree,
and have already thought about it.
I will speak to the French Ambassador.
Will you come to my bed tonight?
<i>Dear Thomas!</i>
- Majesty.
- Come and stay at court.
I need you. I'm not going to
sign it! Go and tell them!
People are going to know that the
King of England is easily changeable!
- Is it better for a King to be feared?
- I don't want to be chancellor.
Or loved? You will do as I command!
- Harry. Harry. I come to offer my resignation.
- The time for Harry is over!
I discharge you most willingly.
Your head, cut off. Your body,
to be divided in four parts.
Please forgive me.
Hey.
Thomas?
Thomas...
What is it?
I've changed my mind.
I don't want to go through with it.
Now, now, sweetheart.
Every woman has a moment
of faintheartedness.
It's natural.
No!
You are marrying into a great family.
You will do it, whether you like
it or not. Do you understand?
Benedicto Dei
omnipotentis:
Patris et Filii
et Spiritus sancti...
Get on with it!
Amen!
Brethren, we are gathered here today.
Majesty, Sir Henry Norris.
Sir Henry.
- Your Majesty.
- What can I do for you?
Well as Your Majesty may know,
I recently became a widower.
And so, naturally,
I am looking to wed again.
And my choice has fallen
upon one of Her Majesty's ladies.
- Who?
- Lady Margaret Sheldon.
- You mean Madge!
- Yes.
Yes, I believe some
people call her that.
If they are familiar with her.
Have you made your intentions plain
to Miss Sheldon, Sir Henry?
No, Your Majesty. I have merely
admired her from a distance.
But I would now like
to take things further.
If Your Majesty can think of no...
impediment?
No. None.
You have my permission.
I have known you a long time.
I could not think of a more honest
nor a more honorable man.
I am deeply grateful to Your Majesty.
Sir Henry.
Your Majesty.
His Excellency the French Ambassador.
- Excellency.
- Your Majesty wanted to see me?
I wanted to ask
after my brother, the King.
His Majesty is very well.
Except for his hatred of the Emperor,
which is like a disease.
So he still wants our friendship?
Mon Dieu! He loves you above
all the princes in the world.
Then make to him this proposal
that his son Charles,
Duke of Angouleme,
should be betrothed to
our beloved daughter,
Elizabeth.
Who is she?
Jane Parker.
Lord Morley's daughter. He's a
distant cousin of the King...
But she's a girl.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Was that funny?
I don't know.
Sweetheart.
You do love me, don't you, George?
Of course I love you.
I married you, didn't I?
Oh, I can't wait for tonight.
- What is it?
- Nothing. I...
Excuse me, father.
You're very pretty,
... Pretty Jane.
No.
No, please...
No, please.
Please don't...
Let us go about our other matters.
Now as much as King John
does Holy Church so handle,
so here I curse him with cross,
book, bell and candle...
I will ask God
to put him from His eternal light.
I will take him from Christ,
and after the sound of this bell...
The bell, you buggers!
The bell!
And after the sound of this bell.
I said after the sound of this bell...
Both body and soul,
I will give him to the devil in hell!
And meanwhile... This is a fine
piece of work, Mr. Secretary.
And educative.
I wonder who wrote it?
Ah, Mr. Bale.
He was once a priest of the old faith,
but seeing how things went on,
became a most passionate reformer.
You know, I think our family
never did anything better
than facilitate and encourage
your own rise, Mr. Secretary.
And I trust you never
forget that we did so.
... and Bishops,
will make lots and lots of money.
I love the Pope,
as much as I ever may be.
I pray thee heartily,
tell me why you do so?
Because I perceive well,
the Pope is a jolly fellow
A trim fellow, a rich fellow.
Yes, and a merry fellow!
He's rich in his royalty...
and angelic to his behold!
I've talked to the French Ambassador.
Francis is sending the Admiral of
France to arrange the marriage.
Thank you.
Majesties.
The Admiral of France is
to pay an official visit.
I want you to receive
and entertain him on my behalf.
Why him?
Surely my father would be
a much better choice.
I trust Your Grace
to carry out my commands.
I am, as ever,
Your Majesty's humble
and obedient servant.
That was unnecessary.
- He hates me.
- But he loves me.
As they're in latin...
no man can know.
What is it?
That woman is a whore!
She treats me worse
than I treat my dogs.
But then your dogs biteack!
If ceremonies and
superstitions from us fall,
then farewell monks and canons,
priest, friar, bishop...
and ALL.
How is Queen Katherine?
Alas she is very unwell.
She is sinking.
Not only is her
household severely reduced,
but she has been separated
from her daughter
for the last 4 years.
That is very cruel.
But her faith is astonishing.
And the Lady Mary?
While the concubine has power,
I fear for her life.
To the comfort of this nation!
Precibus et meritis beatae
Maria simper Virginis...
Lady Mary. What in heaven's
name are you doing
with the Princess Elizabeth?
She was left alone.
I took care of her.
Give her to me.
You left her alone.
You little fool!
We sup and think of those
who are no longer with us:
to More and to Fisher,
those martyred men.
God bless them.
I am told that many who
initially supported the King's reforms
are now forming a different opinion.
The terrible murders
of honest and faithful men
has opened many eyes.
I still do not blame the King.
He has been seduced by witchcraft.
I've always believed it,
and now I have proof.
- You have proof? - Yes.
I have befriended
a maid of Anne's bedchamber,
who has told me that
the harlot hides a secret.
She's deformed Chapuys,
an extra fingernail on her left hand,
which she is always
at great pains to conceal.
As well her body
is covered in moles, which is
sometimes called, the Devil's Teats
as you know. Now, this maid,
she swore to me honestly that
she had seen these quite plainly
on Anne's naked skin,
even though the lady constantly
seeks to cover herself.
My God!
Is it so?
It's is truth.
That is why she must die.
What is it?
He's having more affairs.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.
Often I can't find him. No one
will tell me where he is.
He leaves the palace. I know that.
He's gone for hours sometimes.
I think he's got a harem somewhere.
There's a place where
he keeps his harem,
where he keeps his women. I know it.
Anne.
Something's going to happen to me.
- No!
- You know there's a prophecy.
Everyone knows it. The prophecy says
a Queen of England will be burned.
- Don't talk like this.
Nothing is going to happen to you.
I'm unable to give a King a son;
a son
to be the living image of his father.
Shhh...
It's all right. Everything
is going to be all right.
Please don't cry.
I love you.
I'll look after you, I swear.
Please don't cry.
Sir Thomas.
Mr. Secretary. What are all these?
Denunciations.
It is reported that a canon at Tewksbury,
mistakenly or otherwise, offered
prayers to Katherine the Queen.
Other than Anne.
Seven of his congregation
reported these words.
- What will you do to him?
- Nothing.
He's near 80 years old.
An absent-minded slip of the tongue
in such an old man
is perfectly forgivable.
Some of these others
are much more serious.
Look at these.
The tracts praising His Majesty
and his New Monarchy and
the reformation they explain.
Why the reformation is necessary
and the liberties and the opportunities
it would be bringing to the King's
humblest subjects.
It's very impressive.
You are to be congratulated on
your industry, Mr. Secretary.
But does it never concern you
that the King has taken to himself
an absolute power,
without any constraint,
to remake the law?
Is not that which pleases
the King... the law?
I was... I was only observing...
I like you, Mr. Wyatt,
and enjoy your company.
But you have a reputation:
you gamble and you whore.
You sail close to the wind.
God forbid
it should ever blow you onto the rocks.
His Excellency Philippe
Chabot de Brion,
Admiral of France.
- Your Grace.
- Admiral Chabot.
It is my privilege and pleasure
to welcome you and your party
to my home and to England.
May I present my wife,
the Duchess.
Madame. Je suis ravi
de vous connaître.
And, with your permission,
may I present my Secretary,
Monsieur Alfonse Gontier...
Madame. Your Grace.
And my niece,
Mademoiselle Germaine.
Mademoiselle. You are very pretty.
Madame. Your Grace.
So tell me, your Grace,
what are we to expect?
I am to entertain you and
your staff here for a few days.
Then the King invites
you to dine at court.
- Very good.
- There is one other thing:
I am told that Queen Anne
has planned a banquet in your honor.
And a tennis match.
I believe you met Her Majesty
once before, in Calais,
when she accompanied His
Majesty before her coronation.
I may have. But I have no
recollection of any such meeting.
And, alas, I don't play tennis.
Shall we?
Good morrow, John.
Your Majesty.
- Where are you going?
- Out. - Where?
Go back inside.
Where are you going?
I want to know.
It's none of your business.
It is my pleasure that you go back inside. Now.
Majesty.
Mademoiselle.
I like you, Excellency.
You're very clever.
But I don't like the way
your Emperor treats me.
He seems to think that,
as far as Katherine is concerned,
that I act out of spite,
or that I am being malicious.
But I swear it's not true.
I suppose I ought
to be content in the knowledge
that the world knows
the many wrongs that have
been done to me.
You don't approve of the changes
I'm making in this kingdom.
Cromwell intercepts
some of your letters.
We used to call it Humanism.
Wolsey, More and me.
We were all Humanists.
Most people think
I've changed, but I haven't.
At heart I'm still a Humanist.
Chapuys,
I promise you
that I am going to make such
a reformation in this kingdom
that I shall be
remembered eternally
throughout all Christendom.
I have no doubt what so ever
that Your Majesty's reign
will always be remembered.
I had planned a banquet
in his honor...
- Who?
- The French Admiral.
He has been here for 2 weeks already,
staying with the Duke of Suffolk,
and he has not yet sent me
a message of goodwill.
Every other French envoy
has always done so.
Neither has he requested
an audience with me.
With me, the Queen of England
and when we are discussing
the future of my own child.
Your Majesty should rest.
I ought to leave you... They also
tell me he has struck up an acquaintance
with the Imperial Ambassador, Chapuys.
Is that not extraordinary? Tell me
why should he do such a thing?
Why do you not say anything, Mark?
Your Majesty must forgive me.
I don't know what to say.
These matters are beyond my competence.
What am I? Only a dancing-master.
And then there's something else:
someone, some bitch
who probably hates me...
Told me that the King
has deliberately invited
a lot of beautiful women to court
for the Admiral's visit.
I mean can you believe that?
- Your Grace.
- Your Majesty.
May I present his Excellency,
Philippe Chabot de Brion,
the Admiral of France.
- Majesty.
- Welcome to my court.
Allow me to introduce my wife,
Queen Anne.
Madame.
Please, let us be seated.
Some wine?
Of course. Which domain does
it come from? Is it Bordeaux?
- This is English wine.
- English wine?
We have been making wine
in England since the Romans.
As recently as that?
Tr?s bien.
It's very fruity.
And strong. Like a...
... gladiator's sweats! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Who is that gentleman?
My secretary, Monsieur Gontier.
I should like to
introduce him to my wife.
Excuse me.
<i>Enchant?, mademoiselle.</i>
<i>Majest?</i>
Your Majesty must forgive me
for not being able to attend
the banquet you arranged in my honor.
It was most unfortunate,
but His Grace the Duke of Suffolk,
and his charming wife,
have kept me a virtual
prisoner in their castle.
I was... how shall I say?
... imprisoned by affection.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Madame? Are you amusing
yourself at my expense?
Forgive me, Monsieur.
I could not help laughing
at the King's proposition of
introducing your secretary to me.
For whilst he was finding him,
he met that pretty lady,
and forgot the whole thing.
Let's talk some business.
What instructions do you
have from your master,
with regard to the betrothal of my
daughter Elizabeth to the Duke of Angouleme?
His Majesty regrets that such
a proposition is impossible.
Why "impossible"?
Much as he loves Your Majesty,
the King cannot agree
to betroth his beloved son to a...
... to a bride whose legitimacy
is not accepted by
his Holiness Pope Paul,
by Holy Church itself,
nor even by the Emperor.
However, His Majesty,
to demonstrate his love,
proposes another match.
He would consent
to the betrothal of the Dauphin...
to Lady Mary, your
legitimate daughter.
If you do not agree to
the match, my master
will marry his son to
the Emperor's daughter...
leaving your country
isolated in Europe.
Excellence, your audience with
His Majesty is now over.
I'm sorry.
I have no excuses, Catherine.
I thought those days were behind me.
Perhaps human nature
can never change.
I swear to you it will
never happen again.
I love you too much.
I have no right to ask
you to believe me.
But it's true.
You see...
... you did make me cry, after all.
Who was she?
Who was who?
That lady you were talking to,
when you were supposed to be
finding Monsieur Gontier.
I don't know.
Is she one of your mistresses?
How many do you have?
What are their names?
Where do you keep them?
Someone told me that your nobles,
like Brandon, are assisting
you in having your affairs.
That's enough.
No.
No. You told me...
you always told me
that we should be
truthful with each other.
You said it was the
definition of love.
Then here's the truth:
you must shut your eyes and endure
like your betters have done before you.
How can you say that to me?
Don't you know that I love you
a thousand times more
than Katherine ever did!
And don't you know that
I can drag you down
as quickly as I raised you?
This is lucky you have
your bed already, madam,
because if you did not,
I wouldn't give it to you again.
Francis won't accept to the betrothal.
- Why?
- Why do you think?!
Because the Pope
and he and the Emperor
all agree she's a bastard!
And you are not my wife!
Tell me: how's your Catherine?
She's fine.
In fact... she's with child.
Ah! You're a happily married man, Charles.
I envy you.
Do you think the planets influence our lives?
I don't know.
I would often discuss the issue with More.
We would stand on the roof at nights,
and study the heavens.
More had a great knowledge of the stars
and how they influence our...
... humors.
I regret now what happened to More.
In some ways I wish it never happened.
But it wasn't all my fault.
Whenever my resolve weakened,
whenever I was inclined to save him...
a certain person would privately
urged me on to his destruction.
Who?
You know who she is, Charles.
Précédemment...
Votre Saint-Père vous présente
<i>ses larmes d'affliction et sa colère</i>
<i>pour la mort en martyrs
de Sir Thomas More</i>
<i>et du Cardinal Fisher.</i>
- Comment va ma mère ?
- Très mal, hélas.
Elle est souffrante, mais supplie le Roi
de l'autoriser à vous voir.
Un jour, Sa Majesté se ravisera.
Je suis sûre qu'il m'aime toujours.
Je suis incapable
de donner un fils au Roi.
Tant que Mary est vivante,
elle pourrait devenir Reine.
Votre fille sera l'héritière du trône.
Mais le Roi peut changer d'avis.
Si Elizabeth était promise
au fils du Roi François,
nul ne remettrait en cause
sa légitimité.
Je n'en veux pas au Roi.
Il a été ensorcelé.
Pour cela, elle devra mourir.
Votre sœur est une très belle femme.
Mais pas autant que son frère.
Je viens pour le compte de ma maîtresse.
Si vous m'aimez encore,
- vous plaiderez sa cause.
- Je suis désolé.
<i>Qu'en est-il de l'inspection
des lieux de cultes ?</i>
Les moines, en de nombreux endroits,
sont si pervers et corrompus
<i>que vos inspecteurs désespèrent
de pouvoir les réformer.</i>
À Nuremberg,
le clergé est autorisé à se marier.
L'illégalité de ce mariage
fera du tort à sa carrière.
Je regrette ce qui est arrivé à More.
Une personne m'a incitée, en privé,
à le détruire.
Vous savez qui elle est, Charles.
Sa Majesté consent
aux fiançailles du Dauphin
... à Lady Mary.
- François a refusé les fiançailles.
- Pourquoi ?
Car le Pape, lui-même et l'Empereur
considèrent tous
qu'elle est une bâtarde !
Et que vous n'êtes pas mon épouse !
Tout ce que je sais de Mary,
c'est qu'elle sera
la cause de ma mort...
et moi de la sienne.

THE TUDORS
Saison 2 - Épisode 7
Traduction : dmbmh

Relecture : Lucille
[www.seriessub.com ]
Votre Majesté.
- Messieurs.
- Votre Majesté.
Qu'est-ce cela ?
Le "Valor Ecclesiasticus",
le rapport d'enquête des inspecteurs
sur les richesses et les pratiques
de tous les lieux de culte
du royaume de Votre Majesté.
Elle comporte le décompte
des richesses, des biens...
et des vastes propriétés des monastères,
prieurés et autres
établissements religieux.
Il comporte en outre,
les innombrables cas de laxisme,
de corruption...
de pratiques néfastes et de fraude,
qui ont prospéré, sans aucun contrôle,
et dans certains cas durant des siècles,
dans ces mêmes institutions.
Pendant ce temps, Majesté,
votre trésor personnel s'est appauvri.
N'est-ce pas là un fait étonnant ?
La richesse de ceux
qui devraient être vos sujets
et la pauvreté et les créances
de la Couronne d'Angleterre ?
En effet.
George !
- Sir Henry.
- Votre Majesté,
je viens faire la cour à Lady Sheldon,
- avec la permission du Roi.
- Oui, bien sûr.
Je...
Je profite de cette occasion
pour témoigner
à Votre Majesté
mon amour et ma dévotion.
En tant que réformateur, je sais
l'excellent travail que vous faites,
sans jamais chercher de reconnaissance,
bien que vous l'ayez toujours méritée.
Quand je visite des lieux de cultes,
j'exhorte leurs occupants
à assainir et purifier leurs vies
et leurs doctrines corrompues,
ou ils seront sûrement détruits.
En effet.
Nous, évangélistes,
avons le devoir de...
d'insuffler une nouvelle vie
dans ces vieux corps
et d'encourager les ignorants
à croire en l'importance de la foi
et en la parole de Dieu.
Je vois que nous nous comprenons,
Sir Henry.
Lady Sheldon.
Sir Henry Norris
est venu vous faire la cour.
Milord.
Madame.
- Vous vouliez me voir ?
- Oui.
J'ai encore fait le même rêve.
Je vous l'avais dit :
je serai la cause de sa mort,
- et elle de la mienne.
- Pour l'amour de Dieu !
Tant qu'elles seront en vie,
je ne serai pas en sécurité !
Pourquoi Catherine ne meurt-elle pas ?
- Ils disent tous qu'elle est malade.
- Arrêtez !
Je me disais que si Henry partait
à l'étranger, je serais nommée régente.
Je pourrai ordonner leurs morts.
Vous êtes folle. Arrêtez !
Écoutez-moi.
Vous êtes la Reine d'Angleterre.
Agissez en tant que telle !
Après tout,
vous étiez une des dames de Catherine.
Prenez exemple sur son comportement.
Elle n'a jamais trahi
ses vrais sentiments.
Ne pouvez-vous faire comme elle ?
- Ressembler à Catherine ?
- Oui !
Vous m'avez bien entendu.
Au moins, ayez l'air heureuse.
Et non pas accablée de tristesse !
Père Abbot !
Qu'y a-t-il, Frère John ?
Une lettre du Roi.
Nous allons devoir fermer.
Sur ordre de M. Cromwell.
Je ne comprends pas.
Donnez-moi cette lettre.
Qu'avons-nous fait, mon Père ?
Je l'ignore.
Que va-t-il advenir de nous ?
Pouvez-vous demander
à l'Ambassadeur français que François
revienne sur sa décision et accepte...
le mariage d'Elizabeth avec son fils ?
- Je pourrais.
- N'est-ce pas important ?
L'avenir de votre fille
n'est-il pas important ?
Bien sûr que si.
- Dans ce cas, je...
- Vous comprenez sûrement que son refus
de ce mariage était déjà insultant.
Voulez-vous que je le supplie ?
Non. Bien sûr que non.
Ma chérie...
le goûteur l'a vérifié.
Ce n'est pas empoisonné.
En fait...
il serait préférable de conclure
une alliance avec l'Empereur.
- Cela arrangera Catherine.
- Ceci ne la concerne en rien.
Cela concerne l'Angleterre.
Et les intérêts de l'Angleterre.
Après tout,
je suis supposé m'en préoccuper.
Je suis désolée. Pardonnez-moi.
Vous n'avez aucune raison de l'être.
Vous vous occupez de notre fille,
c'est votre rôle.
Mais les affaires importantes
sont de mon ressort.
Avez-vous compris ?
Quel plaisir de vous avoir
tous deux à ma table, Votre Grâce.
Dites-moi, allez-vous fermer
certains lieux de culte ?
En effet, je commence à le faire.
Mais encore ?
J'ai l'intention d'abolir
tous les jours fériés
survenant durant les jours ouvrables,
et lors des moissons.
Ces vacances forcées
nuisent à l'économie du pays,
bloquent le travail et en conséquence,
appauvrissent les travailleurs.
Et les prêtres ?
En ce qui concerne le clergé,
nous émettrons une série d'injonctions
les obligeant à prêcher la suprématie.
Une autre injonction exigera
des parents et des employeurs
d'enseigner aux enfants et aux employés
la Prière au Seigneur, les règles
de la foi et les Dix Commandements.
En anglais, plutôt qu'en latin.
Et tous les hommes d'Église
devront combattre
les cultes archaïques
entourant les icônes et les reliques.
Il serait plus utile pour leurs âmes
d'offrir aux pauvres et aux nécessiteux
ce qu'ils gaspillent pour des reliques.
C'est très bien, Messieurs.
Mais permettez-moi de réprouver.
Je doute que vous alliez assez loin
ou assez vite.
Votre épouse
est plutôt radicale, Thomas.
En effet... Et illégale.
Deux bonnes raisons pour la cacher.
Être transportée dans une caisse
n'a rien d'amusant.
Je suis désolé de vous l'imposer,
ma chérie.
Je ne suis pas votre chérie,
ni celle de personne.
Je suis une femme
et je veux qu'on respecte mes idées !
À mes yeux,
le catholicisme est néfaste !
Les gens sont maintenus
dans une ignorance totale
et on les rend coupables
de leurs corps et de leurs pensées.
Pire encore, cette idée que
les riches peuvent s'acheter
une place au paradis.
Je suis d'accord. L'Église catholique
est corrompue. C'est irrémédiable.
Vous devez donc la détruire
totalement et sans aucune pitié.
Voici ce que je vous conseille,
M. Cromwell.
Maintenant, vous pouvez
me remettre dans ma caisse !
Bonne soirée, Votre Grâce.
Bonne soirée, M. le Secrétaire.
Allez-y.
Que faites-vous ici, Thomas ?
Voir la misère à laquelle
nous sommes contraintes ?
Non.
Je n'en apprécie pas la vue.
Pourquoi restez-vous ?
Revenez à la cour.
J'aime la Reine.
Rien dans ce monde
ne m'obligera à la quitter.
Je suis une catholique.
Je crois en ma religion.
Les poètes ne croient
peut-être en rien ?
En l'amour, peut-être.
Embrassez-moi,
puis vous me laisserez en paix
... pour toujours.
Elizabeth.
Sir ?
Pardonnez-moi.
J'aurais dû vous prévenir de ma visite.
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Mon nom est John Leland.
Je suis le bibliothécaire de Sa Majesté.
Ce prieuré possède une bibliothèque,
si je ne m'abuse ?
En effet, M. Leland.
Elle contient de précieux et anciens
manuscrits et textes.
Nous en sommes très fiers.
Le Roi m'a mandaté
pour passer en revue
toutes les bibliothèques
des lieux de cultes allant être fermés.
Il tient à préserver
tous ces trésors littéraires.
Envisagez-vous de nous les saisir ?
Naturellement.
Ils seront conservés
dans la Bibliothèque Royale.
Sa Majesté m'a aussi ordonné
de trouver tout écrit
qui pourrait approuver la suprématie
du Roi et la nouvelle monarchie.
Je ne crois pas, M. Leland,
que vous trouverez ici de tels écrits !
Votre Majesté.
Elizabeth !
Ma chérie.
Mère.
Bonjour.
Vous pouvez nous laisser, Lady Bryan.
Ma fille bien-aimée. Ma chérie.
Pourquoi êtes-vous partie ?
- Vous ai-je manqué ?
- Oui.
Je vous ai manqué ?
Et vous m'avez manqué.
Beaucoup.
Ici...
Et là...
Je l'ai vu.
J'ai vu un petit poisson.
Où est le petit poisson, ma chérie ?
Vous êtes-vous récemment
entretenu avec la Reine ?
Elle me donne motif à préoccupation.
Le Roi n'est plus
autant amoureux d'elle.
- Que lui arrive-t-il ?
- Je l'ignore.
Elle a peut-être peur.
Pauvre George.
Seriez-vous devenu inepte ?
- Pas du tout.
- J'espère que non.
Voyez-vous, George,
les enjeux sont trop grands.
Qui sera lâche aujourd'hui
maudira ce jour
et regrettera son infortune.
Les gens prospères ne voient
la peur que chez les autres.
Allez parler à votre sœur !
- Mieux ?
- Bien mieux, merci.
Mesdames.
N'est-ce pas mieux, George ?
Beaucoup mieux.
- Voulez-vous danser, Milord ?
- Non. Pas maintenant.
Milord.
Vous l'aimez encore,
après tout ce temps.
Vous avez tort, Milord.
Mon amour s'est éteint depuis longtemps.
Votre Majesté.
Mark !
Jouez-nous une Volta.
Je veux concevoir à nouveau.
Je veux concevoir un fils.
Un fils qui serait
à l'image de son père.
Mais je ne peux pas.
Pourquoi ?
Tant qu'elles seront en vie,
je ne pourrai avoir de fils.
Que voulez-vous dire ?
Catherine et sa fille...
Insinuez-vous que je doive les tuer ?
Mary...
Est-ce vous ?
Elizabeth.
Madame.
Je n'ai pas vu ma fille depuis...
plus de quatre ans.
N'est-il pas cruel
de l'éloigner de moi ?
Oui, Madame.
Mon cœur brûle.
Relisez-moi encore
le Jugement de la Curie.
S'il vous plaît.
"Nous déclarons que
le mariage entre Henry VIII
"et Catherine d'Aragon
"demeure irrévocable et canonique,
"et que leur descendance
"restera pour toujours,
légale et légitime."
Voyez-vous,
ceci est la vérité éternelle
qu'aucun être humain ne peut renier.
Saint-Père, Éminences,
le prochain sujet de notre débat...
Alessandro !
Laissez-moi vous regarder.
Comme vous avez grandi.
Vous serez bientôt un homme.
- Êtes-vous sincère et pur ?
- <i>Si</i>, Grand-père.
Êtes-vous humble
dans vos prières à Dieu ?
Certainement.
Brave garçon.
Laissez-nous.
Il fera un très bon Cardinal.
Ne pensez-vous pas ?
Messeigneurs, nous avons
d'autres affaires à traiter.
Tout d'abord,
j'ai invité le sculpteur Michel-Ange
à peindre "le Jugement Dernier"
dans la Chapelle Sixtine.
Saint-Père,
certains réprouvent encore
la fresque du dôme.
Je sais. Moi aussi d'ailleurs.
Mais à présent, elle me plaît.
Le coût n'en sera pas élevé ?
Non, nous le payerons très peu.
Il n'est qu'un artiste, après tout.
Que faisons-nous au sujet
du Roi d'Angleterre ?
Je vais vous conter une histoire.
Un jour, enfant, je suis parti nager,
et le courant
m'a entraîné vers le large,
loin du rivage, vers les eaux profondes.
J'ai prié Dieu à haute voix,
et vint une vague amicale
qui me ramena vers le rivage.
Il en va de même
pour le Roi d'Angleterre.
Il a été entraîné loin du rivage,
mais il l'ignore.
Il n'a pas demandé le secours de Dieu.
Il n'a pas demandé notre secours.
Il pense pouvoir nager seul.
Mais bientôt, il comprendra
qu'il ne nage pas, mais qu'il sombre.
Pourquoi pleurez-vous
comme des enfants ?
Ce ne sont rien que des idoles !
Qui sont ces hommes, mon Père ?
Des Bretons... français.
- Des huguenots.
- Des protestants ?
M. Cromwell a dû penser
que des Anglais ne pouvaient pas
détruire leur patrimoine
et déshonorer leur religion.
La Reine !
Votre Majesté...
Excusez-moi.
Je viens voir le Roi.
Sa Majesté est partie tôt, ce matin
chasser avec le Duc de Suffolk
et d'autres nobles.
Suffolk ?
Oui, Madame.
Je m'en souviens. Il me l'avait dit.
Une belle prise.
Voulez-vous retourner au palais ?
Y a-t-il un lieu
où l'on puisse séjourner ?
À Wulfhall.
Wulfhall...
- À qui est cette demeure ?
- À Sir John Seymour.
Je me souviens de lui.
Il était avec nous en France.
Allons lui faire la surprise.
Sir John !
Qui m'appelle ?
Sir John, vous avez un invité inattendu.
- Votre Majesté.
- Sir John.
Vous êtes le bienvenu.
Que Votre Majesté pardonne
la lenteur de ma cuisine.
Vous prenez parfaitement
soin de nous, Sir John.
Le Duc et moi évoquions
la campagne de France.
Oui...
Dommage qu'il n'y ait eu
qu'une seule bataille.
Mais quelle bataille !
Je me souviens de notre assaut.
Sa Grâce dirigeant l'avant-garde
avec un immense courage.
Les Français ont été écrasés
et déroutés lors de la charge
- abandonnant le champ de bataille.
- On ne voyait plus que leurs éperons.
Je dois dire à Votre Majesté que vous
avez fasciné l'Ambassadeur milanais.
Il m'a dit : "Le Roi était plus frais
après la bataille.
J'ignore comment il y parvient !"
Aux victoires passées.
À John.
Mary ?
Oh, Mary !
Ma fille...
Oh, chérie...
Est-ce bien vous ?
Ne pleurez pas.
Laissez-moi vous regarder.
Vous voici.
Je ne vous ai pas vue
depuis si longtemps.
Une éternité.
Et vous voilà.
Ma chère enfant.
Ma fille bien-aimée.
Mon ange.
Ma vie.
Mary...
Mon trésor.
Elle était ici.
Elle est venue me voir.
Oui, Madame.
Je sais.
Laissez-moi quérir le médecin.
Non.
Je ne veux pas de médecin.
Je me suis mise entre les mains de Dieu.
Que Dieu tout puissant
vous accorde sa clémence
et qu'il vous pardonne vos péchés.
Et que Jésus Christ
vous guide vers la vie éternelle.
Je suis si triste, Mark.
Pourquoi donc ?
Si j'avais un fils...
Si j'avais un fils, avec lui
viendrait un monde en or.
Je n'avais jamais vu autant de boue.
J'étais décontenancé.
Lorsque votre cheval
s'est enlisé jusqu'à la croupe,
je n'oublierai jamais votre visage.
Que pouvais-je faire ?
J'étais en armure !
Votre Majesté,
puis-je vous présenter ma fille,
Lady Jane Seymour.
Jane.
Votre Majesté,
M. Cromwell est ici.
Madame.
Vous désiriez me voir ?
Mon père m'a dit
que vous étiez déterminé à fermer
tous les lieux de culte. Est-ce vrai ?
En effet.
Votre Majesté doit savoir
que l'inspection des églises a montré
que la fraude, le laxisme
et les abus étaient monnaie courante.
Pourtant, certains de ces lieux
ont eu de bons rapports.
N'est-ce pas vrai aussi ?
J'ai également appris
que tous les biens des monastères
seront transférés au trésor du Roi.
En effet, j'entends faire du Roi
le plus riche souverain d'Europe.
Mais une partie de ces biens
pourrait trouver une meilleure utilité.
- Une meilleure utilité ?
- Oui.
Comme dons pour des causes
charitables et éducatives.
Wolsey lui-même l'a fait.
Madame, je suis surpris
de vous voir mettre en doute
la politique du Roi que votre père
et votre frère ont pleinement soutenue.
Je mets en doute cette politique,
car je ne suis pas certaine
qu'elle soit celle du Roi.
Vous avez bien trop d'influence,
M. Cromwell !
Faites attention
ou je vous ferais trancher la tête.
Je sais que je vais mourir.
Je demande à ce que mes dettes
soient acquittées,
et mes domestiques récompensés
pour leurs loyaux services.
Je souhaite être enterrée
dans le couvent des Moines Observants.
Et je voudrais
que 500 messes soient dites
pour le repos de mon âme.
Et que quelqu'un se rende
au Sanctuaire
de Notre-Dame de Walsingham...
pour prier pour mon salut.
À ma fille, Mary...
je laisse...
mon collier en or
que j'ai ramené d'Espagne,
et mes fourrures.
Laissez-moi vous aider, Madame.
Merci, ma loyale
et bien-aimée Elizabeth.
Je dois écrire au Roi.
"Mon Seigneur
"et bien-aimé époux.
"Je me recommande à vous.
"L'heure de ma mort approche,
"et mon état est tel...
"que le tendre amour que je vous porte
"m'oblige à vous remémorer
"l'importance du bien-être
"et de la sauvegarde de votre âme,
<i>"que vous devez préférer</i>
<i>"à toutes autres considérations</i>
<i>"de ce monde charnel,
quelles quelles soient.</i>
<i>"Pour lesquelles vous m'avez précipitée
dans de nombreuses misères,</i>
<i>"et vous-même en de nombreux soucis.</i>
<i>"Pour ma part...</i>
<i>"je vous pardonne tout.</i>
<i>"Oui...</i>
<i>"J'exprime le vœu</i>
<i>"et je prie Dieu</i>
"qu'il vous pardonne aussi.
"Pour le reste,
"je recommande à vos bons soins
"notre fille, Mary,
"vous implorant
de lui être un bon père
"comme je l'ai toujours souhaité.
"Et enfin,
"je jure
"que mes yeux vous désirent
plus que tout."
Aidez-moi, Elizabeth.
In manus tuas commendo
spiritum meum.
Madame.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
À présent, je suis vraiment Reine.
Elizabeth ?
Doux Jésus !
- Voici mon épouse, Catherine.
- Sir John.
Ces Majestés arrivent.
Milady.
Vos Majestés.
Vos Majestés.
Allez voir les combats
de coqs, ma chérie.
Milady.
Vous ne jouez pas, Mark ?
Pas aujourd'hui, Milord.
Mais ce soir, peut-être.
J'ignore si je peux.
Lui avez-vous parlé de moi ?
De nous ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Vous êtes comme un dieu ici.
Si vous lisiez le grec, Maître Smeaton,
vous sauriez que même les dieux
ont des problèmes avec leurs épouses.
Sir John.
Votre Majesté.
Nous voulions une fois encore
vous remercier pour votre hospitalité.
D'autant plus que notre
visite était inattendue.
Sire, vous nous avez fait
un immense honneur.
Et la chambre où vous avez dormi
sera désormais connue
comme "La chambre du Roi".
Votre fille Jane
devrait venir à la cour,
comme dame de compagnie de la Reine.
Merci, Votre Majesté.
C'est beaucoup d'honneur
fait à notre famille.
Chérie, venez ici.
Père.
Mon Elizabeth.
Garde, protégez-moi !
Non !
En garde ! Vous allez me protéger !
- Protégez votre Roi !
- Mère.
Mon Père.
Mon Elizabeth.
Anne.
Oui, père.
J'ai eu vent d'événements
qui m'ont inquiété.
De quels événements ?
Il semblerait que vous vous soyez
querellée avec M. Cromwell.
Nous avons eu un désaccord,
sur une importante affaire d'État.
Vous n'êtes pas devenue Reine
pour exprimer vos opinions
ou pour vous quereller
avec les plus proches du Roi.
Mais je suis la plus proche du Roi !
Je suis l'épouse du Roi !
N'oubliez pas
comment vous y êtes parvenue !
Je sais comment j'y suis parvenue !
Ce n'était pas entièrement grâce à vous.
Ce n'était pas entièrement grâce à vous
ou Norfolk ou George...
ou toute autre personne.
C'était aussi grâce à moi.
Il est tombé amoureux de moi.
Il m'a respecté...
moi et mes opinions.
Que vous arrive-t-il ?
Vous n'avez pas à vous inquiéter.
Il n'y a que de bonnes nouvelles.
Catherine est morte !
Et moi...
je suis enceinte.
Comprenez-vous ?
Je porte
le fils du Roi.
Nous sommes aux portes d'un âge d'or !

Previously on The Tudors...
your Holy Father offers you
his tears of grief and his anger
at the martyrdom of Sir Thomas More
and Cardinal Fisher.
- How is my mother?
- Alas, she is very unwell.
She is sinking, but always begs
the King of his mercy to
- be allowed to see you.
- I am sure he will one day relent.
I believe that he still
loves and cares for me.
I am unable to give a King a son.
So long as Mary is alive,
she could be Queen.
Your daughter will be made
heir of the throne.
But the King can change his mind.
If Elizabeth was betrothed
to King Francis' son,
then her legitimacy would no longer
be questioned by anyone.
I still do not blame the King.
He's been seduced by witchcraft.
That is why she must die.
Your sister is a very beautiful woman.
Not as beautiful as her brother.
I came on behalf of My Lady.
If you still have feelings for me,
you would speak out for her.
I'm sorry.
How is your survey of the
religious houses progressing?
They have found the monks and
many places so depraved and so corrupt
that your commissioners already despair
of any perfect reformation.
In Nuremberg,
clergy are allowed to marry.
It won't do his career much good here.
Being illegal.
I regret now what happened to More.
A certain person would privately
urge me on to his destruction.
You know who she is, Charles.
His Majesty consent to
the betrothal of the Dauphin
... to Lady Mary.
- Francis won't accept the betrothal.
- Why?
Because the Pope and he and the Emperor
all agree she is a bastard!
And you are not my wife!
This is all I know of Mary
that she is my death
... and I am hers.

Your Majesty.
- Gentlemen.
- Your Majesty.
What's this?
"The Valor Ecclesiasticus."
the results of the Commissioner's
investigations
into the wealth and practices
of all the religious houses
in Your Majesty's kingdom.
It lists the treasures, the wealth and
the vast private lands
of the monasteries, priories
and other religious establishments.
It as well lists the innumerable
cases of laxity,
corruption,
evil practice and fraud
which have flourished, unchecked,
and in some cases
for hundreds of years,
in these same institutions.
Meanwhile, Majesty,
your own treasury is much depleted.
Is it not a thing to marvel at,
the richness of those who ought
by right to be your subjects,
and the poverty and debt
of the English Crown?
It is, indeed.
George.
- Sir Henry.
- Your Majesty.
I came again to
pay court to Lady Sheldon,
with the King's permission.
- Yes. Yes, of course.
- I...
I also wanted an opportunity to express
my love and devotion to Your Majesty.
As a reformer myself,
I know all the good works you do,
without ever
seeking any praise,
but always deserving it.
When I visit religious houses,
I do so to urge those inside
to cleanse and purify their
corrupt lives and doctrine,
or else they will surely be destroyed.
Yes... Yes, it's true.
We evangelicals must
breathe new life into dead bones
and encourage the ignorant
to believe in priority of faith
and the word of God.
I see we understand each other,
Sir Henry.
Lady Sheldon...
Sir Henry Norris has come courting.
My Lord.
Madam.
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.
I had the dream again.
- Anne.
- I told you.
- I am her death and she is mine.
- For God's sake.
So long as they are both alive,
I can't be safe.
Why doesn't Katherine just die?
- Everyone keeps telling how ill she is.
- Stop it.
I had a thought. The next time Henry
goes abroad, I shall be left as Regent.
I can just order their deaths.
You're crazy. Stop it.
Stop it!
Listen to me.
You're the Queen of England.
For the love of God, act like it.
After all,
you were a Lady to Queen Katherine.
You saw and heard how she behaved.
It seemed to me she never
betrayed her real feelings.
Can you not be more like her?
- More like Katherine?
- Yes.
You heard me.
At least seem happy.
Not a heap of misery!
Father Abbot...
What is it, brother John.
A letter from the King.
We are to be suppressed.
By the orders of Mr. Cromwell.
I don't understand.
Give me the letter.
What have we done, Father?
I don't know.
What is to become of us?
Will you ask the French
Ambassador again
if Francis will not
relent and agree...
to the marriage of
Elizabeth to his son?
- I might.
- Don't you think it's important?
Don't you think the future
of your daughter is important?
- Of course, I do.
- Well then...
Surely you understand
that Francis' refusal
to agree to the marriage in
the first place was insulting.
- Do you want me to go back and beg?
- No. Of course not.
Sweetheart...
it's been tasted.
It's not poisonous.
The fact of the matter is
it might be better for us to pursue
an alliance with the Emperor.
- That would suit Katherine.
- It has nothing to do with Katherine.
It has to do with England.
And England's interests.
After all,
I am supposed to be concerned with that.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
You have no reason to be.
You care for our daughter,
as you should.
But leave the greater
things to my care.
Do you understand?
What a pleasure to have you
and your lovely wife to serve.
So tell me, you're suppressing
some religious houses?
I am starting to, yes.
And what else?
I am intending to abolish
almost all the holidays that
fall during the law terms
and during the harvest.
These forced holidays, they damage
the country's economy,
stop vital works, and in fact they also
impoverish workers.
And the priests?
As far as the clergy are concerned
we mean to issue a set of injunctions
requiring them to
preach the Supremacy.
There will also be an injunction
requiring parents and employers
to teach their children and
servants the Lord's Prayer,
Creed and the Ten Commandments
in English rather than in Latin.
And all clerics will be put
on notice to attack
the superstitious cult
surrounding images and relics.
It will more profit their souls
to bestow upon the poor and the needy
what they currently waste on relics.
That's very good, gentlemen.
But allow me to chide you.
I don't think that you're going
far enough, or fast enough.
Your wife is, quite radical, Thomas.
She is. And illegal.
Two reasons to hide her.
Being carried around in a box
does not make you laugh.
My dear, I am sorry about that.
I am not your dear. I am nobody's dear.
I am a woman and I demand
equal respect for my ideas.
For me, the practices of the
Catholic church are evil.
The way people are
kept in total ignorance
and made to feel guilty about their
own bodies and their own thoughts.
And even worse, the idea that
the rich can buy a plot in
heaven for their souls.
I agree with you. The Catholic Church
is corrupted. It's irredeemable.
Then you should smash and destroy
it utterly and totally
and without pity.
That is my advice to you, Mr. Cromwell.
Now you can put me back in my box.
Good evening, your Grace.
Good evening, Mr. Secretary.
- Ready.
- Giddy up!
Why are you here, Thomas?
To see the degradation that
we have been forced to?
No.
I don't like to see it.
I wonder why you stay.
Why don't you come back to court?
I love the Queen.
Nothing in this world
will make me leave her.
I am a Catholic.
I believe in my faith.
Perhaps you poets don't
believe in anything?
In love, perhaps.
You may kiss me.
Then you will leave me alone.
Forever.
Elizabeth.
Sir?
Ah, forgive me.
I should have warned you of
my impending visit.
- Who are you?
- My name is John Leland.
I am His Majesty's librarian.
You keep a library
in the priory, I believe?
We do, indeed, Mr. Leland.
It contains many fine and
old manuscripts and texts.
We are very proud of it.
The King has commissioned me
to peruse and diligently search
all the libraries belonging to those
religious houses about to be suppressed.
He is anxious to preserve
all their literary treasures.
You mean you intend to
remove them from here?
Naturally.
They will be housed
in the Royal Libraries.
But...
His Majesty has also
ordered me to find texts
that would emphasize the Royal
Supremacy and the New Monarchy.
I do not think, Mr. Leland,
that you will find
many such texts here.
Your Majesty?
Elizabeth...
Oh, my own heart.
Ma... mama.
Hello.
You may leave us now, Lady Bryan.
My dear girl... My sweetheart.
Why do you leave?
- Have you missed me?
- Yes.
You missed me? I missed you.
So much.
Here...
And here...
I see one.
I see a little fishie.
Where do you see  fishies, my darling?
- Have you talked to the Queen recently?
- Yes.
She's giving me cause for concern.
The King is not so much
in love with her as he used to be.
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't know.
Perhaps she's afraid.
Poor George.
Have you gone softheaded?
- Me? No.
- I hope not.
You see, George,
the stakes are too high.
Whoever is a coward now will
soon rue the day,
and regret his misfortune.
Successful people only
recognize fear in others.
Go and talk to your sister again!
- Better?
- Much, thank you.
Ladies.
Is this not better, George?
Much better.
- Will you dance, My Lord?
- No. Not now.
My Lord.
All this time
and you're still in love with her.
You're wrong, My Lord.
My love was sprung and
spent a long time ago.
Your Majesty.
Mark.
Play a volta.
I want to conceive again.
I want to conceive a son.
A son to be the living
image of his father.
But I can't.
Why?
As long as they're alive,
I can't conceive a son.
What are you saying?
Katherine and her daughter.
Are you saying you want
me to kill them?
Mary...
Is it you?
Elizabeth.
Madam.
I have not seen my daughter
for more than four years.
Is it not cruel of them
to keep her from me?
Gentle Madam, yes.
It burns my heart.
Read the Curia's Judgment to me again.
Please.
"We pronounce that the marriage
between Henry VIII
"and Katherine of Aragon
"stands firm and canonical,
"and their issue
still stands lawful and legitimate."
You see?
This is the eternal truth...
which no man can ever deny.
Holy Father, Eminences,
The next item for our deliberation...
Alessandro!
Let me look at you.
Well, well, well, how you've grown.
You're almost a man.
- Are you honest and clean?
- <i>Si</i>, grandfather.
When you pray to God
are you truly humble?
Sure.
Good boy.
Off you go.
He'll make a fine Cardinal.
Don't you think?
Monsignors, we have other
business to discuss.
First,
I have invited the sculptor
Michelangelo to paint
a Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel.
Holy Father,
 there are still people
who object to his work on the ceiling.
I know. I did myself.
But now I like it.
Won't the Judgment be expensive?
No. We won't pay him very much.
He's only an artist, after all.
What of the King of
England's Great Matter?
I will tell you a story.
Once, when I was a boy, I went swimming,
and the tide carried me away,
far from the shore,
into the deepest water.
It was then I prayed aloud to God,
and a friendly wave came
and pushed me back to the shore.
So it is with the King of England.
He has been carried
far from the shore
but he does not know it.
He does not ask for God's help.
He does not ask for our help.
He thinks he can swim alone.
But very soon he will realize
he is not swimming but drowning.
Come on! Come on, hurry!
Why are you crying like a baby?
These are nothing but idols.
Come on! Come on, goats!
Father, who are these men?
Bretons. From France.
- Huguenots.
- Protestants?
Perhaps Mr. Secretary
Cromwell felt that he couldn't
trust Englishmen to destroy
their own heritage
and besmirch their own faith.
The Queen!
Your Majesty...
Excuse me. Your Majesty.
I came to see the King.
Madam, His Majesty left
early this morning
to go hunting
with the Duke of Suffolk...
and other nobles.
Suffolk?
Yes, Madam.
I remember now. He told me.
Your Majesty...
A good kill.
Do you want to get back to the palace?
No.
Is there somewhere
around here we can stay?
There's Wulfhall.
Wulfhall...
Who owns that house?
Sir John Seymour and his family.
I remember Sir John.
He was in France with us.
Let's go surprise him.
Sir John...
Who is this shouting?
Sir John, you have an unexpected guest.
- Your Majesty!
- Sir John.
You are most welcome.
Your Majesty must forgive
the tardiness of my kitchen.
I think I am very well
looked after, Sir John.
The Duke and I were reminiscing
about the French campaign.
Ah, yes!
It was a shame we only fought
one battle against them.
Ah, but what a battle.
I remember how we charged at them,
with His Grace leading the vanguard
with tremendous bravery.
And how the French were
broken and routed in the charge
- and fled the field before us.
- All we saw were their spurs.
I must tell Your Majesty that the
Milanese Ambassador was amazed by you.
He said to me, "The King was fresher
after his exertion than before.
I do not know how he can stand it."
To past victories.
To John.
Mary?
Oh, Mary.
My daughter...
Oh, sweetheart.
Is it you?
Don't weep. Don't weep.
Let me look at you.
There you are.
I have not seen you for so long.
An eternity.
And here you are.
Oh, my sweet child.
My beloved child,
my angel,
my world...
Mary...
Mi preciosa.
She was here.
She came to me.
Yes, Madam.
I know.
Let me summon a doctor for you.
No.
I don't want a doctor.
I have wholly committed myself
to the pleasure of God.
May the omnipotent God...
have mercy upon you
and forgive you your sins,
and may Jesus Christ
lead you to eternal life.
Oh, Mark. I'm so sad.
Why sad?
If I had a son...
if I had a son, it would bring
about a golden world.
I had never seen a sea
of mud like that before.
- I didn't know what to think of it.
- When your horse sank up
to its hind quarters in it,
I shall never forget your face.
What was I supposed to do?
I was in full armor.
Your Majesty, may I present my daughter,
Lady Jane Seymour.
Jane.
Your Majesty.
Mr. Secretary Cromwell is here.
Madam.
You wished to see me?
My father tells me you
are determined to close
every religious house
in England. Is it true?
Yes.
As Your Majesty knows,
the church commissioners found that
fraud, laxity and abuse
were commonplace.
Yet some religious houses received
good report. Is that not also true?
I also hear that all the wealth
and assets of the monasteries
are to be transferred
to the King's Treasury.
Indeed. I intend to make
the King the most powerful
and the richest King in Europe.
But surely some of that wealth
could be put to better uses.
- Better uses, Madam?
- Yes.
For endowments to charitable
and educational causes,
which even Wolsey did.
Madam, I am surprised
to hear you question
the King's policy, which your father
and brother whole-heartedly support.
I question the policy, Mr. Secretary,
because I am not convinced
- that it is the King's.
- Madam, I...
You are far
too high-handed, Mr. Cromwell!
You ought to be careful,
or I will have you cropped at the neck.
I know that I must die.
I ask that my debts be cleared
and my servants be recompensed
for the good service
they have done for me.
I wish to be buried in the
convent of the Observant Friars.
And I would wish
that 500 masses be said
for my soul...
and that someone would visit
the Shrine of our Lady of Walsingham
to pray on my behalf.
To my daughter, Mary.
I leave...
my collar of gold
I brought from Spain,
and my furs.
Madam, let me help you.
Thank you, my loyal
and loving Elizabeth.
I must write to the King.
"My Lord
"and dear husband.
"I commend me unto you.
"The hour of my death draws fast on,
"and my case being such...
"the tender love I owe you
"forces me to put you in remembrance
"of the health
"and safeguard of your soul...
"which you ought to prefer
"above all considerations
"of the world of flesh whatsoever,
"for which you have cast
me into many miseries,
"and yourself into many cares.
"For my part...
"I do pardon you all,
"Yea,
"and I do wish
"and pray dearly God
"He will pardon you also.
"For the rest,
"I commend unto you
"our daughter, Mary.
"Beseeching you to be a
good father unto her
"as I have always desired.
"And lastly...
"I vow
"that mine eyes desire you
above all things."
Elizabeth, help me.
In manus tuas commendo
spiritum meum.
Madam...
What is it, Nan?
Now I am indeed Queen.
Elizabeth?
Oh, Jesus...
- This is my wife, Catherine.
- Sir John.
Here comes Her Majesty now.
My Lady.
Your Majesties.
Go watch the cockfight, sweetheart.
My Lady.
Not performing today, Mark?
No, not today, My Lord.
But perhaps later tonight?
I'm not sure.
Have you told her about me? Hm?
About us?
Why the hell not? You're George Boleyn.
You're like a bloody god around here.
If you could read Greek, Master Smeaton,
you'd know that even the gods
had problems with their wives.
Sir John.
Your Majesty.
We wanted to thank you once more
for your generous hospitality.
All the more so because our
visit was so unexpected.
Sire, it was the greatest
possible privilege and pleasure.
And the room Your Majesty slept in
shall forever be known
as "The King's bedroom."
Your daughter Jane
should come to court.
As lady to Her Majesty.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
You do our family a great honor.
Sweetheart. Come here.
Papa...
My Elizabeth.
Guards, guards! Protect me!
Now, men.
En garde! You're going to protect me!
Protect your King!
- My mama.
- Elizabeth.
My papa.
My Elizabeth.
Anne.
Yes, father.
I have heard some
reports that alarm me.
What reports?
It seems you have quarreled
with Mr. Cromwell.
We disagreed
on an important and public issue.
Anne, I did not bring you up
to have opinions
or to express them or to quarrel
with those closest to the Crown.
But I am closest to the Crown.
I am the King's wife.
And you should remember
how you got there!
I know how I got there.
And it was not all you.
It was not all you
or Norfolk or George
or any other man you want to name.
It was also me.
He fell in love with me.
He respected me...
and my opinions.
What is it?
You have no need to worry.
There is good news all round.
Katherine is dead...
and I...
I am pregnant.
Do you understand?
I am carrying
the King's son.
We are on the edge
of a golden world.

Demanderez-vous à François d'accepter
l'union d'Elizabeth et de son fils ?
- Mieux vaut s'allier avec l'Empereur.
- Cela conviendrait à Catherine.
Ceci est de mon ressort.
Il est clair que le Roi n'est plus aussi
amoureux d'elle.
- Quel est son problème ?
- Elle a peut-être peur.
Tant qu'elles sont en vie,
je ne serais pas en sécurité.
- Je pourrais ordonner leurs morts.
- Vous êtes folle. Cessez donc.
Vous êtes Reine d'Angleterre.
Agissez en tant que telle !
À présent, nous devons tous veiller
à ne pas perdre l'amour du Roi
ou tout sera perdu.
Sir John, vous avez un invité.
Votre Majesté, puis-je vous présenter
ma fille, Lady Jane Seymour ?
L'heure de ma mort approche,
et je vous confie notre fille Mary.
Je vous supplie d'être un bon père.
Maintenant, je suis vraiment Reine.
Le Roi d'Angleterre
a été entraîné au large,
mais il l'ignore encore.
Il pense pouvoir nager seul.
Très bientôt il s'apercevra
qu'il ne nage pas, mais qu'il sombre.
Lui avez-vous parlé de moi ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Même les dieux ont des soucis
avec leurs femmes.
Vous tenez à fermer
tous les lieux de culte.
Vous avez bien trop d'influence,
M. Cromwell.
Faites attention
ou je vous ferais couper la tête.
Je ne vous ai pas hissée pour
vous disputer avec les proches du Roi.
- Je suis l'épouse du Roi.
- Alors, rappelez-vous
- comment vous y êtes arrivée !
- Il est tombé amoureux de moi
et m'a respectée.
Jane viendra à la cour
comme suivante de la Reine.
Merci, Votre Majesté.
Je porte
le fils du Roi.
Nous sommes aux portes d'un âge d'or !

Merci, Edward.
Ma sœur.
- Lady Jane ?
- Oui.
Sa Majesté va arriver.
Ne lui parlez que si
vous y avez été invitée.
Très bien.
Votre Majesté.
Dame Seymour, veuillez poser la main
sur la Sainte Bible.
Veuillez jurer et promettre
de servir Sa Majesté, la Reine Anne,
avec loyauté, honneur et bienséance.
Veuillez promettre et jurer
que votre conduite
sera toujours modeste,
vertueuse et parfaite,
offrant, en tout temps,
un aspect pieux aux autres ?
Je le jure et le promets.
Lady Jane.
Votre Majesté.
Le Roi.
Majesté.
M. le Secrétaire.
J'ai réussi, non sans mal,
à obtenir une copie
du rapport d'autopsie
de la Reine Catherine.
- Qu'avez-vous découvert ?
- Les organes internes étaient normaux,
excepté le cœur,
qui présentait une sombre excroissance,
hideuse à voir, sur son côté extérieur.
Qu'en serait la cause ?
Son médecin, qui a toute ma confiance,
m'a dit qu'une telle excroissance
ne pouvait qu'être...
la preuve d'un empoisonnement.
Si son corps avait été
correctement examiné,
on en aurait trouvé des traces.
Pauvre Catherine.
Non.
Nul besoin de prier pour elle.
Son âme pieuse
a trouvé le repos éternel.
Mais je m'inquiète pour sa fille.
Pauvre Mary.
Nous reparlerons plus tard.
- Excellence.
- Votre Majesté.
J'ai appris
qu'il fallait féliciter votre maître.
Il a pris Tunis aux Turcs.
Votre Majesté est très bien informée.
La menace d'une invasion turque
a, en effet, été endiguée
par la victoire de l'Empereur.
La paix s'en suivra.
Mais le sera-t-elle partout ?
Je prie Dieu.
Peut-être qu'un jour,
il n'y aura plus d'utilité à la guerre
ou aux menaces de guerre.
En attendant ce moment,
veuillez transmettre mon amour
et mes félicitations à l'Empereur.
Dites-lui que...
Dites-lui que,
de tous les princes de ce monde,
c'est lui que j'admire le plus.
Cromwell.
À présent qu'il a vaincu les Turcs,
l'Empereur peut nous faire la guerre.
Il y a quelque temps,
j'aurais juré qu'il allait le faire.
Mais plus maintenant.
Avec la mort de Catherine,
la raison de notre inimitié a disparu.
Et je tiens
à renouveler mon amitié avec lui.
Vous irez parler à Chapuys.
Vous trouverez
le prix d'une telle amitié.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Qu'en est-il de nos réformes ?
La loi sur la dissolution des grands
monastères sera présentée au Parlement,
- lors de la prochaine session.
- Bien,
M. Cromwell.
Votre Majesté.
Il y avait autre chose...
Vous avez une femme et un fils,
n'est-ce pas ?
En effet.
Comment s'appelle votre fils ?
Gregory.
J'avais également deux filles, mais...
elles sont mortes.
Amenez votre femme
et votre fils à la cour.
J'aimerais les rencontrer.
Bien sûr, Votre Majesté.
Votre Majesté.
Si Sa Majesté veut bien me suivre.
Braves gens...
Bienvenue.
Voici Sa Majesté la Reine,
en ce Jeudi Saint,
venant vous donner l'aumône
et laver vos pieds.
Que Dieu vous bénisse.
Que Dieu vous protège.
Que Dieu dans sa pitié vous protège.
Regardez ! Il y en a deux fois plus
qu'avec la précédente Reine.
- Que Dieu vous bénisse.
- Que Dieu vous protège.
Votre Sainteté,
Son Altesse Royale, le Roi de France.
Majesté.
Vous venez à nous
en pèlerin et en pénitent.
Vous méritez certainement
les faveurs du ciel.
De tout mon cœur,
je vous souhaite la bienvenue à Rome...
la mère de notre Église.
Alors que d'autres sont tombés,
dans la vanité, l'avarice ou la luxure,
vous nous êtes resté fidèle, à nous...
et à la vérité du Christ.
Comme un enfant à son père,
je vous le dis ici, en présence
de tous les princes
de notre Sainte Église,
que je serais heureux de donner ma vie
afin de vous servir,
de quelque manière que vous voulez.
J'ai décidé d'exécuter
la bulle d'excommunication
contre le Roi Henry d'Angleterre.
Un père doit toujours chercher
un moyen de pardonner à ses enfants,
mais les crimes d'Henry contre nous
et contre notre foi
sont trop vils pour être pardonnés.
De plus,
il n'a montré signe d'aucune repentance,
ni d'acte de contrition.
C'est la vérité.
Le Roi d'Angleterre a toujours été
l'ami le plus dur à supporter.
Il ne peut s'empêcher d'être capricieux.
Dans ce cas,
je suis certain
de pouvoir compter sur vous
pour mettre en œuvre la bulle.
- Votre Sainteté ?
- Mon enfant,
vous comprenez sans aucun doute
que si j'excommunie un prince,
alors ce dernier
ne sera pas seulement séparé de Dieu,
mais aussi de la communauté des fidèles.
Son règne devient illégal.
Et cela devient un impératif religieux
que de causer sa chute.
Vous êtes un grand prince catholique.
Vous avez des armées,
une flotte et des armes.
Je vous demande donc, en toute humilité,
en tant que Saint-Père...
Envahirez-vous l'Angleterre ?
Renverserez-vous
et tuerez-vous l'apostat ?
Et ramènerez-vous ce pays
à notre religion ?
Les Seymour sont une vieille famille
digne d'intérêt.
Sir John a combattu au côté du Roi
lors de la campagne de France.
Il a également deux fils :
Edward et Thomas.
On m'a dit le premier pondéré et froid,
et le second téméraire.
Mais tous deux sont ambitieux
et cupides.
Bien qu'ils aient tous prêté serment,
nous ignorons s'ils ont
honnêtement et totalement
renoncé à l'ancienne religion.
Espérons que
nous le découvrirons assez tôt.
Et si nous y parvenons ?
Alors, l'avancée de leurs ambitions
pourra être détournée et refluera.
Nous n'entendrons alors
plus parler d'eux.
Son Excellence, l'Ambassadeur impérial.
Votre Éminence,
vous êtes le bienvenu.
Je vous en prie, asseyez-vous.
Vous êtes très aimable,
M. le Secrétaire.
Comme je vous l'ai dit,
Sa Majesté désire plus que tout
s'allier à l'Empereur.
Je crois que le pays profiterait
grandement de cette alliance.
J'en ai débattu avec l'Empereur.
Lui aussi tient à trouver un moyen
de créer une nouvelle et forte alliance.
Et pour montrer sa bonne volonté,
il est prêt à convaincre Sa Sainteté
le Pape Paul,
de ne point publier la sentence
d'excommunication à l'encontre du Roi,
chose qui le priverait de son trône.
Je suis sûr que Sa Majesté
voudra exprimer
son immense gratitude à votre maître.
Et en échange ?
En de telles circonstances,
après la mort de sa tante bien-aimée,
la Reine Catherine d'Angleterre,
l'Empereur est prêt à offrir au Roi
son soutien pour la survivance
de son mariage à Anne Boleyn.
Mais à la condition...
que le Roi... déclare la Princesse Mary
sa légitime héritière.
Je comprends qu'à de...
nombreux égards, ceci est...
une concession très généreuse
de la part de l'Empereur.
Il prie le Roi de comprendre
qu'il ne pourra aller plus loin.
Je présenterai cette proposition
à Sa Majesté.
Avec votre appui ?
Même avec mon appui, Excellence,
ce ne sera pas chose aisée.
- Elle est belle.
- Qui donc ?
Lady Jane Seymour.
Elle est nouvelle à la cour.
Voici.
"S'il te plaît d'être puissant
fuis la rage d'un désir cruel,
"tu verras comme
tu seras libéré du vil joug
"de la servitude sensuelle."
"Le vil joug de la servitude sensuelle,"
cela me sied bien.
C'est que vous ne le comprenez pas,
ni ne comprenez la cruauté
du désir qui l'anime,
jusqu'à voir les fruits
de cette servitude
pendre au bout d'une corde.
- Lady Jane Seymour ?
- Oui.
Pardonnez-moi,
mais il y a quelqu'un ici, un ami,
qui souhaite s'entretenir avec vous.
En privé.
- Quel ami ?
- Par ici, Milady.
Jane.
Votre Majesté.
Je ne vous demanderai
qu'une seule chose :
me permettrez-vous
de vous servir et de vous vénérer
comme Lancelot servit
et vénéra Guenièvre.
Ma douce Dame,
me le permettrez-vous ?
Je vous le permets.
Puis-je baiser votre main ?
Milady...
<i>Les connaissez-vous ?</i>
Connaître qui ?
Les Seymour.
Il se peut que j'aie rencontré Edward,
le fils aîné.
Il est froid comme la pierre.
Je ne sais rien des autres.
Pourquoi vous effrayent-ils ?
Père pense qu'ils soutiennent
peut-être Mary en secret.
Ah, Mary, Mary...
Il est navrant qu'elle
ne tienne pas compagnie à sa mère.
Ils me disent qu'elle est encore malade,
et que le Roi a permis son retrait
du service d'Elizabeth pour sa quiétude.
Ce n'est rien de plus
qu'un geste de bonté.
Non.
Il est fou d'elle.
Il l'a toujours été et l'est encore,
même s'il prétend le contraire
devant moi.
- Est-elle très malade ?
- Beaucoup, d'après ce que je sais.
Elle est fiévreuse et vomit sans cesse.
Alors, avec l'aide à Dieu,
nous n'aurons sans doute pas
à nous en mêler.
Le Roi a proposé de vous servir ?
Oui, Père.
Je n'en suis pas surpris.
Et cela veut dire qu'il ne tend pas
vers une conquête facile.
Il s'est pris d'affection.
Il est important qu'elle soit
soigneusement et assidûment nourrie.
Je vous presse donc
de ne pas vous livrer
et offrir votre virginité au Roi,
quelle que soit
la force de ses arguments.
Jane n'a pas besoin de leçons
de vertu ou de modestie, Edward,
alors qu'elles sont innées chez elle.
Cependant,
imaginez ce que cela impliquerait
pour notre famille,
s'il venait à l'aimer.
Je suis conscient que...
certains à la cour souhaitent
que la Reine soit remplacée.
Attendez !
Je pensais...
Insinuez-vous
que je doive être Reine à sa place ?
Aimeriez-vous l'être ?
Dites-moi, Sir Henry,
vous êtes-vous fiancé
avec Lady Margaret ?
Non, Votre Majesté, je...
Je ne lui ai pas encore demandé sa main.
Pour l'amour de Dieu, mon ami.
Elle est jeune.
Elle...
Elle vous donnera d'autres enfants.
Je le sais.
J'en suis persuadé, Votre Majesté.
Mais...
J'étais marié avant cela et...
je dois avouer que j'aime la liberté
que me procure le célibat.
Je peux comprendre cela.
Savez-vous, Sir Henry ?
Vous courtisez une jeune dame,
et je suis...
Nous devrions jouter à nouveau,
comme nous avions coutume.
Vous avez toujours
fait honneur à la lice.
Nous nous sommes affrontés
à moult occasions,
et avons brisé de nombreuses lances.
Nous devrions recommencer.
Et vous l'organiserez...
bientôt.
Majesté.
Qu'y a-t-il, chérie ?
Où étiez-vous donc ?
Je vous l'ai dit.
J'étais occupé.
Une réunion du Conseil du Roi.
- Jusqu'à cette heure tardive ?
- Oui.
Les affaires du Roi n'attendent pas.
Et qu'en est-il des vôtres ?
Mes affaires ?
Vous revenez d'une autre couche.
Non...
Ne le niez pas.
Parfait, je ne le ferai pas.
Le pire, c'est que
vous n'avez pas renoncé ma couche
pour celle d'une autre femme,
mais pour un autre homme...
Mon Dieu !
Mon Dieu, c'est vrai !
C'est immonde.
C'est un péché...
C'est un péché envers Dieu !
Un péché envers la Nature.
Et ceux qui s'y adonnent
sont condamnés par les évangiles
à vivre pour toujours
dans le purgatoire.
Parfois, mon amour,
j'ai le sentiment qu'avec vous,
je suis déjà condamné au purgatoire !
Le Duc de Suffolk entre en lice
et va affronter le Comte de Dorchester
Pour vous, madame.
Vous avez un bon mari.
<i>Le point est pour le Duc de Suffolk.</i>
<i>Renouvelez vos lances, Messieurs.</i>
Sa Majesté n'a-t-elle pas l'intention
d'assister au tournoi ?
Non. Apparemment, elle craint que
l'émoi qu'engendre le tournoi
ne nuise à son futur garçon.
Ou ce à quoi elle s'attend.
Personnellement,
j'espère qu'elle a changé d'astrologue.
Lady Jane...
Votre Majesté.
Je suis sur le point d'aller jouter.
Puis-je avoir l'honneur
de porter vos faveurs ?
Le point est pour le Duc de Suffolk.
<i>Le Duc de Suffolk remporte la manche.</i>
Sa Majesté le Roi est entré en lice
et s'apprête à jouter, à la plaisance,
contre Sir Henry Norris.
Très bien, Charles.
- C'était parfait, mon amour.
- Merci.
Poussez-vous !
Est-il mort ?
Laissez-nous l'aider.
Vous ne pouvez rien.
Portez-le au pavillon,
avec grands soins,
où je pourrai mieux le soigner.
Et priez pour lui.
- Seymour, Boleyn !
- Votre Grâce.
Qu'y a-t-il, Madge ?
Qu'est-ce qui est arrivé ?
Madge, qu'y a-t-il ?
Le Roi a été blessé
en tombant de son cheval.
Ils...
Ils disent qu'il va certainement mourir.
Mark.
Dites-moi que c'est faux.
Non, pas ça !
Mon Dieu ! Dites-moi que c'est faux !
Son cœur est faible,
j'ignore s'il pourra revenir à lui.
- Ferez-vous une saignée ?
- Je ne pense pas.
Je ne crois pas que cela puisse l'aider.
Sa Majesté est à présent
entre les mains de Dieu.
Confitebimur tibi deus.
Confitebimur et invocabimus nomen tuum.
- Où allons-nous ?
- À Whitehall. Ne comprenez-vous pas ?
Dans une telle crise,
tout pourrait se désagréger.
Le pouvoir doit donc tenir.
Et à nous de le faire tenir.
Une lettre de Douvres, M. le Secrétaire.
M. le Secrétaire !
- Des informations ?
- Aucune.
Le Roi ne donne aucun signe de vie.
- Combien de temps depuis l'accident ?
- Une heure, Votre Honneur.
Confitebimur tibi deus.
Confitebimur et invocabimus nomen tuum.
Narrabimus mirabilia tua.
Cum accepero tempus ego
iustitias iudicabo...
- Que faut-il faire, M. le Secrétaire ?
- Je m'occupe des préparatifs
pour le couronnement de la princesse
Elizabeth avec votre approbation.
Elle est mineure,
mais sera sous la tutelle de sa mère
et vous en tant que Lord Protecteur.
Avez-vous posté un garde
chez Lady Mary
- et fermé les ports ?
- Tout cela est fait.
De même que l'éventualité
d'un urgent rappel du Parlement.
Jadis, les rois n'avaient
nul besoin du Parlement.
Mais ce n'est plus le cas
aujourd'hui, Milord.
Vous savez, j'ignore...
si cela serait une mauvaise chose,
ou une bonne chose, s'il mourait.
Car, en tant que Lord Protecteur,
vous seriez...
ipso facto...
le nouveau Roi d'Angleterre.
Majesté.
Votre Majesté.
Charles.
Dieu merci, il est vivant !
Dieu merci !
Allons, Messieurs, sortez !
Qu'est-ce cela ?
Nous devons nous réjouir que Le Roi
n'ait pas péri lors de sa chute.
Oui, Dieu merci.
Mais cela veut dire
que la venue au monde d'un fils
est plus que nécessaire.
Je vous conjure donc de prendre soin...
de votre personne.
Épargnez-vous tout effort ou excitation.
Tenez-vous à l'écart des gens,
autant que vous pouvez.
J'aurais souhaité exclure Dame Seymour
du cercle de mes suivantes,
mais je n'ose pas.
Cela mettrait le Roi en colère.
C'est de cela que je vous parle !
Si vous vous agitez
pour pareilles futilités,
vos pensées empoisonneront
l'enfant qui est en vous.
Ce ne sont point
des futilités à mes yeux.
Elles le sont, pour l'instant.
Par la suite, lorsque vous concéderez
au Roi son plus grand désir,
vous aurez alors plein pouvoir
pour vous en occuper
tel que vous le souhaitez.
Voyez en moi l'ange...
venu sur Terre vous annoncer
que vous portez l'enfant Jésus,
dans votre ventre.
- Qu'est-ce donc ?
- En raison de la chute,
la vieille blessure de votre jambe
s'est rouverte,
et un ulcère s'y est formé.
- Pouvez-vous le soigner ?
- Très certainement, Votre Majesté.
Il faudra mettre un pansement
et bander la jambe.
Bien que Votre Majesté
soit encore un jeune homme,
vous n'êtes plus aussi jeune
qu'auparavant.
Naguère,
vous pouviez jouter toute la journée
sans en ressentir l'effet...
<i>J'ai un message du Roi pour votre fille,</i>
<i>et seulement pour elle.</i>
Jane.
- Votre Grâce.
- Lady Jane.
Il plaît à Sa Majesté
de vous envoyer cette lettre.
Et cette bourse.
Il vous suggère d'accepter ces présents
dans l'esprit où ils sont offerts.
Je suis ravie que vous vous soyez remis.
J'étais si inquiète et apeurée.
Je l'étais aussi...
quand j'ai compris que ma bêtise
pouvait vous faire perdre l'enfant.
Votre bêtise ?
C'était une erreur de croire
que je pouvais me conduire comme avant.
De toute façon,
ces temps d'insouciance sont révolus.
Notre fille a été amenée à la cour.
Et tout le monde l'a admirée.
Elle sera d'une grande beauté.
Elle le sera certainement.
Comme sa mère.
Demanderez-vous au Roi François
de reconsidérer sa position ?
Si nous tardons à trouver
un bon mari pour Elizabeth,
les gens auront encore plus
motifs à discussion.
Pourquoi parlez-vous d'Elizabeth,
quand Mary n'est pas encore promise ?
Ne devriez-vous pas vous préoccuper
davantage pour votre fille légitime ?
Charles !
Qu'a-t-elle dit ?
Elle a rendu la lettre sans l'ouvrir,
ainsi que la bourse.
Elle dit que son honneur
est son plus grand trésor,
et qu'elle serait ravie
que vous lui offriez cet argent
quand elle aura fait
un mariage honorable.
Elle a agit dans cette affaire
d'une façon pondérée.
Son Excellence, l'Ambassadeur Impérial.
Excellence.
Avez-vous exposé au Roi
la proposition de L'Empereur ?
Pas exactement.
Je souhaite de tout mon cœur
que nous puissions parvenir
à un rapide arrangement.
De toute manière...
quant à la légitimité de Lady Mary,
il persiste un obstacle conséquent.
Vous voulez dire la Reine ?
Je sais qu'étant neveu de Katherine,
elle déteste l'Empereur.
On dit...
que lorsqu'elle a eu connaissance
de sa victoire contre les Turcs
on eut dit un chien,
jeté par la fenêtre.
Que pouvons-nous faire ?
Si un obstacle se trouve
sur notre route, Excellence,
nous devons trouver un moyen
de le contourner.
Lady Jane.
Majesté.
Je vous prie de vous approcher.
Plus près encore.
Ici...
Prenez place sur mes genoux.
Ne craignez rien.
Je respecte votre honneur.
Croyez-moi.
À l'avenir, je ne vous verrai
qu'en présence de votre famille.
Mais je mourrai d'envie de vous voir.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Vos faveurs m'ont sauvé la vie.
- Non...
- Oui !
Gisant là-bas,
votre image m'est venue à l'esprit,
et je me suis réveillé
grâce à cet espoir.
Que dois-je dire ?
Permettez-moi de vous embrasser, Jane ?
Une fois encore.
Oh, Mon Dieu !
Oh, Mon Dieu ! Qu'est-ce donc cela ?
Qu'est-ce cela ?
Alors que mon ventre fait son travail,
je vous surprends à forniquer
avec Dame Seymour.
Ma chérie...
Jane, vous feriez mieux de partir.
Pourquoi me faites-vous cela ?
Pourquoi avez-vous à faire cela ?
- Calmez-vous...
- Non !
Arrêtez !
Deux valets.
Deux reines et... un roi.
Vous gagnez.
- Je devrais voir si elle...
- Non !
Laissez-la dormir.
Qu'y a-t-il, Votre Majesté ?
- L'enfant...
- Mon Dieu !
Mon fils...
Allez chercher de l'aide !
- Pressez-vous !
- Non...
Vous avez perdu mon fils.
Les mots me manquent,
la perte est trop cruelle.
Mais je suis conscient à présent
que Dieu ne m'accordera
aucune descendance masculine !
Quand vous serez remise,
j'aurai à vous parler.
L'erreur ne vient pas que de moi.
Vous ne devez blâmer
personne d'autre que vous.
J'ai été bouleversée en vous voyant
avec cette catin de Jane Seymour.
Car l'amour que je vous porte
est si grand...
mon cœur s'est brisé
à vous voir en aimer une autre.
J'ai dit que j'aurai à vous parler
quand vous serez remise.
Non !
C'est vrai...
... ce qu'ils murmuraient.
J'ai refusé de les écouter,
mais à présent,
je sais que tout est vrai.
J'ai fait ce mariage...
car j'ai été ensorcelé.
Et pour cette raison,
considérez-le comme étant nul
... et non avenu.
Et la preuve en est
que Dieu ne nous accordera
aucune descendance masculine.
À présent, je crois fermement,
de tout mon cœur,
que je vais prendre une autre épouse.

Previously...
Will you ask if Francis won't agree to
the marriage of Elizabeth to his son?
It'll be better for us to pursue
an alliance with the Emperor.
- That would suit Katherine.
- Leave the greater things to my care.
Anyone can see that he isn't
so much in love with her as he used to.
- What's wrong with her?
- Perhaps she's afraid.
So long as they are both alive,
I can't be safe.
- I can just order their deaths!
- You're crazy! Stop it!
You're the Queen of England.
Act like it!
From now on, we must all be careful
not to lose the King's love,
or everything is lost.
Sir John, you have an unexpected guest.
Your Majesty, may I present my daughter,
Lady Jane Seymour?
The hours of my death draws fast on,
and I commend unto you
our daughter Mary.
beseeching you to be a good father.
Now I'm indeed Queen.
The King of England has been carried
far from the shore,
but he does not know it.
He thinks he can swim alone.
Very soon, he will realize
he is not swimming, but drowning.
Have you told her about me?
Why the hell not?
If you'd read Greek, you would know that
even gods had problems with their wives.
You are determined to close
every religious house in England.
You are far too high-handed.
You ought to be careful,
or I'll have you cropped at the neck.
I did not bring you up to quarrel
- with those closest to the Crown.
- I'm the King's wife.
And you should remember
how you got there!
He fell in love with me.
He respected me.
Jane should come to court
as Lady to Her Majesty.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I am carrying
the King's son.
We are on the edge of a golden world!

Thank you, Edward.
Sister.
- Lady Jane?
- Yes.
Her Majesty is just coming.
You are not to speak anything to her
until you are invited to.
Yes.
Your Majesty...
Mistress Seymour, will you place
your hand upon this Holy Bible...
And will you promise and swear
to serve Her Majesty Queen Anne
faithfully, honorably and discreetly.
And will you promise and swear
that your conduct will always be modest,
virtuous and good,
presenting at all times
a godly spectacle to others?
I do so promise and swear.
Lady Jane.
Your Majesty.
The King.
Your Majesty...
Mr. Secretary.
I managed with some difficulty
to obtain a copy
of the secret report
of the autopsy on Katherine.
- What was discovered?
- That the internal organs were normal,
except for the heart,
which had a black growth,
all hideous to behold,
which clung closely to the outside.
What could have caused it?
Her doctor, who I trust completely,
told me that such a growth
was consistent
with the evidence of poisoning.
Had the body been properly examined,
traces of it would have been seen.
Poor Katherine.
There is little need to pray for her.
Her holy soul is in eternal rest.
But... I worry for her daughter.
Poor Mary.
We shall talk later.
Excellency.
Your Majesty.
I hear your master
is to be congratulated.
He has taken Tunis from the Turks.
Your Majesty is very well informed.
The threat of the Turkish invasion
has indeed been lifted
by the Emperor's victory.
Peace will follow.
Would it follow everywhere?
Yes, pray God.
Perhaps one day
there will be no more need for war,
or wars alarms.
In the meantime,
please convey my love
and my congratulations to the Emperor.
Tell him that...
Tell him that,
of all the princes in the world,
I admire him the most.
Cromwell!
Now the Emperor has defeated the Turks,
his armies are free to turn upon us.
and a while ago,
I swear he would have done so.
But no longer.
With Katherine's death the cause
of our enmity is altogether taken away.
And I have a new desire
to renew my friendship with him.
You will talk to Chapuys.
You will find out
the cost of friendship.
Yes, Your Majesty.
What of our reforms?
The Bill for the dissolution
of the larger monasteries
will be laid before Parliament
at the next session.
Mr. Cromwell.
Majesty.
There was something else.
I understand you have a wife and son.
Yes.
What's your son's name?
Gregory.
I had two daughters also. But...
... they died.
You will bring
your wife and son to court.
I should like to meet them.
Yes, Majesty.
Your Majesty.
If Your Majesty will follow me.
Good people,
Welcome.
Here is the Queen's Majesty come,
this Maundy Thursday,
to give you alms and wash your feet,
God bless you!
God keep you!
God in his mercy bless you and keep you.
Will you look! This is twice as much
as the old Queen gave!
God bless you.
Holiness, His Royal Highness,
the King of France
Majesty.
You come to us
as a pilgrim and a penitent.
Surely you deserve heaven's graces.
With all my heart,
I welcome you to Rome...
... the Mother of our Church,
When others fall by the wayside,
through vanity, avarice or lust...
you remain loyal to us,
and to the truth of Christ.
As a child to a father,
I say to you here, in the presence
of all these princes of our Holy Church,
that I would gladly lay down my life
in order to serve you,
and in whatever way you choose.
I have decided to carry out
the Bull of Excommunication
against King Henry of England.
A father must always seek for ways
to forgive his children,
but Henry's crimes against us
and against our faith
are too profound to forgive.
Moreover,
he shows no repentance,
no contrition.
It's true.
The King of England has always been
the most difficult
friend to bear in the world.
He is continuously capricious.
In which case,
I am sure I can rely upon you
to execute the Bull.
- Holiness?
- My son,
surely you realize,
if I excommunicate a fellow prince,
then that prince is not only
separated from God...
but also from
the communion of the faithful.
His rule becomes invalid.
And it is a religious imperative
to overthrow him.
You are a great Catholic Prince.
You have armies.
You have ships. You have guns.
So I ask you, in all humility,
as your Holy Father...
Will you invade England?
Will you remove and kill the apostate
and will you return that country
to our common faith?
The Seymours are
an old and interesting family.
Sir John fought beside the King
during his French campaign.
He also has two sons:
Edward and Thomas.
I hear the first is steady and cold,
the other rash.
But both are ambitious,
and greedy.
Though they have all taken the oath,
what is not yet known is
how honestly or completely
they have renounced the old religion.
It is something we must hope,
before long, to discover.
And if we can?
Then,
the tide of their ambitions
can be turned, and will ebb away,
and we shall hear no more of them.
His Excellency, the Imperial Ambassador.
Your Eminency.
You are most welcome.
Please be seated.
You are most gracious, Mr. Secretary.
As I told you,
His Majesty is most desirous
to make an alliance with the Emperor.
I believe also that such an alliance
would be greatly
to the benefit of this country.
I have communicated with the Emperor.
He, also, is eager to find a way
to make a new and strong alliance.
And to show his good will,
I can tell you that he is willing
to persuade His Holiness,
Pope Paul, not to publish the sentence
of excommunication against the King,
which would have
deprived him of his throne.
I am sure His Majesty
would wish to express
his immense gratitude to your master.
And in return?
In the circumstances,
after the death of his beloved aunt,
Queen Katherine of England,
the Emperor is prepared
to offer the King his support
for the continuation
of his marriage to Anne Boleyn.
But on condition
that the King... declares Princess Mary
to be his legitimate heir.
I accept this is, in many ways,
a most generous concession
on behalf of the Emperor.
He begs the King to understand
it is as far as he is prepared to go.
I will certainly put your proposal
to His Majesty.
With your approval?
Even with my approval, Excellency,
this may not be easy.
- She's pretty.
- Who?
Lady Jane Seymour.
She's new at court.
Here.
"If thou wilt mighty be,
flee from the rage of cruel will,
and see thou keep thee free
from the foul yoke of sensual bondage."
"The foul yoke of sensual bondage".
I like that!
Then you don't understand it
or how cruel the will that drives it.
Until you see the fruits
of sensual bondage
swinging from a rope.
- Lady Jane Seymour?
- Yes.
Forgive me, for there is someone
over here, a friend,
who wishes a word with you.
In private.
Which friend?
This way, my Lady.
Jane.
Your Majesty.
I ask you only one thing:
that you allow me
to serve and worship you.
As Lancelot served
and worshipped Guinevere.
Sweet gentle Lady,
will you let me so?
I will.
May I kiss your hand?
My Lady.
Do you know them?
Who? Know who?
The Seymours.
I may have met Edward, the eldest son.
He's a cold fish.
I don't know about the others.
Are you afraid of them?
Father thinks they may be
secret supporters of Mary.
Ah, Mary, Mary...
It's a pity she's not keeping company
with her mother.
They tell me she is ill again,
and that the King has given permission
for her removal
from Elizabeth's household,
for her comfort.
It's an act of kindness.
No more than that.
No. He's fond of her.
He always was and he still is,
though he pretends
differently to my face.
How ill is she?
Very. So I am told.
With a fever and constant vomiting.
Then, with God's good grace,
we may not have
to meddle with her after all.
The King has offered to serve you?
Yes, father.
I am not surprised.
And it means he does not seek
an easy conquest.
He has formed an affection.
What's important is that it should be
carefully and assiduously nurtured.
I must urge you not to submit yourself
and yield your virginity to the King,
however forceful his persuasions is.
Jane does not need to be lectured
on the need for virtue or modesty,
when she possesses them in her nature.
Still,
imagine what it would
mean for us, as a family,
if he did grow to love her.
I am certainly aware there are
some at court who would like
to see the Queen replaced.
Wait!
I thought...
Are you saying that I should be
Queen instead of her?
Would you like to be?
Tell me, Sir Henry,
are you engaged yet to Lady Margaret?
No, Your Majesty. I am...
I have not so far asked for her hand.
For God's sake, man!
She's young.
She's...
She will give you more children,
I know it.
And I know it, Your Majesty. But...
I was married before and,
I must confess,
I rather like the liberty
of not being married again.
That I can understand.
You know what, Sir Henry?
You're courting a young lady
and I'm...
We should joust together again,
as we used to.
You always did grace the tiltyard.
We ran many courses against each other
and broke many lances.
We should do it again...
and you can organize it.
Soon.
Majesty.
Ah, sweetheart! What is it?
Where have you been?
I told you.
I had meetings.
Privy Council matters.
- Until this hour?
- Yes.
The King's affairs never sleep.
And what of your affairs?
My affairs?
You have just come from another's bed.
No...
Do not deny it!
Very well. I shan't.
What makes it worse
is that you have not forsaken
my bed for that of another woman,
but for another man.
Oh God! Oh my God!
Oh my God! It's true!
Oh, my God!
It's disgusting!
It's a sin.
It's a sin against God.
A sin against nature.
And those who practice it
are condemned by the Gospels
to live forever in purgatory.
Sometimes, my love,
I think that with you...
I'm already condemned
to live in purgatory!
For you, my lady.
You have fine husband.
Point for the Duke of Suffolk.
Gentlemen, renew your lances
Is Her Majesty not attending
the tournament today?
No. Apparently she's worried
that the excitements of the tournament
might harm her unborn son.
Or so she supposes it to be.
Personally, I hope she did not
visit the same astrologer as before.
Lady Jane...
Your Majesty.
I am about to go and joust.
Would you do me the honor
of allowing me to wear your favors?
A point to the Duke of Suffolk.
Match come to the Duke of Suffolk.
His Majesty the King
has entered the list
and will now joust, ŕ la plaisance,
with Sir Henry Norris.
Well done, Charles.
- Well done, my love.
- Thank you.
Move, move!
Is he dead, is he dead?
Let others help him. You can't.
Take him with all care
into the pavilion,
where I may serve him better.
And pray for him.
- Seymour! Boleyn!
- Your Grace.
Madam! Oh Madam!
Madge. What is it? What's happened?
- Madge, what's happened?
- Oh, Madam,
the King has fallen from his horse
and has been crushed.
They...
they say he is likely to die.
Mark...
Say it is not so.
Please no!
Oh God! Please, say it is not so...
His heart is very weak.
I don't know if he will come back to us.
- Will you bleed him?
- I don't think so, your Grace.
I do not see it would help him.
His Majesty
is now in the hands of God.
Confitebimur tibi deus.
Confitebimur et invocabimus nomen tuum.
- Where are we going?
- Back to Whitehall.
Don't you understand anything?
In such a crisis,
all could disintegrate.
So the centre has to hold.
And we must hold it.
Mr. Secretary. A letter from Dover, Sir.
Mr. Secretary...
- News?
- There is no news.
The King still shows no signs of life.
- How long since the accident?
- Almost an hour ago, Your Honor.
Confitebimur tibi deus.
Confitebimur et invocabimus nomen tuum.
Narrabimus mirabilia tua.
Cum accepero tempus
ego iustitias iudicabo...
What is to be done?
I'm making preparations,
in the event of the King's death,
for the coronation of the Princess
Elizabeth with your lordship's approval.
She would be in a minority,
but under the worship of her mother and
with yourself as Lord Protector.
And have you posted a guard
on my Lady Mary? And closed the ports?
All that is in hand.
As are preparations
for an emergency recall of Parliament.
King's had no need
of parliament in the old days!
These are not the old days, my Lord.
You know, I cannot think,
whether it would be a bad thing,
or a good thing, if he died.
For, as Lord Protector, you would,
ipso facto,
be King of England.
Your Majesty?
Charles.
Oh thank God. He's alive!
Come on gentlemen, out, out!
What's that?
We must be grateful that his Majesty
took no hurt in his fall.
Yes, thank God.
But it means that the safe production
of a son from your womb
is more than ever imperative.
So I beg you to be always careful
with yourself.
Take no exertions or excitements.
Shut yourself away
as much as you can from the world.
I wish there was a way I could remove
Mistress Seymour from among my ladies.
But I dare not.
I think it would anger the King.
This is what I mean.
If you fret about such little matters
then your thoughts
may poison the child inside you.
It is not a little matter to me.
It is for now.
Afterwards,
when you have given
the King his great desire,
then you will have
all the power to deal with her
as you like.
Think that I am the angel
come down to tell you
that you carry the Christ child
in your belly.
- What is it?
- Because of the fall
this old wound
on your leg has re-opened,
and an ulcer has formed.
- Can you heal it?
- Most certainly, Majesty.
But for now you must wear a dressing
and have the leg bound up.
Though Your Majesty
is still a young man,
you are not as young as used to.
In those days,
you could joust a whole day
and not feel the effect...
<i>I have a message from the King
for your daughter,</i>
<i>and for her ears alone.</i>
Ah! Jane.
- Your Grace.
- Lady Jane.
His Majesty is pleased
to send you this letter.
And this purse.
He commends you to accept these gifts
in the spirit in which they're offered.
I am so happy you're well.
I was so alarmed, so afraid.
So was I...
when I thought that through
my foolishness you might lose the child.
Your foolishness?
It was a mistake to think
I could behave as I used to.
In any case,
those carefree days are gone.
Our daughter was brought to court.
And everyone admired her.
I think she will be a great beauty.
Of course she will.
Look at her mother.
Will you not ask King Francis
to reconsider his refusal?
If we delay much longer
to find a good marriage for Elizabeth,
people will talk,
even more than they do already.
Why do you talk of Elizabeth,
when Mary is not yet betrothed.
Surely you have more of a care
for your legitimate daughter?
Charles!
What did she say?
She returned the letter unopened,
and the purse both.
She said that she has no greater
treasure in this world than her honor,
and that if you want to give her money,
she praise you might do so
when she has made an honorable marriage.
She has behaved herself
in this matter most modestly.
His Excellency the Imperial Ambassador.
Excellency.
I wondered if you had put
the Emperor's proposal to the King?
Not exactly.
I wish with all my heart
that we could reach
a speedy accommodation. However,
in the question
of legitimizing the Lady Mary,
there remains one great obstacle.
You mean the Queen?
I know she hates the Emperor
as Katherine's nephew.
They say
that when she was told
of his victory over the Turks,
she looked like a dog
being thrown out of a window.
But what can we do?
If there is an obstacle
in our path, Excellency,
we must find a way around it.
Lady Jane.
Majesty.
I pray you come closer.
Closer still.
Here...
sit on my knee.
Don't be afraid.
I respect your honor,
believe me.
In the future, I will not see you unless
your other family members are present.
I just had to see you now.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your favor saved my life.
- No...
- Yes!
As I lay there, your image came to me,
and I awoke with this promise.
What should I say?
Will you let me kiss you, Jane?
Once more.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! What is this?
What is this?
Just when my belly
is doing its business,
I find you wenching
with Mistress Seymour.
Sweetheart.
Jane, you had best leave.
Why are you doing this?
Why did you have to do this?
Peace...
Stop it!
Two knaves...
Two queens and a king.
You win.
Do you think I should go and see...
Let her sleep.
What is, Your Majesty?
- The baby...
- My God!
My boy!
Get some help.
- Hurry.
- No... no...
You have lost my boy.
I cannot speak of it,
the loss is too great,
but I see now
that God will not grant me
any male children.
When you are up,
I will speak with you.
It is not all my fault.
You have no one to blame
but yourself for this.
I was distressed to see you
with that wench Jane Seymour.
Because the love I bear you
is so great.
It broke my heart
to see you loved others.
I said I will speak with you
when you are well.
It's true...
what they have whispered.
I shut my ears to them,
but now I know it to be true.
I made this marriage
seduced by witchcraft.
And for that reason
consider it to be null
and void.
And the evidence is that God
will not permit us
male issue...
so now I believe,
with all my heart,
that I will take another wife.

Dans les épisodes précédant...
Jane, votre fille, devrait venir ŕ la Cour
comme Dame de compagnie de la Reine
Imagine ce que ça signifie pour nous,
si on le pousse ŕ l'aimer.
Certains ŕ la Cour aimeraient
voir la Reine remplacée.
Ętes-vous en train de dire
que je pourrais ętre Reine ?
J'aimerais me séparer de la Dame Seymour.
Quand tu auras satisfait
la plus grande attente du Roi,
Tu auras tous les moyens de faire
ce que tu voudras.
Je désire renouveler mon amitié
avec l'Empereur.
Trouvez-en le coűt.
L'Empereur est pręt ŕ soutenir le Roi,
ŕ condition qu'il désigne la Princesse Mary
comme son héritičre légitime.
Il reste un obstacle
qu'il nous faut contourner.
Il a été séduit par sorcellerie,
je l'ai toujours cru.
- Mon Dieu !
- C'est pourquoi elle doit mourir.
Tu as délaissé mon lit
pour celui d'un homme.
Il se passe quelque chose.
Tout va bien.
Le Roi est tombé de cheval et a été écrasé.
Il est pratiquement mort.
Votre image m'est apparue quand je gisais.
Puis-je vous embrasser, Jane ?
Mon Dieu ! Que se passe-t-il ?
Alors que je porte votre enfant
vous batifolez avec la jeune Seymour.
Vous avez perdu mon fils.
Je comprends maintenant que Dieu
ne m'accordera pas d'enfant mâle.
Vous ne pouvez vous en prendre
qu'ŕ vous męme.
Le mariage c'est fait par sorcellerie.
C'est pourquoi je le considčre
comme nul et sans objet.
Aussi, maintenant, je crois
que je dois prendre une autre femme.
Adaptation française et synchronisation
SMC.
L'enfant était un mâle,
d'environ quatre mois.
Cependant,
le fétus
avait des déformations,
des anormalités.
Peut-ętre, aprčs tout
la fausse couche de la Reine
était-elle, en fait, une bénédiction.
Je vous en prie,
il faut que le Roi François accepte
le mariage de son fils avec Élisabeth
pour que je ne perde pas tout,
ce que je crains tout proche,
car je suis dans une peine et un trouble
plus grands męme qu'avant mon mariage.
Je ne peux en dire plus
ni coucher sur le papier mes peurs,
Mais, s'il vous plait,
aprčs tout ce que j'ai fait pour la France,
si vous m'aimez, faites de votre mieux
pour l'Amour de Dieu.
Nous ne nous connaissons pas bien,
mais nous allons le faire.
Je n'en doute pas.
C'est la volonté du Roi
de vous nommer Membre de la Chambre Privée.
A ce titre, vous verrez le Roi chaque jour
et autant qu'il souhaitera vous utiliser.
C'est, vous le comprendrez,
une situation spéciale et privilégiée.
Je le comprends parfaitement.
Et j'en suis trčs honoré, M. Le Secrétaire.
Encore une chose,
Sa majesté m'a indiqué
qu'il souhaiterait, de temps ŕ autre,
courtiser votre fille.
Mais, pour éviter tout scandale
l'impliquant avec votre fille,
ce sera en présence
d'un membre de votre famille.
Dans cette optique, je suis trčs heureux
de vous offrir
mes appartements privés au Palais.
Il se trouve qu'ils communiquent
avec les appartements du Roi
par un couloir des plus discrets.
Vous ętes des plus généreux,
M. le Secrétaire
Je suis sűr que mon pčre aimera
vous rendre la pareille.
Vous avez donné vos appartements
aux Seymour ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Crétin.
Nous venons de donnera notre consentement
royal ŕ l'acte de démantčlement
de l'évęché de Norwich, ŕ Lynn.
Le nouveau bénéficiaire doit ętre
Thomas Boleyn, comte du Wiltshire.
Je prévois également de lui donner
deux des abbayes dissoutes.
Vous devez l'informer de sa bonne fortune.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Personne ne doit connaître
nos plans, M. Cromwell.
Viens ici, Jane.
Laisse-moi te regarder.
Tu es magnifique.
Pręte ?
Devons-nous le faire ?
J'ai quelque chose pour vous.
Ouvrez-le.
Merci.
Je le garderais toute ma vie.
Et si, un jour, on ouvre ma tombe,
on le trouvera
tout prčs de mon cśur.
Je me demande pourquoi, aprčs tout
ce temps, il n'épouse pas Madge ?
Je pense que Norris vient ici
plus pour vous que pour Madge.
Pour moi ?
Les appartements de Cromwell ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Un médaillon, Votre Majesté.
Montrez le moi.
Montrez le moi.
J'ai de bonnes nouvelles
pour Votre Majesté.
L'acte de Dissolution des Monastčres
vient de passer au Parlement.
Notre reforme se développe.
On m'a dit que le Roi a déjŕ vendu
L'abbaye de Sawley dans le Yorkshire
ŕ un de ses Courtisans.
quant bien męme l'Acte
n'est pas encore enregistré
et ce, sur votre conseil insistant.
Notre Reforme n'avait pas pour but
les gains personnels.
Les établissements religieux
ne devraient pas ętre vendus
mais transformés pour un meilleur usage.
Les biens confisqués
seront affectés ŕ la discrétion de Dieu
et au profit de ce royaume.
aujourd'hui petit mais qui, un jour,
dépassera męme l'Espagne.
Ainsi, vous avez donné vos appartements
aux Seymour ?
Je suis la Reine d'Angleterre, vous allez
me répondre. Est-ce vrai ?
Oui, c'est vrai.
Vous ętes allé trop loin, M. Cromwell.
Croyez-moi, vous vous ętes mis
en trčs danger.
Vous me croyez ?
Ou considérez-vous que je n'ai plus
le pouvoir de vous écraser ?
Ce serait une erreur facile ŕ faire,
M. Cromwell.
J'ai pensé que vous aimeriez
récupérer ceci.
Merci.
Bonsoir Excellence.
Puis-je vous débarrasser ?
Son Excellence, l'Ambassadeur Impérial.
Eustace !
C'est si gentil de venir
jusqu'ŕ Shoreditch.
Croyez-moi, j'irai beaucoup plus loin,
M. le Secrétaire,
pour le plaisir de parler avec vous.
Puis-je ętre direct ?
Est-il vrai que vous vous ętes...
heurtés avec la Reine Anne ?
Je crois qu'elle me hait.
Elle veut me voir exécuté.
Vous n'avez pas peur ?
J'ai si confiance en mon Maître
que j'aime ŕ penser
qu'elle ne peut pas m'atteindre.
Quoi qu'il en soit, je ne peux que
vous souhaiter une maîtresse plus aimable,
plus reconnaissante pour...
les services que vous avez rendus au Roi.
Pour la beauté du raisonnement,
supposons que le Roi...
envisage...
de prendre une autre femme ?
Ce serait tout ŕ son avantage.
Car voici un Roi en mal de descendance mâle
qui sait trčs bien que son mariage actuel
ne sera jamais légitimé.
Le Roi vous réclame ŕ la Cour.
Je suis certain qu'il souhaite confirmer
la nouvelle alliance avec l'Empereur.
Je ne vois pas
ce que ce pourrait ętre d'autre.
Alors je suis impatient de le découvrir,
M. le Secrétaire
Que puis-je pour vous ?
Vous pourriez demander ŕ votre frčre
d'ętre gentil avec moi.
Il est cruel en tous points.
Allons, je ne vous crois pas.
Il en a choisi d'autres que moi.
Vous ne comprenez pas.
Il ne me traite pas comme son épouse,
au contraire du Roi avec vous.
Laissez-moi vous dire quelque chose,
Lady Rochford.
Le Roi ne peut pas satisfaire une femme.
Il n'en a ni l'habileté ni la virilité.
Nous devons renoncer ŕ l'idée
de alliance avec la France
Le Roi semble implacablement contre.
Il semble de plus en plus s'orienter vers
une nouvelle alliance avec l'Empereur.
Tu m'écoutes ?
Oui, Pčre.
Le pays semble également préférer
l'alliance avec l'empereur.
Alors, ça ne sert ŕ rien de lutter
contre les moulins.
L'Ambassadeur Impérial
va ętre reçu ŕ la Cour.
Tu vas t'en servir.
D'abord, en l'invitant ŕ t'embrasser,
Puis le Roi et toi allez déjeuner avec lui,
et tu diras quelques méchancetés
contre les Français
devant les autres ambassadeurs.
Dis qu'ils ont trahi votre confiance,
que ce sont des faux amis hypocrites,
męme si tu ne le penses pas.
Oui, Pčre.
Nous sommes arrivés de si loin.
Personne n'aura le droit
de nous détruire.
Personne !
Tu comprends ?
Je comprends
Son Excellence, l'Ambassadeur Impérial.
Jésus.
Leurs Gracieuses Majestés.
M. Chapuys déjeune surement avec nous
aprčs la Messe ?
Mais il est parti !
Pas sans de bonnes raisons.
Il se passe quelque chose, Mark.
Mais je ne sais pas quoi.
Éminence,
Je sais qu'il y a eu, dans le passé,
des malentendus
entre ma famille et vous.
Quelques mots excessifs
qui n'auraient pas du ętre prononcés
et qu'on regrette maintenant.
Mais nous vivons dans la vraie vie,
il faut prendre nos amis tels qu'ils sont.
Je sais que l'Empereur veut protéger
ses liens commerciaux avec l'Angleterre.
Il est évident que ma famille est
en situation de l'aider
et que nous sommes décidés ŕ le faire.
Alors, portons un toast
ŕ ce nouveau départ,
ŕ notre nouvelle amitié
et ŕ un futur mutuellement fructueux.
D'oů ętes-vous, Excellence ?
Je suis le fier ambassadeur
de Milan, Madame
Ah, Milan...
Vous avez été occupés par les Français ?
Hélas, les troupes françaises
sont toujours lŕ.
Vous serez d'accord avec moi, alors, pour
dire qu'en tout les Français sont décevants
En fait, quelqu'un ici peut-il dire
que les Français sont autre chose que
des hypocrites et des menteurs.
Sont-ils toujours francs ?
Combien de traités honorés,
combien de promesses tenues ?
M. Cromwell, que va-t-il se passer ?
Sa Majesté va bientôt
donner audience ŕ l'Ambassadeur
C'est ce que nous attendons.
Votre Excellence,
Suivez-moi.
Pardonnez-moi.
On me dit que votre Maître est impatient
pour l'alliance.
Il l'est, Votre Majesté.
Dans quels termes ?
Ceux que nous a soumis M. Cromwell.
La reprise des relations entre
l'Angleterre et Rome,
L'inscription de Lady Mary dans
la ligne de succession,
et le soutien ŕ l'Empereur dans sa guerre
contre la France pour Milan.
Pour ce qui concerne Lady Mary,
il se peut que Dieu ne vous ai pas envoyé
de descendance mâle
parce qu'il pense que
l'Angleterre devrait avoir
une succession féminine.
Que sous-entendez-vous, Excellence ?
Que je ne suis pas un homme
comme les autres ?
C'est ça ?
C'est ça ?
Vous ne connaissez pas tous mes secrets.
Je veux tout par écrit,
toute la proposition de l'Empereur.
C'es impossible, Votre Majesté.
Vous me prenez pour un enfant
qu'on gronde puis qu'on console ?
Si votre Maître veut traiter avec moi,
il doit d'abord s'excuser
pour tout ce qu'il m'a fait subir
par le passé.
Il doit accepter la Reine Anne.
Je n'ai rien d'autre ŕ dire ŕ votre Maître.
Les Princes ne sont pas comme nous,
et pas trčs faciles ŕ comprendre.
Messieurs.
Je suis votre plus vieil ami
et votre plus loyal sujet
c'est pourquoi je pense que
c'est mon devoir, douloureux,
de porter ŕ votre connaissance
quelques vérités.
"Vérité", disait Pilate en plaisantant
Quelle est la vérité ?
Des rumeurs sur le comportement de la Reine
prétendent
qu'elle distrait des hommes
dans ses appartements
flirte
et partage son intimité avec eux...
Mes Seigneurs, ce Royaume
est en péril et en danger.
Mais pas du fait de nos ennemis
ou d'étrangers diaboliques
On a porté ŕ ma connaissance que
des actes de trahison
et d'autres offenses.
ont été commis par certains ŕ qui nous
offrions amour et confiance,
des membres de notre propre Cour.
M. Rich,
en tant que Procureur Général,
je vous désigne, vous et M. Cromwell,
pour conduire une commission d'enquęte
afin d'établir si ces offenses
sont avérées.
Bonne journée, Messieurs.
Lady Sheldon,
Je vous engage ŕ ne répéter ŕ quiconque
ce qui se passe aujourd'hui entre nous.
Vous vivez dans l'intimité
de Sa Majesté la Reine.
Ne l'avez vous jamais vu se distraire
avec des hommes
dans des conditions
que vous pourriez considérer
comme inappropriées ?
Vous en ętes sűre ?
Je dois vous avertir, Madame,
que cacher la vérité aux enquęteurs du Roi
c'est se rendre coupable de trahison,
qui est punie par la pendaison.
J'ai de bonnes raisons de vous demander
de quitter Whitehall pour un temps.
Retournez chez votre pčre.
Je vais partir.
Je ferais, bien sur, tout ce que
Votre Majesté me demandera.
Je veux vous dire...
en ce monde incertain,
vous représentez pour moi l'innocence,
tout ce qui est bon,
immaculé,
non corrompu
Ce ne sera pas long.
Et ensuite...
Nous pourrons satisfaire
les désirs de nos cśurs.
Allez.
Vous en ętes certaine ?
Allez !
Il est vrai que certains hommes
venaient dans les appartements de la Reine
ŕ des heures indues.
Et parfois elle flirtait avec eux, mais...
Leurs noms ?
Lord Rochford, bien sűr.
Et ?
Et Sir Henry Norris...
Et ?
Le valet du Roi, Brereton...
Et ?
Mark Smeaton, le musicien...
Et ?
Et ?
Je l'ai vu étreindre
et embrasser son frčre.
Son frčre ?
Mais je n'en ai rien déduit...
Vous croyez que c'est vrai ?
Oui, je crois que c'est vrai.
Vous pensez que votre mari
a commis l'inceste avec la Reine ?
Que me vaut ce grand plaisir ?
Du calme M. Smeaton.
Que faites-vous ?
Je veux savoir quand et combien de fois
vous avez couché avec la Reine.
Je n'ai jamais couché avec la Reine.
Je n'ai jamais couché avec la Reine.
Je ne comprends pas, M. Cromwell.
Vous devez dire la vérité.
Je veux la vérité
ou ça va mal se passer pour vous.
Je jure sur la tęte de Dieu
que je n'ai jamais couché avec la Reine.
Ne me faites pas mal.
Vous n'ętes qu'un pauvre musicien
et vous avez récemment dépensé beaucoup
en écuries et chevaux pour vos gens !
D'oů venait cet argent ?
C'était pour des services rendus.
Je jure sur la tęte de Dieu
que je n'ai jamais couché avec la Reine.
On y va, et...
Plus vite maintenant...
Un, deux, trois, quatre...
Ah, Lady Sheldon!
Je crois que vous savez ce que vous faites.
Le bras gauche
en l'air, en bas, on saute...
Continuez.
Votre visite en France avec le Roi
est différée.
Pourquoi ?
Il y a autre chose...
Mark Smeaton a été arręté.
Quel motif ?
On  ne sait pas encore.
Je dois y aller.
Sir Henry, encore vous !
Aurez-vous un jour
le courage de l'épouser ?
Il ne faut jamais précipiter un mariage.
Non, je connais la vérité.
Vous voulez dépouiller les morts.
Je me dois de protester.
Je crois que s’il arrive malheur au Roi,
vous pensez pouvoir m'avoir.
Madame, si j'avais de telles pensées,
je souhaiterai qu'on me coupe la tęte.
On peut arranger ça.
Faites moi amener Élisabeth demain.
Je veux voir ma fille.
S’il m'arrive quoi que ce soit,
Promettez-moi de prendre soin d'elle.
Tôt ou tard, vous nous direz la vérité,
M. Smeaton.
Alors ?
C'est faux.
Comment ?
C'est faux.
Le Roi a convoqué un Conseil d'urgence.
Pourquoi ne suis-je pas informé ?
Parce que je ne le suis pas non plus !
Pour l'amour de Dieu,
ne perdez pas le Roi de vue.
Mr. Cromwell arrive.
Smeaton a avoué.
Venez avec moi.
Saviez vous que la Reine est
ŕ nouveau enceinte ?
Non, comment l'aurais-je su ?
Parce que vous ętes peut-ętre le pčre...
puisque vous l'aimez si bien,
comme beaucoup l'ont rapporté.
Votre majesté est ridicule.
Ainsi, vous me trouvez ridicule ?
Gardes !
Arrętez-le.
Emmenez-le ŕ la Tour.
Sur ordre du Roi, vous ętes arręté
pour Haute Trahison.
Oů allez-vous ?
Il faut que je vois le Roi.
C'est trop tard, George,
beaucoup trop tard.
Mon Seigneur, Sir Thomas, vous ętes
tous les deux arrętés pour Haute Trahison,
et connaissance charnelle
de Sa Majesté la Reine
Quoi ?
Henry, s'il vous plait.
Pour l'amour de notre enfant,
Pour l'amour d'Élisabeth...
Vous m'avez menti.
Vous m'avez toujours menti.
Vous n'étiez pas vierge ŕ notre mariage.
Vous n'étiez pas celle
que vous sembliez ętre
Votre pčre et votre frčre ont
tout manigancé.
Non, je vous aimais...
Je vous aimais
et je vous aime toujours.
Aprčs tout ce que nous avons été
l'un pour l'autre,
Aprčs tout ce que nous étions,
je vous en prie.
Une derničre chance...
Une derničre...
Votre Majesté, je vous implore.
Vous savez pourquoi vous avez été arręté.
Non seulement vous avez pratiqué le vil
inceste avec votre sśur, la Reine
Sa langue dans votre bouche,
la votre dans la sienne,
contre tous les commandements de Dieu...
Mais au surplus vous avez ourdi
un régicide,
ainsi Anne aurait pu épouser un de ses
amants et assurer la Régence de son bâtard.
Vous me déroutez.
Mes ennemis en empoisonné l'air
de leurs mensonges horribles.
Quoique ma soeur ai fait, ce n'était pas
avec moi, ni de mon fait.
Je suis innocent, M. Cromwell.
Je vous le jure.
Je le jure sur le sang du Christ.
Je suis innocent.
Bien sur.
Dites-moi, M. Brereton
Avez-vous connu charnellement
Sa Majesté la Reine ?
Oui, je l'ai fait.
Je les condamne totalement.
Tous ces hommes, quelque soit
leur rang ou leur position
quelque soit leur rang
ou leur position, qui...
ont trompé le Roi et se sont glissés
dans le lit son épouse légitime.
Je ne peux pas...
Totalement.
Pour un tel
terrible adultčre
il ne peut y avoir qu'une punition.
Messieurs, pourquoi ętes vous lŕ ?
Voici votre ordre d'arrestation.
Vous ętes inculpée d'adultčre
avec Mark Smeaton,
Sir Henry Norris et William Brereton.
Smeaton and Brereton
ont déjŕ avoué leur crime.
Sur les ordres du Roi,
nous vous conduisons ŕ la Tour
pour y rester tant qu'il plaira
ŕ Sa Majesté.
S'il s'agit du plaisir du Roi,
je suis pręte ŕ obéir.
Vous n'avez ni le temps de vous changer
ni celui de prendre un bagage.
On vous donnera de l'argent ŕ la Tour
pour vos besoins.
Avant de partir, Mes Seigneurs,
je vous demande
d'implorer la grâce du Roi
pour ętre bon avec moi.
Madame, par ici, je vous prie.
J'implore l'aide de Dieu
car toutes ces allégations sont fausses.
Par ici.
Je suis la vraie épouse du Roi.
Je ne suis pas coupable.
Je suis aussi éloignée de la compagnie
des hommes que de celle du péché.
Je vais au donjon, M. Kingston ?
Non, Madame.
Il y a des logements préparés pour vous.
C'est trop bien pour moi.
Jésus a pitié de moi.
Merci.
Puis-je avoir les Saints Sacrements dans
ma chambre pour prier pour mon salut ?
Votre Grace.
Votre Grace ?
Je viens d'apprendre
l'arrestation de la Reine.
Je suis stupéfait.
Je ne peux pas croire qu'elle soit
coupable de telles abominations.
Pourtant, je ne peux pas imaginer
que le Roi aurait été aussi loin
sans qu'elle soit coupable.
Le Roi et moi-męme avons ressenti
une grande peine en découvrant
sa duperie.
La profondeur de sa dépravation.
Le fait est, M. Cromwell,
que je lui ai donné autant d'amour
qu'elle me paraissait en donner ŕ Dieu
et aux Évangiles.
Aprčs sa Grace le Roi et vous-męme,
c'est elle que j'aimais le plus, de toutes
les créatures humaines.
Vous allez devoir apprendre
ŕ vivre sans elle.
Mais sans elle, notre réforme
est-elle en danger ?
Elle était notre plus grand soutien et
notre meilleur avocat.
Qui serait devenu
notre plus grande responsabilité.
Parfois, Votre Grace,
pour vaincre le diable
on doit apprendre ŕ le fréquenter.
Sa Majesté attend de Votre Grace
qu'elle trouve les arguments qui rendront
son mariage avec Anne Boleyn
nul et non avenu.
Il les attend rapidement.
Et les autres ?
Smeaton, Brereton,
Norris and George Boleyn
ont été jugés coupables,
et seront exécutés demain.
Vous savez ce que Cromwell m'a dit ?
Elle aurait connu plus de cent hommes !
Cent putain d'hommes, Charles.
Vous savez quoi ?
Vous savez quoi ?
Ma fille, Mary,
doit remercier Dieu
d'ętre sortie des griffes
de cette putain empoisonneuse.
Elle avait prévu d'avoir un enfant
empoisonné. C'est la vérité !
Tout comme elle a empoisonné Katherine.
Nous en avons la preuve
Son enfant...
Son enfant était difforme.
Vous le saviez, Charles ?
Ce ne pouvait donc pas ętre le mien !
Męme Élisabeth n'est peut-ętre
pas de moi !
Cette salope.
La reine a été jugée hier ŕ Westminster
Elle a plaidé non coupable de toutes
les charges retenues contre elle.
Mais les preuves étaient accablantes
Elle a été condamnée ŕ mort
par décapitation ou brűlée vive,
selon le bon plaisir du Roi.
Et ses complices ?
Qu'en est-il pour nous ?
Smeaton, Brereton, Norris and
George Boleyn, tous coupables.
Et moi ?
Je dois ętre jugé aussi.
Nous n'avons pas trouvé
de preuve contre vous.
Vous serez libéré.
Peut-ętre.
Je suis le seul qui était coupable.
Je vous le dit...
Je vous le dit, croyez en Dieu,
et non aux vanités de ce monde,
car si je l'avais fait,
je pense que je serais toujours vivant,
comme vous.
Ces jours sanglants ont brisé mon cśur.
Ma jeunesse et mon désir
les ont fait partir.
Beaucoup d'hommes pleureraient votre âme.
Et puisqu'il en est ainsi,
beaucoup pleurent encore.
Votre départ et votre mort
sont de grandes pertes
Votre ascension au dessus
de votre pauvre condition
Votre chute que vos amis
peuvent bien déplorer.
Une branche pourrie sur un si bel arbre
vous a fait perdre prise
et vous ętes morte.
Et partie.
Ces jours sanglants ont brisé mon cśur.
Ma convoitise,
Ma jeunesse les ont fait partir.
Le désir des âmes ambitieuses
aveugle.
Qui veut s'élever vite
cherche ŕ redescendre.
Et pour le trône
le tonnerre gronde.
Previously on The Tudors
Your daughter Jane should come to court,as lady to Her Majesty.
Imagine what it would mean for us if you did grow to love her.
There are some at court who would like to see the Queen replaced
Are you saying that I should be queen?
I wish there was a way I could remove Mistress Seymour from among my ladies.
When you have given the King his great desire,then you will
have all the power to deal with her as you like.
I have a new desire to renew my friendship with the Emperor.     -
You will find out the cost of friendship.
The Emperor is prepared to offer the King his support.
But on condition that the King declares Princess Mary to be his legitimate heir.
There remains one great obstacle...  we must find a way around it.
-He's been seduced by witchcraft. I have always believed it.
-My God!  -That is why she must die.
-You have not forsaken my bed  for that of another woman, but for another man.
-Something is going to happen to me.
-It's alright. Everything is going to be alright.
-The King has fallen from his horse and as been crushed.
He is likely to die.
-Oh God!
-As I lay there, your image came to me. Will you let me kiss you,Jane?
-Oh my God! What is this? Just while my belly
is doing his business, I find you wenching with Mistress Seymour.
Ah! Ah no no no...
Oh! Ah! -You've lost my boy.
But I see now,that God will not grant me any male children.
-You have no one to blame but yourself for this.
-I made this marriage seduced by witchcraft.
And for that reason, consider to be null
and void,so now I believe,
that I will take another wife

-The child had the appearance of a male,
about four months old.
However...
The foetus...
there were signs of deformity.
Of abnormality.
Perhaps,after all,
the Queen's miscarriage
was a blessing in disguise.
Majesty.
-Madame. -Monsieur Ambassadeur...
I beg you: King Francis must be persuaded
to accept the marriage of his son to our daughter Elizabeth,
so that I may not be ruined or lost,
for I see myself very near that
and in more trouble and grief than I was ever in before my marriage...
I cannot speak to you more fully now,
nor dare I express my fears in writing. But please,
after everything I've done for France,
as you love me,do the best you can for me,
for God's sake.
-Mr. Edward Seymour.
-Master Seymour. -Mr. Secretary.
-We don't know each  other well.
But we shall. I have every confidence.
It is His Majesty's pleasure
to appoint you a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber.
In that capacity,you will attend His Majesty daily,
and as he sees fit to use you.  It is,you will understand that,
a special and privileged position.
-I do understand.
And I am deeply honored, Mr. Secretary.
-There is... one more thing.
His Majesty has indicated to me
he would like to pay court to your sister,from time to time,
although to avoid any scandal attaching himself to your sister's name
only in the presence of a member,or members, of your family.
In which case, I am more than happy to
offer you and your family
my private chambers in the palace.
As it happens,they are adjacent to the King's private chambers,
the connecting gallery for greater privacy.
-You are most generous,  Mr. Secretary.
I am sure my father will like to repay your kindness.
-You've given the Seymours your rooms?
-Yes,Your Majesty.  -Idiot.
We have just given royal assent to the Act stripping
the bishopric of Norwich of the town of Lynn.
The new beneficiary is to be Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wiltshire.
I also intend giving him two of the dissolved abbeys.
You must inform him of his good fortune.
-Yes,Your Majesty.
-No one must know our plans, Mr. Cromwell.
-Come here,Jane. Let me look at you.
How beautiful you are!
Ready?  -Yes.
-Shall we?
-Jane.  -Your Majesty.
-I have something for you.
Now open it.
-Thank you.
I will treasure this all my life.
And if they ever open my grave, they will find it again,
right next to my heart.
-Majesty.
-I wonder why,after all this time,he still will not marry Madge?
-I think Norris comes
into your chamber more for Your  Majesty than he does for Madge.
-For me?  -Yeah.
-Cromwell's rooms?  -Yes.
-What is that?
-It's a locket,Your Majesty.
-Let me see it.
Let me see it.
-Mr. Secretary!
-Your Majesty.
I have some good news for Your Majesty. The Bill for the dissolution
of the large monasteries has just been passed Parliament.
Our reformation is moving apace.
-I have been told privately, Mr. Secretary,that the King has already sold
Sawley Abbey in Yorkshire to one of his courtiers,
even though the Bill has not yet reached the statute book,and
plainly on your advice.
Our reformation was never meant to be about personal gain.
Religious houses should not be sold off
but converted to better uses.
-Madam,
the confiscated assets will be used to the pleasure of Almighty God
and to the profit of this realm
which is but a pygmy,
but will one day be greater even than Spain!
-So is it true you have given your private rooms here to the Seymours?
I am the Queen of England. You will answer me. Is it true?
-Yes. It's true.
-You have over-reached yourself,Mr. Cromwell.
Believe me,you have placed yourself in very great danger.
Do you believe me?
Or do you assume I no longer posses the power to crush you?
It would be an easy mistake      to make,Mr. Cromwell.
-I thought you might like this returned to you.
-Thank you.
-Good evening Your Excellency,
Please,may I take your hat?
-His Excellency the Imperial Ambassador.
-Ah,Eustace. It's so good of you to come all the way
to Shoreditch. -Believe me,Mr. Secretary,
I would travel a great deal further for the pleasure of talking to you.
May I be blunt?
Is it true that you have
fallen out with Queen Anne?
-Yes.
I believe she hates me
wants to have me executed.
-Are you not afraid?
-No.
No I trust my master so much...
I fancy she can't do me any harm.
-Nevertheless, I cannot but wish you
a more gracious mistress.
One more grateful for the
inestimable service you have done the King.
-For the sake of argument,
suppose the King
was considering
taking another wife?
-It would certainly be to his advantage.
For here is a King
who has so far been disappointed of male issue,
and who knows very well that his present marriage
will never be held as lawful.
-The king requests your presence at the court.
I am sure he wishes to confirm a new alliance with the Emperor.
What else he means to tell you,I cannot guess.
-Then I look forward
eagerly to finding out, Mr. Secretary.
-Madam,
Lady Rochford. -Lady Rochford,
what can I do for you?
-You could ask your brother to be kind to me.
He is cruel in every way.
-Come now... I don't believe you.
-There are others he has preferred to me.
-Hush!
-You don't understand.
He does not treat me as his proper wife,
as the King treats you.
-Let me tell you something, Lady Rochford.
The King cannot satisfy a woman.
He has neither the skill, nor the virility.
-We must give up the idea of a French alliance.
The King seems implacably against it,
just as he seems more and more inclined to embrace a new alliance with the Emperor...
Are you listening to me?
-Yes,father.
-It seems that most of the country is still in favor
of an Imperial alliance, so it would serve us
nothing to swim against the tide.
-No.
-The Imperial Ambassador is to be received at court.
You will make a great fuss of him. In the first place
by inviting him to kiss your cheek.
Then you and the King will dine with him,
and you will say some harsh things against the French
in the presence of the other ambassadors say how they
have betrayed your trust,are hypocrites and false friends.
Whatever you can think of. -Yes Father.
-Anne,we have come so far.
No one is going to be allowed
to destroy us.
No one!
Do you understand?
-I understand.
-His Excellency, the Imperial Ambassador.
-Jesus.
-Their gracious Majesties
[Greetings]
-After Mass,Mr. Chapuys is sure to dine with us?
But he's gone!
-It is not without good reason.
-Something is happening,Mark.
I just don't know what it is.
-Eminency,
I know that,in the past,there have been misunderstandings
between my family and you.
Some intemperate words.
Certain things that should not have been said,
and are now regretted.
But we both live in a real world.
We must take our friends as we find them.
I know the Emperor is keen to protect
his lucrative trade links with England.
And obviously my family is in a position to help and assist him
which is what we are determined to do.
-So I think we should drink a toast to new beginnings,
and new friendships and to a mutually beneficial future.
-Salut.  -Salut.
-Salut.
-And where are you from, Excellency?
-I am proud to be the Ambassador from Milan,Madam.
-Ah,Milan.
Were you not occupied by the French?
-Alas,we are still
occupied by French troops.
-Then you will agree with me that the French are deceitful in everything?
In fact,can anyone here tell me
that the French are anything but liars and hypocrites?
Do they ever tell the truth?
How many treaties do they honor,
how many promises do they keep?
-Mr. Cromwell, what is happening?
-His Majesty will soon be having an audience with
the Ambassador. That's what we're waiting for.
-Your Excellency,
follow me.
-Excuse me.
-Excellency.
I hear your master is anxious for an alliance?
-He is,Your Majesty.  -On what terms?
-On such terms as Mr. Cromwell
has outlined to us.
The restoration of some relation
between England and Rome,
the inclusion of the Lady Mary in the line of succession,
and support for the Emperor in his war with France over Milan.
As far as the Lady Mary is concerned,
it may be that God has not thought to send Your Majesty
a male issue because he believes that
England should have a female succession.
-What are you alleging,Excellency?
Am I not a man as other men?
Am I not?
AM I NOT?
You do not know all my secrets.
I want everything in writing.  The Emperor's offer.
Everything in writing. -That is not possible, Your Majesty.
-Do you think I am a child,
to be first whipped and then petted?
If your master wants to deal with me,he must first apologize
for all his ill-treatment on me in the past.
He must accept Queen Anne.
I have nothing more to say to your master.
-Princes are different from us, and are not to be easily understood.
Gentlemen
-Your Grace.  -Majesty.
As your oldest friend
as well as your most loyal subject.
I feel it's my duty, however painful
to report some truths to you.
-"Truth?",said jesting Pilate.
"What is truth?"
-There are rumors about the Queen's behavior.
It seems
she entertains men in her rooms,
flirts
and behaves intimately with them...
-My Lords,this kingdom is in peril and in danger.
But not by some foreign power or strangers with evil intent against us.
It has come to my notice
that some acts of treason, and other offences,
have been committed by those we loved and trusted,
by members of our own court.
Mr. Rich,
as Solicitor General I am appointing
you and Mr. Cromwell
to head a commission of oyer and terminer
to investigate whether or not these offences be true.
Good day,gentlemen.
-Lady Sheldon,
I warn you not to repeat to anyone
what passes between us here today.
You live in close proximity with Her Majesty the Queen.
Have you ever seen her entertain men
in her chambers in what you would consider an
inappropriate way?
-No,Sir.
-You are certain?
-Yes,Sir.
-I must warn you,my Lady,
that those concealing the truth from those
commissioned by the King to discover it,are themselves
guilty of treason,
and are very likely to be hanged.
-Your Majesty.
-Jane. For very good reasons
I want you to leave Whitehall for a while.
Go back home with your father. -I will leave.
Of course I will do anything Your Majesty commands me to do.
-I want to tell you that in this slippery world,
you represent for me all that is innocent,
everything that is good,
unsullied,
uncorrupted.
It will not be for long.
And after that...
After that we can have our hearts' desires.
Go.
-Are you certain?
C'mon!
-It's true that some men
came into the Queen's chambers...
at undue hours.
And sometimes she flirted with them but...
-What are their names?
-Lord Rochford... of course.
-And?
-And Sir Henry Norris...
-And?
-The King's groom,Brereton...
-And?
-Mark Smeaton,the musician...
-And?
AND?
-Well,I saw her hugging and kissing her brother.
-Her brother?
-But thought nothing of it...
-Do you believe this to be true?
-I believe that is true,yes.
-You believe that your husband
has committed incest with the Queen?
-Hello?
Hello?
Ah! Mr. Cromwell,
to what do I owe this great pleasure?
-Shhh... Calm Mr. Smeaton.
-Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
-I want to know when you slept with the Queen. And how many times you slept with her?
-I never slept with the Queen.
I never slept with the Queen.
I don't understand. Mr. Cromwell.
-You gonna have to tell the truth. I want the truth.
Or God help me it will go badly with you.
-I swear by Almighty God.
I never slept with Her Majesty.
Don't do anything to hurt me.
-You are only a poor musician  and yet recently you spent a great deal of money
on horses and liveries for your servants! Where did you get the money?
Was it for services rendered.
-I swear to God Almighty.
I never slept with Her Majesty.
-Off we go,and...
Now,quicker then... ?
One,two,three,four...
Ah,Lady Sheldon! I believe you know what you are doing.
Left arm... comme a.
Back,and after spring...
Continue.
-Your visit to France with the King is postponed for a week.
-Why?
-And there's something else...
Mark Smeaton is arrested.
-What for? -We don't know yet.
I've gotta go.
-Sir Henry,you are here again!
Did you never seem to have the courage to marry the Lady?
-Madam,
marriage is not something to hurry into.
-No. I know the truth.
You look for dead men's shoes.
-Madam? I really must protest.
-I mean,you suppose that if anything bad
happen to the King, then you would think to have me.
-Madam,if I ever had such a thought,
then I wish my head were cut off.
-Oh,that could be arranged.
Nan,
-Madam.
Get them to fetch Elizabeth to me tomorrow. I want to see my daughter.
-Yes,Madam. -And,Nan,
if anything should happen to me,
would you promise to care for her?
-Yes,Madam.
[Screaming]
-Sooner or later,Mr. Smeaton, you will tell us the truth.
So?
-It's not true. -What?
-It's not true. -What?  -It's not true.
-The King has called an emergency meeting of the Council.
-Why wasn't I told?
-Because I wasn't told either!
For God's sake, make sure you keep the King always in your sight!
-Majesty!
Mr. Cromwell approaches.
-Smeaton has confessed.
-Sir Henry...  -Sir.  -Come with me!
Did you know the Queen was pregnant again?
-No,your Majesty! How should I?
-Because you may be the child's father...
...since you love her so well, as many have testified.
-Your Majesty is being ridiculous.
-So then I'm a figure of ridicule to you?
-Guards! Arrest him.
Take him to the Tower!
-Majesty?... Majesty?... Majesty?
Benedicta et venerabilis es,virgo Maria. Virgo dei genetrix,quem totus capit orbis,
in tua se clausit viscera, facta homo.
Dei genitrix intercede pro nobis.
In nomine Patris et Filii...  -Master Brereton,
by order of the King you are arrested for High Treason.  -...et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.
-Where are you going,my Lord?
-I have to see the King. -It's too late,George.
Much too late.
-My Lord... Sir Thomas...
you are both arrested for High Treason,and having
carnal knowledge of her Majesty the Queen.
-What?
-Henry,please.
Henry,please.
For the love you bear our child. For the love of Elizabeth...
-You lied to me. You have always lied to me. -Have mercy. No.
-You were not a virgin when you married me.
You were not what you seemed.
Your father and your brother arranged everything.
-No. I loved you...
I loved you and I love you still.
Please after everything we have been to each other.
After everything we were. Please.
One more chance... One more...
Henry...
Your Majesty...
Your Majesty... I beseech you.
-You know why you have been arrested.
It is not enough that you commit vile incest
on your sister the Queen, her tongue in your mouth,
your tongue in hers,
against the commands of God Almighty...
But you must plot regicide
against the King,
so that Anne could marry  one of her lover's and rule
as regent for her bastard child.
-No,sir.
You baffle me.
My enemies
have poisoned the air with their horrid lies.
Whatever my sister has done,
it is not with me,or mine.
I am innocent,Mr. Cromwell.
I swear to you.
I swear on the blood of Christ.
I am innocent.
-Course you are.
Tell me,Mr. Brereton
did you ever have
carnal knowledge of the Queen's Majesty?
-Yes.
Yes,I did.
-I condemn them utterly. All those men,
whatever their rank or station...
whatever their rank or station,who...
deceived the King and slipped between the sheets with his lawful wife.
I can't...
...utterly.
For such
awful adultery,
there should be only one punishment.
-My Lords,why have you come?
-This is the warrant for your arrest.
You are charged with committing adultery with Mark Smeaton,
Sir Henry Norris and William Brereton.
Both Smeaton and Brereton
have already confessed their guilt.
-We are come at the King's command
to conduct you to the Tower,there to abide
during His Majesty's pleasure.
-If it be His Majesty's pleasure,
then I am ready to obey.
Lady Sh--   -There is no time to change your clothes
or pack any of your things.
Money will be provided for your needs at the Tower.
-My Lords,I beg you,
before you go,to beseech the King's Grace
to be good to me.
-Madame,this way,I pray you.
-I pray God will help me, for there is no truth in these allegations.
-This way.
-I am the King's true wedded wife!
I am not guilty of these charges.
I am as free from the company of man
as I am from sin.
Do I go into a dungeon, Mr. Kingston?
-No,Madam. There are lodgings made ready for you.
-It's too good for me.
Jesus have mercy on me.
Thank you,thank you.
May I have the Holy Sacrament placed in my room, so I may pray for mercy?
-Your Grace.
-Your Grace?
-I have just heard of the Queen's arrest.
My mind is clean amazed.
I cannot believe that she is guilty of such abominable crimes...
...yet I cannot think
the King would have proceeded so far
unless she was culpable.
-It has caused both the King and myself
a great pain to discover her deceit;
the depth of her depravity.
-The fact is,Mr. Cromwell,
that I loved her not a little for the love
which I judged her to bear towards God and the Gospel.
Next to his grace the King,and yourself,
I was most bound to her of all creatures living.
-Then you must learn to live without her.
-But,without her,is not our reformation in danger?
Was she not our great supporter and advocate?
-Who would likely have become our greatest liability.
Sometimes,Your Grace, in order to defeat evil,
one must learn to consort with the devil.
His Majesty is waiting for Your Grace
to discover a reason why his marriage to Anne Boleyn
should be considered null and void.
He expects your verdict presently.
-What of the others?
-Smeaton,Brereton,
Norris and George Boleyn
have been found guilty...
and are to be executed tomorrow.
-You know what Cromwell told me?
He told me she had to do with over a hundred men!
A hundred fucking men,Charles.
You know what?
You know what? My daughter, Mary,owes God a great deal
for escaping the hands of that poisoning whore.
She planned to have a poisoned child... It's true!
just like she poisoned Katharine.
We have proof.
Her baby...
Her baby was deformed. Did you know that Charles?
So it couldn't have been mine!
Perhaps Elizabeth isn't even mine!
That fucking bitch.
-The Queen was tried yesterday at Westminster Hall.
She pleaded not guilty to all the charges against her
but the evidence being overwhelming,
she was sentenced to death, either by burning or by decapitation,
according to the King's pleasure.
-And her accomplices?
What of us?
-Smeaton,Brereton, Norris and George Boleyn, all guilty as charged.
-Thomas,what about me?
Am I to be tried too.
-No. We found no evidence against you.
You are to be released.
Eventually.
-I am the only one who is guilty.
-I say to you...
I say to you trust in God,
and not in the vanities of this world,
for if I had done so,
I think I would still be alive,
as you are now.
-Oh God...
-These bloody days have broken my heart:
My lust,my youth did them depart.
For your wit alone,many men would bemoan.
And since it is so,
many still cry loud.
It is a great loss that you are dead and gone.
The time you had about above your poor degree.
The fall whereof your  friends may well bemoan.
A rotten twig
upon so high a tree
has slipped your hold,  and you are dead.
And gone.
These bloody days have  broken my heart.
My lust.
My youth did them depart,
and blind desire  of ambitious souls.
Who hastes to climb
seeks to revert:
And about the throne
the thunder rolls.
Dans les épisodes précédents...
en ce monde incertain,
vous représentez pour moi l'innocence,
Tout ce qui est bon,
Qu'est ce que c'est ?
Montrez le moi.
Nous sommes arrivés si haut. Personne n'a
le droit de nous détruire, tu comprends ?
Concernant la légitimation de Lady Mary,
il reste un grand obstacle
que nous devons contourner.
Il court des rumeurs sur le comportement
de la Reine.
Elle aurait des relations intimes avec
des hommes, la nuit, dans ses appartements.
Il est vrai que des hommes viennent
dans les appartements de la Reine.
Leurs noms ?
Le valet du Roi, Brereton, et
Sir Henry Norris, et Mark Smeaton.
Et ?
Je l'ai vue étreindre et embrasser
son frčre.
Vous ętes arrętés pour Haute Trahison
et connaissance charnelle de la Reine.
Quoi ?
- Pitié, pour l'amour d'Élisabeth.
- Vous m'avez menti, toujours.
Vous n'ętes pas celle
que vous semblez ętre.
C'est votre ordre d'arrestation,
vous ętes accusée d'adultčre.
Sur ordre du Roi, nous devons vous conduire
ŕ la Tour.
Elle m'a humilié, Charles,
je la hais !
Pour un adultčre aussi terrible,
il n'y a qu'une punition.
La Reine a été jugée hier.
Elle est condamnée au bucher
ou ŕ la pendaison,
selon le bon vouloir du Roi.
Beaucoup pensent que j'ai changé, au fond
de moi, je suis toujours un humaniste
Je vous promets qu'on se souviendra de moi
pour l'éternité.
Il ne fait aucun doute que votre rčgne
passera ŕ la postérité.
Je vous en rends grâce Seigneur,
Vous m'avez sauvée
de l'injustice, de la diffamation
et d'un Roi inique.
Mon âme Te remerciera au delŕ de ma mort
car Tu délivres ceux qui T'attendent.
Assez !
Faites place ŕ la Princesse Élisabeth.
Faites place.
Faites place ŕ Sa Grâce.
Maître Kingston,
Madame.
Madame, je peux maintenant vous dire que
le Roi a décidé de vous éviter le bűcher.
et de vous accorder une mort rapide
par décapitation.
Dans sa miséricorde, le Roi accčde
également ŕ votre désir
d'avoir recours aux services
du bourreau de Calais.
qui est d'ailleurs en route,
depuis Douvres.
Quand dois-je mourir ?
A 9 heures.
Cela me convient.
Pouvez-vous faire chercher l'Archevęque
Cranmer pour qu'il reçoive ma confession
et m'administre les Derniers Sacrements ?
Madame.
A l'Empereur.
Mon neveu,
Les nouvelles de ce jour vous apporterons,
je pense, de grandes satisfactions.
Laissons toutes les querelles
derričre nous,
travaillons ŕ la croissance du commerce
et de la prospérité entre nous,
et unissons-nous contre ce bâtard,
le Roi de France.
Avant tout, c'est la perspective
du changement que j'aime.
Maître Kingston, dites-moi,
comment va-t-elle ?
Franchement, dans les premiers jours
de sa captivité
elle disait souvent des choses
plutôt extravagantes.
Par exemple, qu'il ne pleuvrait plus
tant qu'elle ne serait pas relâchée.
Mais maintenant, selon son aumônier,
de toutes ses pensées,
elle se prépare ŕ sa mort
qu'elle a, je le crois, acceptée.
J'en suis heureux.
Néanmoins...
je suis affligé de devoir
lui causer une nouvelle douleur.
Madame, je dois vous dire
que votre mariage avec le roi a été annulé.
Sur quels fondements ?
Au motif de votre étroit
et illégal degré de parenté
avec une autre femme
que le Roi a connu charnellement
Ma sśur...
Alors, ma fille est... ?
Elizabeth doit ętre déclarée bâtarde.
Je vous jure que je ferrais tout ce qui est
en mon pouvoir pour la protéger et l'aider
et la garder dans les bonnes grâces du Roi.
Merci.
Maintenant que mes heures sont comptées,
je vous prie de recevoir ma confession,
et j'aimerai que le Connétable soit présent
quand je recevrais le Seigneur.
Mon enfant,
Devez-vous vous confesser ?
Devant Dieu, je confesse mon innocence.
Je jure solennellement,
mon âme en soit damnée,
que je n'ai jamais été infidčle
ŕ mon seigneur et mari,
et ne lui ai jamais porté offense
avec mon corps
Je ne prétends pas avoir toujours eu
l'humilité que je lui devais,
au regard de la bonté
et de l'honneur qu'il m'a donné
et du grand respect
qu'il m'a toujours accordé.
Je reconnais aussi que j'ai souvent
ressenti de la jalousie ŕ son égard
Mais, Dieu m'en est témoin, je n'ai jamais
commis d'autre pęché contre lui.
Ne croyez pas que je dis ceci
dans l'espoir de prolonger ma vie.
Dieu m'a appris comment mourir,
et Il renforcera ma foi.
Quant ŕ mon frčre...
et ŕ ceux qui ont été
injustement condamnés,
J'aurais volontiers souffert milles morts
pour les sauver
mais, puisque c'est la volonté du Roi,
je veux les accompagner dans la mort.
Avec la certitude
que je vivrais éternellement avec eux
dans la paix.
Au nom du Pčre, du Fils et
du Saint Esprit.
Maître Kingston,
assurez vous de rapporter la derničre
et véritable confession de Madame
afin que le monde la connaisse.
Je le ferais.
M. Cranmer, je n'imagine pas que,
męme en ces derniers moments,
les évęques évangéliques que nous avons mis
en place pourraient intervenir pour moi ?
Votre Majesté, je...
Non, je comprends
Comment pourraient-ils ?
Pardonnez-moi.
C'est fait ?
La catin est morte ?
Je ne sais pas.
Mais ça ne saurait tarder.
Le Seigneur est bon.
Dites-moi, pourquoi doit-elle
vraiment mourir ?
On dit que son enfant, Élisabeth,
n'a pas été conçu par le Roi
mais par un de ses innombrables amants.
Combien est-elle sensée en avoir eu ?
Selon M. Cromwell, plus d'une centaine,
dont son propre frčre, Rochford.
On me dit qu'elle me reproche
ce qui lui est arrivé,
et me tient pour responsable
de son triste sort.
Pour moi, c'est un honneur
car elle m'aurait jeté aux chiens
si elle avait pu.
Parlez-moi de l'autre femme,
cette Jane Seymour.
On m'a confié qu'elle est de notre foi,
que le roi l'aime et qu'il envisage
de l'épouser.
Et qu'elle pense ŕ réintroduire Votre Grâce
dans la succession.
Élisabeth va devenir
une bâtarde maintenant ?
- Comme moi je l'ai été ?
- Oui, Princesse.
La gamine est désormais
officiellement une bâtarde.
Dis-leur de préparer les chevaux.
Mais pas un mot sur notre destination.
Il y a temps pour tout,
et chaque chose sous le ciel a son heure
Temps de naître et temps de mourir,
Temps de planter, temps de détruire,
Temps de pleurer
et temps de rire.
Temps d'assembler les blocs,
temps de les disperser,
Temps de gémir,
temps de danser,
Ce qui se fait existait déjŕ,
et ce qui se fera
a déjŕ été.
Un temps pour chercher
et un temps pour perdre
Un temps pour garder,
et un temps pour jeter ;
Un temps pour déchirer,
et un temps pour coudre
Un temps pour se taire,
et un temps pour parler
J’ai dit dans mon cśur
Dieu jugera le juste et le méchant,
car il y a lŕ un temps pour toute chose
C'est maintenant ?
Je croyais...
Madame, pardonnez-moi...
le bourreau est retardé sur la route
de Douvres
et votre exécution est reportée ŕ midi.
J'ai voulu vous dire, en temps utile,
au cas oů…
Maître Kingston.
Vous me dites
que je ne mourrais pas avant midi,
j'en suis désolé mais je pensais ętre morte
ŕ cette heure lŕ et ne plus souffrir
Madame, vous ne souffrirez pas.
Le coup sera si soudain.
Oui, le bourreau est trčs bon,
parait-il.
Et puis, de toute façon,
j'ai un petit cou.
Pčre ?
Monsieur ?
Mon Dieu.
Ce n'est pas un jouet.
Alors...
tu as déjŕ tué quelqu'un ?
Pendant une bataille.
Qu'est-ce qu'on ressent ?
C'était mon ennemi.
Ca m'était égal.
J'aimerai vraiment voir mourir quelqu'un.
Je peux venir voir l'exécution avec vous ?
Combien ont-ils facturé l'échafaudage ?
23 livres, 6 shillings et 8 pence
M. le Secrétaire.
C'est du vol en plein jour.
Et combien pour le bourreau,
s’il arrive un jour ?
15 livres.
15 livres ?
Pour un coup ?
Mon Dieu,
c'est vraiment la belle vie !
Bon, c'est fait ?
C'est fait ?
Non, Votre Majesté.
On a du malheureusement ŕ nouveau
reporter l'exécution.
Quoi ?
Le bourreau était en retard.
Alors trouvez quelqu'un d'autre,
vous m'entendez ?
Retrouvez celui
qui s'est occupé des autres.
Il était assez bon, non ?
Il n'a pas bousillé la chose.
Votre Majesté a fait une promesse.
Qu'est-ce que j'en ai ŕ faire
de mes promesses ŕ cette pute ?
La promesse de Votre Majesté
est connue de tous, c'est tout...
Je m'en fous !
Je vous ai ordonné
de trouver quelqu'un d'autre.
Je la veux morte !
Je veux qu'on en finisse !
Terminé !
Faites-le ou, par le Sang du Christ,
vous allez la rejoindre !
J'ai dit !
Remettez ŕ plus tard !
Allons-y.
Maître Kingston, je suis pręte.
Madame, pardonnez-moi encore une fois.
Le bourreau n'est toujours pas lŕ.
Que dites-vous ?
Madame, votre exécution est reportée
ŕ 9 heures demain matin.
Non, ce n'est pas possible.
Ce n'est pas que je souhaite mourir,
mais je...
Je m'étais préparée,
j'étais pręte.
Je crains que ce nouveau délai
affaiblisse ma résolution.
S'il vous plait,
serait-il possible...
Non, Madame...
C'est l'ordre formel du Roi.
Non, attendez !
Peut-ętre ne suis-je pas destiné
ŕ mourir.
Ces reports, ils signifient quelque chose.
Peut-ętre le Roi est-il
en train de me sonder.
Je serais envoyé au couvent.
Vous savez, Sir John, j'en suis certain,
que mon mariage a été annulé.
J'ai été informé des circonstances,
Votre Majesté.
Et comme tous, j'ai été choqué et stupéfié
par ce que j'ai entendu.
Je vous en sais gré.
Mais je dois vous dire...
Le Conseil Privé, malgré ces maux récents,
c'est prononcé en faveur
d'un nouveau mariage
dans l'espoir de voir la mariée produire
un héritier légitime.
Vous savez, je le pense, que mon choix
c'est porté sur votre fille.
Je le sais.
Demain...
vous viendrez tous en bateau
ŕ Hampton Court,
oů nos fiançailles seront annoncées.
Je vous jure, Sir John,
que tout, ŕ partir de demain,
sera différent.
Nous serons jeunes
et joyeux comme nous avions
coutume de l'ętre.
Je ne le mettrais pas!
Tu ne peux pas m'obliger.
Je ne vais pas !
Lady Élisabeth, vous devez faire ce qu'on
vous dit, dépęchez-vous, ou je vous frappe.
Ne faite pas cette tęte, jeune fille !
Nous avons l'ordre de retirer cet enfant
de la vue du Roi.
Petite Princesse.
Elle n'est plus une Princesse,
c'est une bâtarde.
Et Maître Cromwell a demandé que
ses comptes soient adaptés
en tenant compte de ce qui est nécessaire
pour sa mčre ŕ la Tour.
Vous voulez dire que cet enfant devrait
payer pour les frais de prison de sa mčre ?
Sur la pension que lui verse le Roi ?
Exactement.
Le monde est un endroit instable, Madame.
Si vous voulez mon avis,
pour ce qu'il vaut
trouvez un riche mari trop bęte
pour s'intéresser ŕ la politique.
Alors, peut-ętre, si vous ne mourrez pas
en couche, ce qui est probable,
ou de la peste,
ce qui est presque inévitable
alors, vous serez heureuse.
De quoi voulez-vous parler, Mon cśur ?
Si votre Majesté le permet, j'aimerai
parler de votre fille Mary.
Quand je serais la Reine je voudrais qu'elle
soit rétablie comme héritier présomptif.
Jane, vous ętes folle de souhaiter ça.
Vous devez solliciter l'avancement
des enfants que nous allons avoir,
d'aucun autres.
Mais, Votre Majesté, je pensais moins
au bien des autres qu'au bien,
au repos et...
ŕ la tranquillité de votre propre personne
ainsi que des enfants que nous aurons.
Et ŕ la tranquilité du Royaume
de Votre Majesté.
Pardonnez-moi.
Je souhaite tellement un nouveau départ.
Une renaissance.
Le rappel des choses est parfois difficile.
Vous comprenez ?
Vous ętes si pure.
Je veux juste que vous ne soyez pas
affectées par les choses du passé.
Puis-je vous embrasser, Jane ?
N'ętes vous pas le Roi d'Angleterre ?
Tout va changer pour elle.
Ce baiser est son destin et sa chance.
Et les nôtres.
Vous savez, quand j'étais jeune,
j'étais ŕ la Cour de Margaret d'Autriche.
C'était une époque magnifique.
Reconstitutions et danses.
Tellement de danses.
Une fois j'ai joué la Reine des Amazones,
une épée dans la main
et une coiffe rouge avec une grande plume
Mais Margaret était avisée.
Elle nous disait
Ayez confiance en ceux qui vous offrent
leur service
et, pour finir, Mesdemoiselles,
vous serez de ceux qui auront été trompés.
Je vais...
Je vais ętre jugé ?
Vous devez ętre libéré.
Mais...
Sa Majesté ordonne, puisque vous ne
n'avez plus sa confiance ni son affection,
que tous vos titres et fonctions officielles
vous soient retirés
Vous ne serez plus au Conseil Privé
Vous abandonnerez votre fonction de
Lord du Sceau Privé et tous ses privilčges.
Le Roi souhaite également
que vous quittiez la Cour.
Et que vous ne vous présentiez plus jamais
devant lui,
sous peine de mort.
Alors je garde mon titre de Comte ?
Avez-vous apprécié la mort de votre fils ?
Et votre fille ?
Vous aimerez son supplice ?
Vous la regarderez mourir ?
Dites-moi, Boleyn,
Ca valait tout ça ?
Halte !
Vous voyez ça ?
Vous savez ce que c'est ?
C'est la Fontaine de Jouvence.
Regardez !
Je renais !
Par ici, Monsieur.
Je regrette profondément votre retard.
Puis-je la voir ?
Elle est belle, non ?
L'exécution est prévue pour 9 heures.
Vous serez réveillé deux heures avant
pour prendre votre petit déjeuner.
Bon, si tout est en ordre...
Je dois vous dire quelques mots.
La dame ne doit pas ętre entravée,
en quelque façon.
Mais il est essentiel qu'elle
ne se retourne pas comme cela
par peur de l'épée.
Alors, d'abord,
je cache l'épée,
pour qu'elle ne puisse la voir.
C'est normal qu'ils cherchent partout,
pour voir d'oů...
la mort va arriver. Non ?
Aussi, quand elle aura fini de prier
et qu'elle sera pręte...
Je dis ŕ l'assistant, en face d'elle,
Allez chercher mon épée.
Bien sűr, la dame regarde l'homme.
Et c'est l'angle parfait pour moi
Quand elle regarde l'homme...
Je frappe. Et...
Vous comprenez ?
Je crois, oui.
Ca va vite, elle ne sent rien.
Vous ne serez pas déçu.
J'en suis sűr.
Tu sais si je mérite cette mort.
Pas ma volonté Seigneur, mais la Tienne
doit s'accomplir.
Je rendrais gloire ŕ Ton nom
car Tu es mon aide et ma protection.
Tu m'as protégée et préservée, moi...
<i>Il va t'attraper !</i>
Madame, le moment approche,
il faut vous préparer.
Faites votre devoir,
je suis pręte depuis longtemps.
Le Roi demande
que vous preniez cette bourse
Il y a 20 livres.
Pour payer les services du bourreau
et faire l'aumône aux pauvres.
Merci.
Veuillez me suivre,
ainsi que vos servantes.
Maître Kingston, je vous prie de ne pas
donner le signal de ma mort
avant que je n'ai dit
ce que j'ai l'intention de dire.
Bon peuple chrétien,
Je suis venu ici pour mourir,
conformément ŕ la loi et pour, de moi-męme,
me plier,
ŕ la volonté du Roi
mon Seigneur.
Vive le Roi.
Et si, dans ma vie, j'ai pu offenser
la Grâce du Roi,
alors, certainement, par ma mort,
je vais maintenant expier.
Je prie,
et vous demande ŕ tous,
de prier pour la vie du Roi.
Dieu garde le Roi.
Mon Souverain Seigneur
et le votre,
qui est un des meilleurs princes
de ce monde,
qui m'a toujours si bien traitée.
C'est pourquoi je me soumets ŕ la mort
avec bonne volonté,
demandant humblement le pardon
de tout le monde.
Si quelqu'un doit s'intéresser ŕ mon cas,
je lui demande seulement de le juger
avec bonté.
Merci.
Pardonnez-moi pour ce que je dois faire.
Avec joie.
Voici votre bourse.
Je dois donc prendre congé du monde...
et de vous.
Soyez bénie...
Et je vous demande chaleureusement
de tous prier pour moi.
Que le Seigneur ai pitié de vous.
Le Seigneur est mon berger.
Je ne serais pas dans le besoin.
Il me fait m'allonger
dans les pâturages verts.
Il me conduit vers les eaux calmes ...
Jésus, reçois mon âme.
Seigneur Dieu, aie pitié de mon âme.
Je remets mon âme au Christ.
Merci.
Je m'en remets au Christ.
Donnez-moi mon épée !
Faites place ŕ la Maison du Roi.
Faites place.
Faites place ŕ la Maison du Roi.
Puisse le Seigneur Jésus
ętre de chair et de sang.

<i>Previously on Tudors...</i>
In this ippery world you represent
for me all that is innocent.
- Everything that is good.
- What is that?
- Let me see it.
- Ah!
We have come so far. No one is
going to be allowed to destroy us.
Do you understand?
In the question of
legitimizing the Lady Mary,
there remains one great obstacle.
We must find a way around it.
There are some rumors about
the Queen's behavior. It seems,
she entertains men in her room at
night and behaves intimately with them.
It's true that some men came
into the Queen's chambers.
- What are their names?
- The King's groom, Brereton...
- And Sir Henry Norris,
and Mark Smeaton - And?!
Well I saw her hugging
and kissing her brother.
You are both arrested for
High Treason, and having...
- ...carnal knowledge of her
Majesty the Queen. - What?
For the love of Elizabeth!
Have mercy!
You lied to me! You've always lied
to me. You are not what you seem!
This is the warrant for your arrest. You
are charged with committing adultery.
We are come at the King's command
to conduct you to the Tower.
She's humiliated me,
Charles! I hate her!
For such awful adultery, there
should be only one punishment.
The Queen was tried yesterday.
She was sentenced to
death either by burning
or decapitation according
to the King's pleasure.
Most people think I've changed.
At heart, I'm still a humanist.
I promise you that I shall
be remembered eternally.
I have no doubt whatsoever that your
Majesty's reign will always be remembered.
The Tudors
Season 2 -  Episode 10
I will give glory to thee O Lord:
for you have saved me
from injustice, from slanderous
tongues and an unjust king.
My soul shall praise thee
even to the last to my death,
for thou deliveries
those that wait for thee.
ENOUGH!
Make way for Princess Elizabeth.
Make way there.
Make way for her Grace.
- Master Kingston.
- My Lady.
My Lady, I can now tell you
that the King has decreed
that you will not be burned,
but suffer a quicker death
by decapitation.
In his mercy, the King has
also acceded to your plea
to use the services of
the Executioner of Calais,
who is even now on his
way here from Dover.
- When am I to die?
- At nine o'clock.
I am content.
Will you please send
for Archbishop Cranmer,
so he may hear my last confession
and administer Holy Communion?
My Lady.
"To the Emperor. Nephew.
"This day will
bring you, I think,
"news of great satisfaction.
"Let us put all
quarrels behind us.
"And work for an accommodation
that will increase the trade
"and prosperity between us.
"And unite us against that
bastard, the King of France.
"Above all, I love the
prospect of change."
Master Kingston, tell
me, how is the Lady?
Truthfully, in the early
days of her captivity
she often spoke rather wildly.
For example, that it would not
rain until she was released.
But now, according
to her almoner,
preparations for death have
increasingly occupied her thoughts,
and so I believe she
is reconciled to it.
I am glad.
Although...
it grieves that I must
cause her further pain.
My Lady, I am
obliged to tell you
that your marriage to the King
has been declared null and void.
On what grounds?
On the grounds of your close
and forbidden degree of affinity
to another woman known
carnally by the King.
My sister...
- Then my daughter is...?
- Yes.
Elizabeth is to be
declared a bastard.
Madam, I swear to you I will
do everything within my power
to protect and support her,
and keep her always
in the King's good
and kind graces.
Thank you.
And now, since my
time approaches,
I beg your Grace to
hear my confession.
Also, I should like
the Constable present
when I receive the good Lord.
Madam.
My child, do you
have a confession?
Yes.
I confess my
innocence before God.
I solemnly swear,
on the damnation of my soul,
that I have never been
unfaithful to my lord and husband,
nor ever offended with
my body against him.
I do not say that I have
always borne towards him
the humility which I owed him,
considering his kindness and
the great honor he showed me
and the great respect
he always paid me.
I admit, too, that I have
often taken it into my head
to be jealous of him.
But God knows,
and is my witness,
I have not sinned against
him in any other way.
Think not I say this in
the hope to prolong my life.
God has taught me how to die,
and He will strengthen my faith.
As for my brother...
...and those others who
were unjustly condemned,
I would willingly have suffered
many deaths to deliver them,
but since I see it
pleases the King,
I will willingly
accompany them in death.
With this assurance:
that I shall lead an endless
life with them in peace.
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Master Kingston.
Please go and make sure to report
my Lady's true and last confession,
so the world will know it.
I will.
Mr. Cranmer, I do not suppose
that, even at this last hour,
the evangelical bishops that we
put in place might intervene for me?
Your Majesty, I...
No, I understand.
How could they? Forgive me.
<i>Gaudeamus omnes in Domino, per
omnia saecula saeculorum. Amen.</i>
Is it done? Is
the harlot dead?
I don't know. But, certainly,
she will be dead before very long.
The Lord is good.
Tell me: why is
she really to die?
They say that her child, Elizabeth,
was not conceived
with the King at all,
but with one of her
countless lovers.
How many lovers was
she supposed to have?
According to Mr. Cromwell,
over a hundred men,
including her brother, Rochford.
But I'm told she also blames
me for what has befallen her,
and holds me
accountable for her doom.
Naturally I am flattered
by the compliment,
since she would have thrown
me to the dogs if she could.
Tell me about this other Lady,
this Jane Seymour?
I have been told in confidence
that she is of our faith,
and that the King loves her,
and means to marry her.
And that she means to restore
your grace to the succession.
And Elizabeth will
become a bastard now?
- As I have been a bastard?
- Yes, Princess.
The brat is now
officially a bastard.
Tell them to ready the horses.
- But tell no one of our destination.
- Yes, Majesty.
To every thing
there is a season,
and a time to every
purpose under heaven.
A time to be born,
and a time to die.
A time to plant and a time to
pluck up that which is planted.
A time to weep,
and a time to laugh.
A time to cast away stones,
and a time to gather
stones together.
A time to mourn,
and a time to dance.
That which hath been is now.
And that which is to
be has already been...
A time to get,
and a time to lose.
A time to keep,
and a time to cast away.
A time to rend,
and a time to sew.
A time to keep silence,
and a time to speak.
I said in my heart, God shall judge
the righteous and the wicked,
for there is a time for
every purpose under the sun.
Am I to go now? I thought...
My Lady, forgive me...
The executioner has been
delayed on the road from Dover
and your execution is
postponed until twelve o'clock.
I wanted to tell you,
in good time, in case...
Master Kingston.
I hear you say I will
not die before noon,
and I'm sorry for it,
for I thought to be dead by
that time, and past my pain.
Madam, there will be no pain.
The blow will be so subtle.
Yes, I heard the
executioner was very good.
And in any case,
I have only a little neck.
- Edward!
- Ah!
- Ha!
- Ah!
Father?
Sir?
- HA!
- Ah!
My God.
Edward, this is not a toy.
Yes, sir.
So, have you ever
killed someone?
Yes. In battle.
What did it feel like?
He was my enemy.
I didn't care.
I would really like
to see someone die.
Can I go to the
execution with you?
How much did they
charge for the scaffold?
Twenty- three pounds, six shillings
and eight pence, Mr. Secretary.
Daylight robbery.
And what is the Headsman to
be paid, if he ever arrives?
Fifteen pounds.
Fifteen pounds?
For one stroke?
My God, he makes
a damn good living!
<i>Allons, vas- y. Allons- y.</i>
<i>On y va. Viens!</i>
-  Well, is it done?
- Uh...
Is it?
No, your Majesty.
Uh... Unfortunately,
we must postpone
the execution again.
- What?
- The Executioner was delayed.
Then you fetch somebody
else! Do you hear?
Fetch back the axman
who did the others!
He was good enough wasn't he?
He didn't botch the thing.
Your Majesty made a promise.
Why should I care about my
promises to that whore?!
Your Majesty's promise is
public knowledge. That is all...
I still don't care!
I ordered you to get someone
else! I want her dead!
I want it over with! Finished!
Go and do it or by God's
blood you will join her!
I said!
Postpone it!
Majesty.
Let's go.
Master Kingston, I am ready.
My Lady, you must
forgive me once again.
But the Executioner
is still not arrived.
What do you say?
Madam, your execution is put off
until nine o'clock tomorrow morning.
No...
No. It cannot be.
It is not that I
desire death, but I...
I thought myself prepared
to die... I was prepared.
I fear... I fear that of further
delay it may weaken my resolve.
Please... If it...
If it were possible...
No, Madam. It is the
King's express command.
No! Wait! Perhaps
I'm not meant to die.
These postponements
they mean something.
Perhaps the King
is testing me.
I'll be sent to a nunnery.
Hiya! Whou!
I am sure you
are aware, Sir John,
that my marriage has been
declared null and void.
I have been made aware of the
circumstances, your Majesty.
And, like everyone else,
I have been shocked
and utterly amazed
by what I've heard.
I am grateful.
But I must tell you...
The Privy Council,
despite these recent hurts,
have pleaded with me to venture
once more into matrimony,
in the hope that my bride
will produce a legitimate heir.
I think you know my choice
has fallen upon your daughter.
I do.
Tomorrow you will all travel
by barge to Hampton Court,
where our betrothal
will be announced.
I swear to you, Sir John, from tomorrow,
everything will be different.
We will be young and
merry as we used to be.
- Lady Jane.
- Your Majesty.
Lady Jane!
I won't wear it!
You can't make me!
No! No! I'm not going!
Lady Elizabeth, you must do
as you are told! Now hush!
Or I will hit you.
Don't look like that, girl!
We are ordered to remove the child so
she can be kept out of sight of the King.
- Little Princess.
- She is no longer a Princess.
She is a bastard. And Master Cromwell
has asked for her accounts to be settled.
Also in respect of necessities
provided for her mother in the Tower.
You mean, the child should pay
for her mother's imprisonment?
Yes. Out of the money the
King pays for her household.
Exactly.
The world is a
slippery place, my Lady.
If you would take my advice,
for what it's worth,
find a rich man to marry who is too
stupid to know anything about politics.
Then, perhaps, unless you die
in childbirth, which is likely,
or the plague, which
is almost inevitable...
then you will be happy.
What would you like to
talk about, sweetheart?
If your Majesty would allow, I should
like to talk about your daughter Mary.
When I am Queen I would hope to
see her reinstated as heir apparent.
Jane, you're a fool to hope so.
You ought to solicit
the advancement
of the children we're going
to have, not any others.
But, Your Majesty, I thought
I was asking not so much
for the good of others, as
for the good, of the repose
and tranquility of yourself,
as well as the children
we may have ourselves.
And for the tranquility
of your Majesty's kingdom.
Forgive me.
It's just that I so much
want a new beginning.
A renaissance.
Sometimes it is hard to be reminded
of things. Do you understand?
You are so pure.
I just don't want you to be affected
by things that have gone before.
May I kiss you, Jane?
Aren't you the King of England?
Everything will change for her.
That kiss is her destiny,
and her fortune.
And ours.
You know, when I was a girl, I served
at the court of Margaret of Austria.
It was a wonderful time.
Pageants and dances.
So many dances.
I once appeared as the
Queen of the Amazons,
with a naked sword in my hand,
and a crimson headdress
with a great plume!
But Margaret was wise, too.
She said to us: "Trust in
those who offer you service,
"and in the end, my maidens,
"you will find
yourself in the ranks
of those who have
been deceived."
Am I...
Am I to be tried?
No. You are to be released.
But, his Majesty commands,
that since you no longer
enjoy his trust or affection,
you are to be
stripped forthwith
of all your official
posts and titles.
You will no longer serve
on the Privy Council,
you will relinquish the
role of Lord Privy Seal,
and all its privileges.
His Majesty also desires
that you leave court.
And that you never show
yourself in his presence again
On pain of death.
So I am to keep my earldom?
Did you watch your son die?
What about your daughter?
Will you watch her suffer?
Will you watch her die?
Tell me, Boleyn:
was it all worth it?
Halt!
Do see this?
Do you know what this is?
It's the Fountain of Youth.
Look!
I am re- born!
This way, Monsieur.
I deeply regret
you were delayed.
May I see it?
Si vous voulez, Monsieur.
It's beautiful, no?
The execution is
ordered for nine o'clock.
You will be awoken two hours before,
in order for you to have breakfast.
- So, if that is all?
- No, Monsieur.
I must say a few words.
The lady must not to be
restrained in any way.
But, it is very
important that the lady
doesn't look back like this
for the fear of the sword.
Alors first, I hide the
sword so she cannot see it.
It is totally normal
they want to look around
and see where your death
come from. No? Ha! Ha!
So, when she has finished her
prayers, and is ready to go...
I say, to boy in front
of her, "Fetch my sword".
Of course the
lady looks at man.
And this is just the
perfect angle for me.
When she looks at man.
Then I strike.
Then, "Chuck!"
You understand?
I think so, yes.
Oh, it's very quick.
She feel no pain.
Monsieur?
You will be not disappointed.
I'm sure.
Thou knowest whether
I deserve this death.
Not my will O Lord,
but thine be done.
I will give glory to thy name,
for thou art my help
and my protection.
Thou hast protected
me and preserved me...
<i>Anne!</i>
<i>Anne!</i>
<i>Anne!</i>
<i>He'll get you!</i>
Madam, the hour approaches,
you must make ready.
Acquit yourself of your charge,
for I have been long prepared.
The King asks that
you take this purse.
It has twenty pounds in it,
to pay the headsman
for his services
and distribute
alms to the poor.
Thank you.
Will you and your
ladies follow me.
Master Kingston, I pray
you not to give the signal
for my death until I have spoken
what I have the mind to speak.
Madam.
Good Christian people,
I have come here to die,
according to the law,
and thus yield myself to
the will of the King, my lord.
Long live the King!
And if, in my life, I ever
did offend the King's Grace,
then surely with my
death I do now atone...
I pray and beseech you all,
to pray for the
life of the King.
God save the King!
My sovereign lord and yours,
who is one of the best princes
on the face of the earth,
who has always
treated me so well,
wherefore I submit to
death with a good will,
humbly asking pardon
of all the world.
If anyone should
take up my case,
I ask them only
to judge it kindly.
Thank you... Thank you.
Madame, forgive me
for what I must do.
Gladly.
And here is your purse.
Thus I take my
leave of the world...
- ...and of you.
- Bless you...
And I heartily desire
you all to pray for me.
Lord have mercy on you.
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not be in want.
He makes me lie down
in green pastures.
He leads me beside
quiet waters...
Jesus, receive my soul.
O Lord God, have
pity on my soul.
To Christ I commend my soul.
Jesus Christ receive my soul!
O Lord God have pity on my soul.
Jesus receive my soul.
O God have pity on
my soul, Jesus Christ.
O Lord God have
pity on my soul.
Jesus Christ receive my soul.
Thank you.
Christ receive my soul.
Jesus Christ receive my soul.
O Lord God have
pity on my soul.
To Christ I commend myself.
Jesus receive my soul.
O Lord God have pity on my soul.
To Christ I commend myself.
To Christ I commend myself.
Boy! Fetch my sword!
Make way for the
King's household.
Make way.
Make way for the
King's household.
May the Lord Jesus
be drink and food.

Saison 3 - …pisode 1

CHAPELLE ROYALE
LONDRES 1536
- Jane.
- Votre Majestť.
Nous sommes rassembler en ce jour,
devant Dieu et ces tťmoins,
pour unir par les liens du mariage,
Henry le huitiŤme,
Roi d'Angleterre et de France,
protecteur de la foi,
Chef suprÍme
de l'…glise d'Angleterre,
et Lady Jane Seymour.
Si l'un de vous
voit un quelconque obstacle
ŗ l'accomplissement de ce mariage,
qu'il le dise maintenant,
ou qu'il se taise ŗ jamais.
Merci pour ce prťsent.
Il est vraiment magnifique.
J'espŤre bientŰt vous remercier
pour le mien.
Voulez-vous danser ?
Musique.
- Je me sens coupable.
- Pourquoi ?
J'oublie parfois
comme vous Ítes jolie.
Je pense qu'elle le rendra heureux.
Si Dieu le veut,
nous tous le serons.
Nous connaissons-nous, Milady ?
 tes-vous nouvelle ŗ la cour ?
En effet. Je vais Ítre nommťe
Dame de compagnie de Sa Majestť.
- Quel est votre nom ?
- Lady Ursula Misseldon.
- Savez-vous qui je suis ?
- Sir Francis Bryan.
- J'ai entendu parler de vous.
- Et que dit-on ?
Vous aimez vous accaparer
des bateaux des autres.
J'espŤre en savoir plus sur vous,
Lady Misseldon.
Depuis que les filles du roi
ont ťtť dťclarťes
illťgitimes et inaptes ŗ rťgner,
nous devons espťrer que la reine
enfante rapidement.
Je crains qu'avec la mort d'Anne,
nous ayons perdu un grand ami
et un alliť de poids.
Si la nouvelle reine favorise
le catholicisme comme on le dit,
nos rťformes seront toutes
compromises.
Votre manque de confiance dans le roi
me surprend.
Il nous faut h‚ter
la dissolution de ces maisons closes
et supprimer ces lieux de cultes.*
Les monastŤres.
"Dieu tout-puissant et ťternel,
"accordez-nous
l'accroissement de notre foi,
"l'espťrance et la charitť.
"Et si nous arrivons ŗ obtenir
ce que tu nous as promis,
"faites-nous aimer
ce que tu nous as ordonnť
"par Jťsus Christ, Notre Seigneur."
Si je peux me permettre, j'ai...
un cadeau de mariage
pour Votre Majestť.
Il appartenait jadis
ŗ la Reine Catherine.
Sa Majestť le Roi.
…pouse.
…poux.
Je ne crois pas
votre prťsence requise.
Pas cette fois.
YORKSHIRE
NORD DE L'ANGLETERRE
Faites place !
ABBAYE DE SAWLEY
Faites place aux contrŰleurs du Roi.
- Que tout soit comptabilisť.
- Oui, Dr Frankish.
Dr Frankish,
voici une bien riche Madone.
Elle est parfaite.
Manteau de soie,
des tonnes de bijoux.
Une vraie beautť.
Eh bien, Madame,
vous Ítes nue ŗ prťsent.
M. Aske ?
Voyez ce qu'ils ont fait, John.
Regardez.
C'est l'oeuvre de Sir Cromwell.
Cromwell et cette secte
d'hťrťtiques ŗ Londres.
Ces charognards !
M. Aske, les gens ne supportent plus
de rester les bras croisťs
ŗ voir leur foi
et tout ce qui compte pour eux
leur Ítre arrachťs.
J'ai appris hier que deux
de ces contrŰleurs ont ťtť attaquťs
ŗ Lincolnshire.
Et ici dans le Yorkshire,
un homme du peuple
s'est dressť ŗ l'…glise
et a appelť ŗ suivre les Croix.
Car maintenant
qu'ils nous les ont pris,
nous ne pouvons que les suivre.
Que suis-je censť faire, John ?
Les communs, ici,
dans le Lincolnshire et partout
se prťparent ŗ se battre
pour sauver leurs acquis.
Mais ils ont besoin de meneurs.
Ils ont besoin...
d'hommes intelligents
et instruits pour les diriger.
- Je ne suis pas un meneur.
- Ne vous prťcipitez pas.
Organisons une rťunion.
Vous vous dťciderez alors.
Pour l'amour de Dieu.
Jetez un oeil ŗ cela.
Nos enquÍteurs l'ont trouvť
dans l'Abbaye de Sawley.
Comment ont-ils pu ?
Regardez par vous-mÍme.
Les gens croient que les ossements
des saints sont vivants
et qu'ils peuvent les bťnir...
s'ils ont quelques piŤces
ŗ offrir ŗ l'…glise...
et ŗ Rome.
Comment vont nos rťformes ?
Vous savez certainement
que le parlement a votť
la suppression de tous
les petits monastŤres,
et nos contrŰleurs sont ŗ la t‚che
dans tous les Comtťs d'Angleterre.
- Beaucoup d'opposition ?
- Nous en attendions plus.
Pourquoi donc ?
Les gens doivent comprendre
que tous ces monastŤres
ont ťtť condamnťs
pour leurs pÍchťs manifestes :
Une vie de plaisir et de luxure.
Une anecdote parmi tant d'autres...
Quand nos contrŰleurs ont investi
l'abbaye des Frťres de la Croix,
ils ont trouvť le curť lui-mÍme,*
ŗ la fois surpris et dťvÍtu.
Il leur a proposť de l'argent
pour qu'ils partent.
Il est vrai que les gens sont attirťs
par le contenu de ces lieux.
Ils les ont fouillťes
jusqu'ŗ ce qu'il ne reste plus rien.
Ils ont mÍme pris les livres
pour l'utiliser comme papier
pour leurs lieux d'aisances.
ņ combien s'ťlŤvent les gains
pour le Trťsor du Roi ?
Selon mes prťvisions,
nous avons doublť les entrťes du Roi.
L'appropriation des terres
des monastŤres nous a rapportť
... des millions de livres.
Des millions ?
En effet, M. le Secrťtaire.
Sir Edward Seymour.
Sir Edward,
en tant que frŤre de l'ťpouse
bien-aimťe de Sa Majestť,
Sa Majestť consent ŗ vous faire
Vicomte Beauchamp de Hache,
dans le Somerset,
mais aussi Gouverneur de Jersy,
et Chancelier du nord
du Pays de Galles.
Je suis profondťment honorť,
Votre Majestť.
Et j'assure Votre Majestť
que j'oeuvrerais inexorablement
pour ses intťrÍts.
Dans l'espoir de mťriter la confiance
que vous me montrez.
Voici vos lettres patentes.
Je vous fťlicite
pour votre promotion.
Thomas.
Qu'y a-t-il d'autre ?
Votre Majestť a reÁu
une lettre de l'Empereur.
Vous fťlicitant pour votre mariage.
Comme il ne voit plus
d'autres entraves, il est soucieux
- de parvenir ŗ un accord.
- Parfait. Quoi d'autre ?
Lady Mary a ťgalement ťcrit
ŗ Votre Majestť...
Que veut-elle ?
Elle dit qu'il est temps
d'oublier le triste passť.
Elle supplie de reprendre place
ŗ vos yeux.
Et elle vous rappelle humblement
qu'elle n'est qu'une femme...
et votre enfant.
Je ne lui pardonnerai jamais.
Pas avant qu'elle ne se soumette
au sujet du mariage avec sa mŤre
and surprint.*
Vous enverrez un ťmissaire.
Pour que j'oublie le triste passť,
elle devra d'abord le dťsavouer.
Valet !
Sir Francis !
J'ai de bonnes nouvelles pour vous.
Sa Majestť a acceptť votre nomination
comme membre de la Chambre.
Je devrais sŻrement
vous remercier pour cela.
Voyez-vous, j'ai une mission
ŗ vous confier.
Excellence !
Suivez-moi. J'aimerais
vous prťsenter quelqu'un.
Reine Jane,
laissez-moi vous prťsenter
Son Excellence Eustache Chapuis.
Ambassadeur de l'empereur
Charles V d'Espagne.
Excellence.
Je vous laisse converser en privť.
Je vous fťlicite pour votre mariage,
et vous souhaite santť et prospťritť.
Bien que le devenir de la dame
qui vous a prťcťdťe ťtait...
des plus heureux,
je suis persuadť que c'est vous
qui aurez ŗ rťaliser cet objectif.
Merci, Excellence.
L'Empereur sera ravi de voir
une reine aussi vertueuse
et aimable
prendre place sur le TrŰne.
Je dois vous dire qu'il me sera
impossible de surfaire
la joie et le bonheur
que les Anglais tťmoignent
au sujet de votre mariage.
Surtout qu'il est dit
que vous Ítes une pacifiste.
Tentant continuellement
de persuader le Roi de restaurer
sa fille Mary dans ses positions.
Je vous promets, Excellence,
que je continuerai
ŗ prendre soin de Lady Mary,
et ferais mon possible pour mťriter
le titre de pacifiste que vous m'avez
obligeamment octroyť.
Dans ce cas, je pense
que vous constaterez
qu'en vous prťservant de la douleur
d'un accouchement,
vous gagnerez un trťsor de fille,
qui vous apportera plus de satisfaction
que vos propres enfants.
Je ne peux que rťitťrer
que je ferais de mon mieux
pour restaurer la paix
entre le Roi et sa fille ainťe.
Vous Ítes le 1er ambassadeur
qu'elle reÁoit.
Elle n'a pas l'habitude
de pareilles audiences.
Mais ce qui se dit est vrai.
Elle est gentille et aimable,
et trŤs encline ŗ la paix.
Par exemple,
elle ferait l'impossible
pour ťviter que j'entre en guerre
rien que pour ťpargner
la douleur d'une sťparation.
Une guerre, Votre Majestť ?
Contre qui ?
Ce ne sont que des suppositions.
Vous en auriez sŻrement
fait de mÍme.
YORKSHIRE
NORD DE L'ANGLETERRE
Merci d'Ítre venu.
Mes amis ! Mes amis.
Nous sommes ici
pour que vous ťcoutiez et parliez
ŗ cet homme bon
qu'est M. Robert Aske.
Certains d'entre vous le connaissent
comme l'avocat du Duc de Northampton.
Il a toujours ťtť honnÍte et impartial
dans sa conduite avec les communs.
M. Aske peut prendre la parole.
- Mesdames et Messieurs.
- Bonsoir...
Dites-moi ce que vous voulez tous.
Toutes nos fÍtes religieuses
ont ťtť abolies.
Plairait-il ŗ Sa Majestť
de nous les rendre ?
Nous voulons que les abbayes
soient restaurťes, et demandons
que cette avancťe de l'hťrťsie
s'arrÍte. Que les nouveaux
ťvÍques hťrťtiques,
tels que Cranmer, soient ťcartťs.
De mÍme, Cromwell...
devra Ítre remplacť par un noble.
On dit que de nouvelles taxes
nous seront imposťes.
Sur notre bťtail et nos baptÍmes.
Sur nos mariages et nos naissances !
Ils ont mÍme dťtruit nos paroisses,
et volť tous leurs trťsors.
Bien, messieurs.
Et que comptez-vous faire
pour les arrÍter ?
Nos terres et nos biens
ont ťtť accaparťs
par les contrŰleurs de l'…glise.
Nous nous battrons !
Et nous mourrons !
Jusqu'au dernier d'entre nous !
Je comprends votre colŤre.
La destruction des abbayes
est tragique et criminelle,
car leur prťsence reprťsente
un modŤle inconditionnel
pour chacun de nous.
Mais...
cette incitation ŗ prendre les armes
et ŗ se rebeller contre le Roi
est une chose
que je ne peux cautionner.
Comme le Roi
est notre corps et notre ‚me,
se battre contre lui serait se battre
contre toute la communautť,
et contre Dieu, lui-mÍme.
Vous avez entendu ? La noblesse
ne se prťoccupe guŤre de nous.
Le Christ est mort pour les pauvres.
Vous en souvenez-vous, M. Aske ?
Lady Ursula Misseldon,
Votre Majestť.
Lady Misseldon.
Votre Majestť.
Accomplissez vos t‚ches
de faÁon honorable et vertueuse.
Souvenez-vous, vous vous Ítes engagťes
ŗ servir et obťir.
Lady Rochford.
Je vous en prie.
J'ai demandť ŗ vous voir.
Je sais que rien ne va plus
depuis que votre ťpoux a ťtť
... exťcutť.
J'ai ťtť totalement abandonnťe.
Je suis condamnťe en raison
des agissements de George.
M. Cromwell a refusť
de donner rťponse ŗ mes lettres.
Rien n'est de votre faute.
George Boleyn a subi
les consťquences de ses actes.
Revenez ŗ la cour.
Je vous dťsigne comme
ma principale Dame de compagnie.
J'espŤre que vous accepterez
cette fonction.
Merci, Votre Majestť.
ņ prťsent, Lady Rochford,
tout ira pour le mieux.
Tout est pardonnť.
Sir Francis Bryan, Milady.
Je suis ravie que vous soyez venu.
J'ai ťcrit une lettre
fťlicitant le Roi pour son mariage.
L'implorant de m'autoriser
ŗ servir la Reine
ou d'effectuer n'importe qu'elle t‚che
qu'elle voudrait me confier.
Je ne suis pas ici
pour parler de mondanitťs.
Sa Majestť
vous ordonne de signer cela.
- Qu'est-ce donc ?
- Une liste d'articles
reconnaissant
que le Roi est le Chef de l'…glise
et que son union ŗ votre mŤre
est incestueuse et illťgale.
Vous devez aussi renoncer ŗ Rome
et reconnaitre librement
votre illťgitimitť.
Si vous refusez de signer,
je crains que M. Cromwell
ne puisse garantir votre sťcuritť.
Malgrť tout l'amour
que je porte ŗ mon pŤre,
et tous les efforts que je ferais
pour lui Ítre agrťable,
je ne peux risquer
la damnation de mon ‚me
pour les faveurs d'un roi mortel.
Vous Ítes une fille ingrate !
Puisque vous refusez
de vous soumettre ŗ votre pŤre,
il devra vous condamner
pour trahison.
C'est impossible !
- Je refuse de le croire !
- …coutez-moi bien.
Je vous le dis,
si vous ťtiez ma fille,
j'ťcraserai votre tÍte contre le mur
jusqu'ŗ ce qu'elle soit
aussi molle qu'une pomme bouillie.
Comprenez-vous ?
Nous avons convenu du programme
de votre couronnement avec M. Holbein.
- Connaissez-vous le Centre de Venise ?
- Non, Votre Majestť.
C'est un bateau que les Doges empruntent
chaque annťe pour traverser le lagon
afin de cťlťbrer
leur union avec la mer.
C'est une oeuvre magnifique,
faite d'or avec des statues
en bronze
reprťsentant Neptune, lions de mer
et autres crťatures fantastiques.
Je vais le construire.
Et il vous conduira
de Greenwich jusqu'ŗ Londres,
oý vous serez sacrťe
Reine Jane d'Angleterre.
Votre Majestť, je ne sais quoi dire.
Vous n'avez rien ŗ dire.
Ce couronnement
sera le plus fabuleux
qu'une reine d'Angleterre
n'ait jamais connu.
Je vous le promets.
Votre Majestť, pardonnez-moi.
Mais, j'ai appris que vous aviez engagť
des poursuites contre Lady Mary.
De tout mon coeur,
je vous implore d'y renoncer.
Avez-vous perdu l'esprit ?
Ne parlez plus jamais de cela.
J'ai un autre cadeau pour vous.
J'espŤre qu'il vous plaira.
Merci, Votre Majestť.
Je l'adore, il est si mignon !
- Lady Misseldon.
- Sir Francis.
J'espŤre ne pas
vous avoir fait peur ?
Votre billet disait
que vous vouliez me voir ?
Oui, en effet.
ņ quel sujet ?
Je me demandais si vous vouliez
devenir ma maÓtresse.
Sir, je vais bientŰt me marier.
Avec qui ?
Sir Robert Tavistock.
Pourra-t-il vous offrir
de pareils prťsents ?
Je ne crois pas.
Si votre virginitť vous importe tant,
gardez-la, pour ce qu'elle vaut.
Je jure alors de ne plus
vous importuner
ni d'importuner votre conscience.
Je ne me suis pas dťcidťe.
Comment puis-je renoncer ŗ Rome
ou au mariage de ma mŤre.
AprŤs tout ce qu'elle a subi.
Je comprends.
Mais puis-je vous suggťrer
de signer le document.
Par la suite, vous pourrez faire
"une exception de protestation."
Qui est d'abjurer secrŤtement
votre soumission
- devant tťmoins.
- N'est-ce pas de l'hypocrisie ?
L'Empereur dťsapprouverait sŻrement
que je signe ce document.
Et le Saint-PŤre, aussi.
Lady Mary,
je dois honnÍtement vous dire
que l'Empereur ne dťsire plus
intervenir dans cette affaire.
AprŤs tout, vous n'Ítes pas
un de ses sujets.
Et comme il recherche
une nouvelle alliance avec le Roi,
il serait des plus rťticents
ŗ l'offenser d'une quelconque maniŤre.
Dans ce cas,
je suis seule ?
Qu'arrivera-t-il si je refuse ?
Il est fort possible que le Roi
vous condamne ŗ mort.
Bien.
Ne voulez-vous pas le lire ?
Je vous demande seulement
de prier pour mon absolution.
Tant que je vivrais,
je prťserverai mon ‚me.
CHATEAU DE GANDOLPHO
RESIDENCE D'ETE DU PAPE, ITALIE
PŤre Pole ?
Oui, Votre …minence.
Je suis le Cardinal Von Waldburg.
Combien de temps Ítes-vous
restť au sťminaire ŗ Rome ?
Presque une annťe, …minence.
J'ai quittť l'Angleterre
quand il est devenu clair que le Roi
allait briser son allťgeance
ŗ Rome et au Saint-PŤre.
La mort de cette catin d'Anne Boleyn
est providentielle.
Sa Saintetť prie
pour que le Roi Henry profite
de cette divine opportunitť
de rťconciliation.
Un seul geste d'obťissance ŗ Rome,
aussi minime soit-il,
lui permettra d'ťchapper
ŗ la menace d'excommunion.
Croyez-moi, Votre …minence,
tous les gens pieux d'Angleterre
prient pour cela.
Ma mŤre, Lady Salisbury m'a ťcrit
qu'elle croit que la nouvelle Reine
est au fond une vraie catholique.
Votre mŤre pourrait faire plus
qu'espťrer.
Et vous mÍme pŤre Pole,
pourriez envisager
votre retour en Angleterre,
afin d'influencer les ťvťnements.
Voyez-vous, PŤre Pole,
je sais qui vous Ítes vraiment.
"Ici est la vťritable Danae.
"Elle pourrait enflammer
votre passion
"jusqu'au plus haut point.
"Un seul contact...
"un simple contact de son corps,
"et vos membres
fondraient dans le feu."
Ce collier vous va bien,
et vous Ítes adorable.
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.
Ave Maria, gratia plena,
Dominus tecum.
Votre Majestť a reÁu une lettre
de Lady Bryan,
gouvernante de Lady Elizabeth.
Il semblerait que l'enfant
soit ŗ court de vÍtements.
Lady Bryan demande si Sa Majestť
- permettrait qu'elle en ait d'autres.
- Pourquoi le ferais-je ?
Elle n'est pas de moi.
Tous savent que son pŤre
ťtait ce traÓtre d'Henry Norris
et sa mŤre une catin.
Quoi d'autre ?
Il y a ceci...
La soumission...
de Lady Mary.
Convenez d'une entrevue avec elle.
Loin d'ici et non en public.
Nous nous rendrons ŗ sa rťsidence.
Il y a des rumeurs
d'ťpidťmie dans la ville.
Le couronnement devra Ítre reportť.
M. Rich m'a montrť les comptes.
Je suis trŤs satisfait, Tom.
Je vous le prouverai bientŰt.
Lady Rochford.
- Oui, Votre Majestť.
- Portez ceci ŗ Lady Bryan.
Qu'elle achŤte ŗ Elizabeth
de quoi se vÍtir.
Nous devrons penser
ŗ un cadeau pour Lady Mary.
J'ai tellement h‚te
de la rencontrer.
Votre Majestť est trŤs gentille.
Lady Rochford, vous n'Ítes pour rien
dans la trahison de votre ťpoux.
Comme Mary et Elizabeth n'ont pas
choisi d'Ítre les filles du roi.
Les femmes sont souvent exploitťes.
Mon voeu est de les protťger
du mieux que je peux.
Je dois rester discrŤte.
Mais je le ferais quand mÍme.
Et je compte sur votre aide.
Oui, Votre Majestť.
- Ton nom, mon garÁon ?
- Charlie, Sir.
Charlie Roll.
- Mťtier ?
- Berger.
M. Le Secrťtaire Cromwell.
ņ genoux.
Sais-tu ce que nous avons ŗ faire ?
Oui, capitaine Aske.
Nous ne sommes pas des rebelles,
mais des pŤlerins.
Et nous avons un pŤlerinage ŗ faire.
Si tu veux te joindre ŗ nous,
il faudra prÍter serment devant Dieu,
l'…glise catholique,
notre souverain le Roi,
et les communs de ce royaume.
Et que Dieu te vienne en aide.
Je jure.
Porte ce badge.
Il reprťsente
les 5 plaies du Christ,
afin de prouver que les communs
se battent pour sa cause.
Oui, capitaine.
Dieu te protŤge.
Sir Thomas Cromwell, je te fais,
Baron Cromwell de Wimbledon,
et depuis ce jour,
garde des Sceaux.
Ton bras, fils.
Dieu te protŤge.
Sa Majestť est trop bonne.
Ces cadeaux ne sont rien
devant ceux du coeur.
J'ai beaucoup de plaisir ŗ vous voir
rťconcilier avec votre pŤre.
Voici plus de 1000 couronnes.
Si vous avez besoin d'autre chose,
vous n'avez qu'ŗ le demander.
Merci, Votre Majestť.
PŤre...
PŤre.
Mary ťtait si douce et affectueuse.
Elle est telle que je l'espťrais.
Il n'est pas surprenant qu'elle soit
apprťciťe pour sa vertu et sa bontť.
Sa Majestť devrait l'inviter
ŗ la cour et la prťsenter.
Pourquoi ne dites-vous rien ?
Je suis dťÁu.
Pourquoi ?
Car vous n'Ítes pas enceinte.
Milord ! Milord !
Nous sommes venus en toute h‚te
vous dire que la majoritť du nord
ainsi qu'une partie du Lincolnshire
se sont rťvoltťs contre Sa Majestť.
Partout, les communs se rassemblent.
Les balises de la rťvolte
s'enflamment sur toutes les collines.
Voilŗ 4 jours, pendant
que nous collections les taxes
nous avons ťtť attaquťs
par une foule en colŤre.
Ils ont capturť un des contrŰleurs
appelť Nicholas Bello,
l'ont fait tomber de son cheval
et battu ŗ mort.
Parmi ces gens, nous avons aperÁu
des prÍtres en armes,
incitant les rebelles
en criant : Tuez-les ! Tuez-les !
Un autre homme, William Lichie,
connu comme ťtant ŗ votre service
M. Cromwell,
a ťtť pendu ŗ un arbre.
Et que veulent donc ces rebelles ?
D'aprŤs ce que j'ai compris,
ils veulent prťserver
leurs fÍtes religieuses,
leurs monastťres restaurťs,
leurs ťglises respectťes...
et une rťduction des taxes.
Je les ai entendus dire
que s'ils rťussissaient,
ils avaient pour but de vous tuer,
M. Cromwell,
ainsi que 4 ou 5 …vÍques
et le Chancelier Rich,
en tant qu'instigateurs du vol
et de la dissolution des ťglises.
Pourquoi la noblesse n'a rien fait
pour arrÍter ces traÓtres ?
Ils ne pensent qu'ŗ protťger
leurs terres et leurs biens.
Ils ont essayť,
mais les rebelles sont revenus
en plus grand nombre.
Ce ne sont plus des centaines,
mais plutŰt des milliers,
menant une rťbellion
contre les rťformes de l'…glise.
Comment osez-vous l'ignorer ?
Vous Ítes censť tout savoir.
Au contraire, vous disiez
qu'il y avait peu d'opposition.
Vous disiez que la plupart des gens
voudraient voir ces lieux dissous.
Vous aviez tort !
Vous ne saviez rien.
Escroc !
Asseyez-vous et ťcrivez ce qui suit.
"Nous considťrons
comme dťsobligeant
"que des sujets infťrieurs se soient
rťvoltťs contre nous sans motif aucun.
"La confiscation des biens des paroisses
n'a jamais ťtť recherchťe.
"Et mÍme si c'ťtait le cas,
"de loyaux sujets n'auraient jamais
osť en dťbattre avec leur rťgent,
"d'une maniŤre aussi violente,
"mais l'auraient consultť
ŗ ce sujet.
"A prťsent, je vous ordonne
"de rentrer chez vous,
et de ne plus dire mot
"Souvenez-vous de votre allťgeance.
"Vous avez prÍtť serment
d'obťir ŗ votre Roi,
"tant par injonction divine,
"que par la loi de la nature."
Tous les communs
sont engagťs ensemble.
Le moment est venu de se lever
ou jamais ne le sera.
Alors, marchons.
Marchons vers York.
Marchons sous peine de mort.
Marchons au nom de Dieu.
Marchons !
J'ťcris ŗ la noblesse de Yorkshire.
Les rappelant leur obligation
de maÓtriser ces traitres,
et les consťquences de leur ťchec.
N'y a-t-il pas moyen...
de suspendre le travail
des enquÍteurs
- jusqu'ŗ ce que la rťvolte...
- Non.
Le seul moyen pour que
l'autoritť du Roi ťcrase
les tÍtes de ces gens du Nord
est de leur montrer
que le Roi entend
continuer les rťformes
et assainir la religion
quoi qu'ils disent.
Quoi qu'ils fassent.
Les rebelles ont pris Lincoln.
Leur drapeau flotte au-dessus
des portes de la ville.
Ils sont plus nombreux
et se dirigent vers York.
Que Dieu nous vienne en aide.
ņ 5 ans, ma mŤre et moi
avons ťtť conduits ŗ la Tour.
Il y avait une rťvolte
contre mon pŤre.
Les rebelles cornouaillais
ťtaient aux murs de la ville.
ņ l'intťrieur,
la panique rťgnait partout.
La peur...
Nous n'avions plus de nouvelles
de l'armťe royale et de mon pŤre.
Ma mŤre s'efforÁait de rester calme.
Elle ťtait terrifiait.
Et moi aussi.
J'ťtais persuadť
que nous allions Ítre tuťs.
Je te dťsigne
ŗ la tÍte des Forces royales.
Rends-toi dans le Nord.
Tu trouveras armes et provisions,
mais ne t'y attardes pas.
Je ferai selon les ordres
de Votre Majestť et bien plus.
Ces rebelles sont des traitres,
Charles.
Emplis d'intentions malveillantes.
Nous devons les punir.
Pour avoir osť se rebeller
contre leur souverain.
Tout comme mon pŤre
a puni les Cornouaillais.
- Que se passe-t-il, Charles ?
- Laissez-nous.
Oui, Votre Gr‚ce.
Sa Majestť m'a ordonnť
de mener son armťe
contre les rebelles du Nord.
Ne vous inquiťtez pas.
J'ai assez d'armes et d'hommes
pour les neutraliser
... facilement.
Sa Majestť me l'a promis.
Je prie Dieu
qu'il tienne promesse.
Je suis heureux
d'accepter cette mission.
Cromwell va endosser
la responsabilitť de tout cela.
Et les rebelles exigent sa tÍte.
Avec l'aide de Dieu,
je serai en mesure
de la leur procurer.
Le Garde des Sceaux.
J'ai envoyť Suffolk
ŗ la tÍte de l'armťe royale.
Et s'il le faut, j'enverrai la 2e armťe
pour dťtruire ces rebelles.
Oui, Votre Majestť.
ņ moins qu'ils ne se rendent,
et remettent au Duc de Suffolk
une centaine de leurs chefs,
cordes autour de leurs cous,
il aura alors
ma permission de brŻler,
et dťtruire tous leurs biens,
afin qu'ils soient un exemple
pour tous nos sujets.
Oui, Votre Majestť.
S'ils ne se rendent pas,
malgrť cela,
je promets de tous les dťtruire,
femmes et enfants.
Comprenez-vous ?
Je les dťtruirai tous.
Puis, je vous dťtruirai, Cromwell.

- Jane.
- Your majesty.
We are come here together
Before god and these witnesses
To join in holy matrimony henry viii,
King of england and france,
Defender of the faith, Supreme
head of the church of england,
And the lady jane seymour.
And if there be any among you
Who may imagine some impediments
As to why they should not be married,
Let them now speak out,
Or forever hold their tongue.
Thank you for my gift,
it's so very beautiful.
I soon trust to thank you for mine.
Shall we join in the dance.
Music.
- I feel guilty.
- Why.
Because sometimes i forget
about how beautiful you are.
I think she'll make him happy.
God's help, we'll all be happy now.
I don't recognize you, my lady.
- Are you new at court?
- Yes, sir.
I am to be a maid to her majesty.
What's your name?
Lady ursula misseldon.
You know who i am?
You're sir francis bryan.
I've heard about you.
What have you heard?
You like to board other man's boats.
I trust that i shall be seeing
A lot more of you, lady misseldon.
Since both the king's daughters Have
been declared illegimate and unfit to rule,
We must trust the queen
to conceive a child quickly.
I still fear, with anne's death,
We've lost a great friend
and a powerful supporter.
If the new queen favors
the catholic religion,
As she is rumored to do,
Then our whole reformation
is surely in jeopardy.
What a suprise, You have
such little faith in the king.
Unless we press ahead the
dissalution of those brothels
And slaughter whores of the conscience.
The monasteries.
In nomine patris,
- et filii,et spiritus sancti. Amen
- Almighty and everlasting god
give onto us the increase of faith
- Hope and charity.???
- and that we may obtain
that which thou dost promise,
Make us to love that which thou dost
command Through jesus christ, our lord.
Amen.
Madam,
if i may, I have a
wedding gift for your majesty.
It once belonged to queen katherine.
Thank you.
His majesty, the king.
Wife.
Husband.
I don't think we need
to proceed in public.
Not this time.
- Majesty.
- Majesty.
Yorkshire Northern England
Make way!
Sawley Abbey
Make way, the king's commissioners.
- Be assure everything is accounted for.
- Yes, dr. Frankish.
Dr. Frankish, here's a wealthy madonna.
Here is a fine one.
Coat of silk, ton of
jewels, wealth property.
Well, lady,
Are you stripped now?
Mr. Aske.
Look what they've done, john.
Just look.
It's all cromwell's doing.
Cromwell and that sect of
heretics in london, That bustard.
I'll tell you this mr. Aske, people,
They're no longer willing to stand by,
And watch their faith, And
everything that they care for,
Being stripped away.
I heard just yesterday,
That two of cromwell's commisioners
were attacked In lincolnshire.
And here in yorkshire,
And a man of the commons
Stood up in his own church
And said go away to follow the crosses.
For what they've taken from us,
We can follow them no more.
What am i supposed to do, john?
The commons here,
in lincolnshire, everywhere.
They're prepared to fight,
To save what they love.
But they need captains,
They need clever,
educated man to lead them.
- I'm no leader, john.
- Don't decide now.
We'll call a meeting,
Then decide.
For the love of god.
Take a look at that.
Our commisioners found it in sawly abbey.
How was it done?
See it yourself.
People thought the
saint's bones were alive
Use it work for benedictions.
If they pay a little money
they had to the church
and to rome. How do
our reforms progress?
As you know, my lord.
Parliament has now voted for the suppression
Of all the small monastery houses
And the commisioners are upon
and about their businesses
In nearly every county in england...
much opposition?
Not as much as we might have expected.
Why should we have expected it?
People conceive for themselves
That all these houses should be condemned
For their manifest sin:
carnal and abundable living.
I was told, one anecdote among many.
When our commisioners entered the
london houses of the crossed friars
They found the prayer himself,
in babel disorder.
Both stunned and naked.
They often bribes to go away.
It is true that ordinary people
are so greedy Upon these houses
when they are suppressed.
They scavenge in the night
and day untill nothing is left.
They even take the books, to use
for paper in their houses of easement.
How about the gains of king's treasure?
So far, by my reckoning,We have
already doubled the king's income
And taken in possesion of the monastic
lands Worth many millions of pounds.
Millions?
Yes, mr. Secretary.
Sir edward seymour.
Sir edward,
As the brother of his
majesty's beloved wife, jane,
It is his majesty's
pleasure today to creat you
Viscount beauchamp of hache in somerset,
Also to appoint you a governor of jersy
And chancellor of north wales.
Your majesty, i'm deeply honoured.
And i assure your majesty
that i would labor Unremittingly
in your majesty's interest,
In the hope of repaying the
great trust you've shown in me.
My lord,
here are your letters patent.
May i congratulate you on your elevation.
Mr. Secratary.
Thomas, what are the businesses there?
Your majesty has received
a letter from the emperor,
Congratulating your new marriage.
Since he's no further impediment,
He's very anxious to
become a new accommodation.
Good. What else?
The lady mary has also
written to you, majesty.
What does she want?
She writes, that it is time now
to forget the unhappy past,
She begs to be taken by
your majesty's forgiveness
And humbly beseeches you to remember
That i am a humbled woman and your child.
I'll never take her back.
Not until she first submit herself to me
The subject of his mother's
marriage and surprint.
You'll send the delegation
If she trully wants to
forget the unhappy past,
Then she can stop by signing it.
- Majesty.
- Groom.
Ah, sir francis.
I have some good news for you.
His majesty has agreed to your appointment
As a gentleman of the privy chamber.
I'm sure i know. Thanks for that.
I may have a small job for you, soon.
- Excellency.
- Your majesty.
Come with me.
There's someone i wish to present you to.
Queen jane.
Allow me to introduce his
excellency eustace chapuys,
Ambassador to the emperor
charles v, spain.
Excellency.
I leave you to talk in private.
Your majesty,
may i congratulate on your marriage.
Wish you good health and prosperity.
Although the device of the lady
who proceeded you On the
throne was the most happy.
I have no doubt that it is you,
yourself who will realise that mortal.
Thank you, excellency.
I know that the emperor will
rejoice of Such a virtual ascent
and amiable queen on the throne.
I must tell you it would be impossible
for me to overstate the joy
And happiness which each englsih men
that i have met Have expressed
to me on hearing of your marriage.
Especially, as it is said,
that you're a peace-Maker
who'll be continually Trying to persuade his
majesty to restore his daughter mary to favor.
I promise you, excellency.
That i would continue to
show favor to the lady mary.
And do my best to deserve
the title of peace-Maker
You so gallantly have given me.
If you do so,
i think you'll find madam that Without
the pain of labour, and childbirth,
You'll gain a treasure of the daughter
Who may please you even more
Than your own children by the king.
I can only say again, excellency.
That i will do my best to restore the peace
Between the king and his eldest daughter.
- Ambassordor.
- Madam.
Madam.
You're the first ambassordor she's received.
She is not yet used to see such audiences.
But it is true what they say.
She is kind and amiable,
And much inclined towards peace.
I swear, for example,
She would strive to prevent me
taking part in a foreign war.
If only to avoid the fear
and pain of separation.
If you are on war, your
majesty, against whom?
I was talking hypothetically.
Surely you'll do that
youself, your excellency.
Thanks for coming.
Thank you.
Friends! Friends.
We've come here, so you
can listen to and talk to
This good man, mr. Robert aske.
Now some of you have already known him,
He is the duke of
northampton's legal man.
He's always been honest and fair minded
In these dealings with the commons so...
mr. Aske can speak for himself.
- Ladies and(evening???) gentlmen.
- evening.
Now, tell me what is your want.
Mr aske,
all of our faith days
were abolished and gone.
Should it pleased the king's grace
that we might have our holy days back.
We want our abbeyes restored.
And demand that this
advance of heresy be halted.
We want this new heretic bishop
like cranmer be casted off.
Even cromwell to besurplanted
by man of noble birth.
We hear rumors, mr. Aske,
that new taxes levy's against us
On our cattle, and our christenings
On our marriages, and our births.
Aske,they even destroy our perish
churches and steal our treasures.
All right, gentlemen.
All right, gentlemen.
What do you reckon you
can do to stop them.
Mr. Aske,
before our lands,
our good to their houses
Are taken from by the church
commissioners. We'll fight.
And we'll die,
die after full ultimate, mr. Aske.
I know you are angry.
The destruction of the abbeys
is a terrible and criminal thing.
Since that represents by that very
presence and exotic ideal to of all of us.
But gentlemen, this call to arms,
to rebellion against the king's grace
Is something which are my
conscience i cannot agree to.
Since the king is our body and soul.
Then an attack upon him is an attack
upon the commonwealth and upon god himself.
Did you hear that, my mates
The gentry doesn't care for us.
Christ die for the poor.
Do you remember that, mr. Aske?
Lady misseldon, your majesty.
Lady misseldon.
Your majesty.
Do your duties honournably and virtuesly?
And remember, you are
all bound to serve and obey.
Lady rochford.
Your majesty.
Please.
I ask to see you.
I know that the things
have not gone well for you
since your husband was executed.
I have been utterly abandoned.
I feel i was condemed
because of what george did.
Even mr cromwell has
refused to answer my letters.
Nothing was your fault.
George bolyen was his own keeper.
I want you to come back to court.
And i'd like to appoint you
my principal lady in waiting.
I hope you'll accept this position.
Thank you, your majesty.
Well then, lady rochford.
All is well again.
All is mended up.
HUNSDOND HOUSE
HERTFORDSHIRE
Sir francis bryan, my lady.
- Lady mary.
- my lord.
I'm very glad you've come to see me.
I've written a letter congratulating
the king on his marriage.
And begging leave to
wait upon queen jane.
Or do her grace such services
would please her to command me.
I'm afraid, lady mary. I've not
come here to discuss pleasentaries.
His majesty urged
you to sign this.
What is it?
A list of articles.
Recognising the king
as head of the church,
And your mother's marriage
just incestuous and unlawful.
You must also renounce rome
and free acknowledged
of your illegitamacy.
If you not sign,
i'm afraid mr secretary cromwell
can not guarantee your safety.
However much i love
my father, your grace.
And would do anything to please
and satisfy him, i still cannot
risk my mortal soul for
the favor of an unearthly king.
You're an unfitlial daughter.
Since you're not submit
to your father.
He may yet procceed
against you for treason.
No, no he would not.
I cannot believe it.
Listen to me.
I tell you
If you're my daugher,
I would smash your
head against the wall,
until it is soft
as a boiled apple.
Do you understand?
Lady mary.
I've been discussing plans for
your coronation with mr. Holbein.
Have you ever heard
of the centre of Venice?
No, your majesty.
It's a ship.
In which the doge travels out
Into the lagoon every year
to renew its marriage while the sea.
It's a magnificant thing.
The dawn will gold and bronze, statues,
meptune, sea lions and
other fantastic sea creatures...
and i'm going to build it.
And you're going go travel in it,
from greenwich to the city,
Where you'll be crowned,
queen jane of england.
Your majesty,
i... i don't know what to say.
You don't have to say anything.
It will be the most
fabulous coronation
Any english queen has ever had
That i promise you.
Your majesty.
Forgive me.
But i've heard your majesty Make
some proceedings against the lady mary.
With all my heart
i beg you not to.
Are you out of your senses?
Don't talk of such matters again.
Jane,
I have another wedding gift for you.
I hope you like it.
Thank you your majesty.
Oh i love him,
he's so pretty.
Lady misseldon.
Sir francis.
I hope i didn't alarm you.
No sir.
You left me a note that
you wanted to see me?
Yes, i did.
About what.
I was wondering
If you'd like to become my mistress.
Sir, i'm already
engage to be married.
To whom?
Sir robert tavistock.
Can he afford to buy you gifts-
like this?
I didn't think so.
But if it's more important to you
to keep your virgin then
keep it for what it's worth.
And i swear i wouldn't bother you
or your conscience ever again.
I haven't decided yet.
How can i renounce rome?
Or my mother's marriage.
After all of my mother's sufferings.
I understand.
But may i suggest that
you could sign the document.
And then make what is
called a protestation apart.
That is secretly foresware
your submission before witnesses.
Is that not hypocrisy?
Surely the emperor's against
my signing such a document.
And the holy father.
Lady mary,
I must tell you in honesty that-
that the emperor's no longer inclined
to Interfere any further in this matter.
After all,
you are not his subject and-
and since he is seeking
a new alliance with the king,
He would in truth be most reluctant
to offend him in any way.
Then,
i'm on my own?
What if i do not sign it?
It is very possible that
the king would put you to death.
Well,
- Do you...do you not want to read it first?
- No.
Only i ask if you can pray
for absolution for what i've done.
So long as i live,
I will never forgive myself.
CASTLE GANDOLPHO
POPE'S SUMMER RESODEMCE. ITALY
Father pole.
Yes your eminence.
I'm cardinal von waldburg.
How long have you been as
the servant adhere in rome, father pole?
Almost a year your eminence.
I left england when
to became clear that
the king meant to break his obedience
to see of roman, our holy father.
The death of whore anne
boleyn is perhaps providential.
And his holiness prays
that king henry would
grasp this divine opportunity
for reconciliation.
Just one gesture,
Of he sounds to see
of rome, however small,
Will allow him to leave
the threat of excommunication.
Your eminence believe me,
That is something that the faithful
of england are praying for.
My mother, lady salisbury
has written to me,
expressing her hope
that the new queen is
in her heart a true catholic.
Perhaps your mother
could do more than hope.
And perhaps you
yourself father pole
might've considering returning
to england.
In order to influence events there.
You see, father pole,
I know who you really are.
Here is the real danae
She would kindle
your lust even higher.
One touch,
one mere touch of her body,
And your limbs will
melt in the fire.
The necklace suits you,
And you're adored.
YORKSHIRE
In nomine patris, et filii,
et spiritus sancti. Amen.
Ave maria, gratia plena,
dominus tecum.
Your majesty has received
a letter from lady bryan,
Governors to the lady elizabeth.
Apparently the child has
outgrown her clothes.
Lady bryan asks if your majesty
would permit Her to purchase new ones.
Why should i-
i don't believe she is my child.
The whole world knows their father's a traitor
henry norris and their mother was a whore.
What else?
There's letters,
the submission of the lady mary.
You will make arrangements for myself
and the queen to meet with her.
Not here and not publicly.
We will go to her residence.
There're rumors
of plague in the city.
Coronation would have
to be postponed.
Your majesty.
Thomas.
Mr.Richard showed me the figures.
I'm very pleased with you tom.
I will shortly prove it.
Lady rochford.
Yes, your majesty.
Take this to lady bryan,
Tell her to use it buy clothes
for the lady elisabeth.
Yes, madam.
And you must think of
a gift for the lady mary.
I'm looking so forward
to meeting her.
Your majesty is very kind.
Lady rochford,
it's not your fault that
your husband betrayed you.
Nor is it mary's fault or elizabeth's
fault to be born of a king.
Women are much put
upon in this world.
It's my desire as much as
i can to promote their interests.
I must do it quietly.
But i will do it all the same.
And i trust you'd help me.
Yes, your majesty.
What's your name, man.
Charlie, sir.
Charlie roll.
Trade?
Shepherd.
Mr. Secretary cromwell.
Kneel.
Do you know well about it,
charlie?
Yes, captain aske.
We're not rebels,
We're pilgrimages
And we have a pilgrimage to go on.
If you want to join us then you shall
swear to be true to our mighty god.
To christ catholic church.
To our sovereign lord, the king.
And to the commons of this realm,
so help you god.
I do swear.
Wear this badge.
It show the five wounds of christ.
To prove that the commons
will fight in christ cause.
Yes, captain.
God bless you, charlie.
Sir.
Arise, sir thomas cromwell,
Also baron cromwell of wimbledon.
And from this day forth,
Lord privy seal.
Majesty.
Your grace. Your grace.
May i, son?
God be with you lad.
Your majesty is too kind.
Mary,
gifts like these are easy compared
with gifts of a heart.
It gives more pleasure than i can say
to see you reconcile with your father.
Mary.
Your majesty.
Here is enough
for a thousand crowns.
If you need anything
else you need only ask.
Thank you, your majesty.
Father.
Yes, father.
Mary's so sweet and affectional.
She's everything i heard should be.
It seems to be no wonder
she's so marvelous and beloved
for her virtue and goodness
in the hearts of the people.
Your majesty must invite her
to the court, show her off.
Your majesty,
Why were you not speak to me?
Because i'm disappointed.
Why?
I'm disappointed because
you're not yet with child.
Lord,
my lord, my lord.
We have come here in great haste
to tell you that
the great part of the north
as well as part of lincolnshire have risen
in sudden rebellion against his majesty.
There are master
of commons everywhere.
The beacons of rebellion burning
heir own light to cross the hills.
Just four days ago,
While we're collecting
taxes and hectinsome
We were set upon by an angry mob.
They captured one of the
commissioners call nicolas bello.
Pull him down from his hourse
and beat him to death
with their stave.
Among them, my lord,
we saw armed priests.
Urging on these rebellion's names
And cries 'kill them, kill them'.
Then we heard another man,
william lichie,
Who is known to be
your servant mr. Cromwell
have been hanged from a tree.
And what these rebels
said they want?
so far i can tell you,
they want to keep their holy days.
They want monasteries restored
and their church unelested, and...
no more taxed.
I heard they declared
they prospaid with their journey.
They intend to kill you,
my lord crownwell.
454 or 5 bishops,
and chancellor richie
as deviced taken church goods,
and tearing down churches.
Why dont the local gentry intervince
and serpress these traitors and wait.
Surely they want to protect
their lands than holy days.
They tried,
but the rebels then
come back even greater.
Some say, my lord crownwell,
they are not hundreds but thousands religion
rebelions against the king's church reforms
Why did you know,
you are suposed to know
everything that goes on here?
You told me there was little
opposition, on the contrary.
You told me that most people was
glad to see such places dissolved.
You were wrong.
You didn't know anything,
knave.
Sit down, write this.
We take it as greatest unkindness,
that our common unfearist objects
should rise agasint without any grounds.
As for taking the goods from
perish church which is never intended.
Yet even it had been intended.
True subjects would
have not dealt with me,
their princess in such violence.
But would petition me for that purpose.
Now,
i command you rebels to go home,
and say no more.
And remember your allegiance,
you are duly bound to to obey me,
your king.
Both by god's commoments,
and by the law of nature.
(LINCOLNSHIRE)
All commands, stick together
Now it's the time to arise,
for else ever
So forwards,
forwrds to york.
Forwards in pain of death.
Forwards in god's name,
forwards.
Writing to the gentry of yorkshire
Reminding them of their duties
to suppress these traitors,
penalties in not doing so...
so any case,
for suspending the work
of church commisioners,
- until rebels...
- no,
the only way to beat the king's
Authority into the hands
of rude people of north
Is to show them king's intend
to continue with reformation
And correction religion
whatever they say.
What ever they do
Yes
My lord
The rebels have taken lincoln
The rebels flag flies
over city gate
and more of them are
now marching on york.
My god, help us
when i was 5,
my mother and i were taken
accross london, into the tower.
There was a rebelion
against my father.
The cornish rebels
reached the city walls,
And inside everything was
panic, fear.
With no news at all,
nor army of my father.
My mother tried to remain calm,
she was terrified.
So was i,
I was sure we were
both going to be killed.
I'm appointing you command
of the royal forces,
You will arrive north
as soon as possible,
You will find guns and ordnances
of hunger, but don't tarry there
No, your majesty,
i will do all your majesty
commands and more
These rebels are
our traitors, charles.
Full of wretched
and devilish intense.
They must be punished,
For their detestable and unmature sin
of rebellion against their sirvior
Just as my father,
punish the cornishmen.
Charles, what is going on?
- Leave us.
- Yes your grace.
His majesty has charged me
would lead his army
against north rebels.
You are not to worry,
i will have my back enough men
and arms to subdue them.
Easily, i have his majesty's promise.
I hope to god, he keeps it.
I'm happy to accept this charge
Crownwell is being
blamed for everything,
And the rebels is demanding
his head with god's help.
I may will be able to deliver it.
The lord privy seal
I'll despatch duke of
surffolk to the royal army.
If we need to send the second
army to destroy the rebels.
Yes, your mejesty.
Unless they disperse
and said 100 of their ringleaders
to the duke of surffolk
of with halters around their necks.
Then he has our permission to burn
to destroy all their goods.
And make a fearful example
of them to all of our subjects.
Yes, majesty.
If still they do not submit,
mr. Cromwell,
then i promise the utter
destruction of them.
Their wives and their children.
Do you understand me?
i will destroy them all.
And then i'll destroy you, cromwell.

THE TUDORS
Saison 3 - Épisode 2
Traduction : dmbmh
Relecture : poloneill
Resynchro : kasius
Sir Thomas.
- Quelles sont les nouvelles ?
- Cette affaire agit comme la peste,
reculant un jour,
et avançant un autre.
Avec la promesse du pardon
et la menace de l'avancée
de l'armée royale,
les rebelles du Lincolnshire
sont rentrés chez eux.
Et dans le Yorkshire ?
Dans le Yorkshire et tout le nord,
nous faisons face ŕ la plus grande
insurrection jamais vue.
Les rebelles sont entrés
dans la ville de York, il y a 3 jours.
Ils ont célébré la messe,
et entendent se diriger vers le sud.
"Votre Majesté, je vous écris
au sujet d'une urgente affaire.
"Nous avons été informés
sur l'avancée de l'armée des pčlerins
"vers le château de Pontefract
qui est sous mon commandement.
"Je suis contraint de vous dire
"que je ne peux le défendre
sans renforts de soldats et d'armes.
"En tant que gardien
de ces frontičres,
"et un membre loyal
du Conseil de Votre Majesté,
"j'implore Votre Majesté d'envisager
de négocier avec ces pčlerins.
"Je demeure votre humble
et dévoué serviteur.
"Darcy."
- Qu'avez-vous trouvé ?
- Un éclat d'os, Majesté.
Avant qu'elle ne devienne un ulcčre,
vous me disiez qu'elle était guérie.
- Une telle plaie, Votre Majesté...
- Doux Jésus !
Vous ignorez ce que c'est,
n'est-ce pas ?
Ne vous inquiétez pas,
nous appliquerons un cataplasme
pour attirer plus d'éclats
vers la surface.
Nous trouverons par la suite
d'autres remčdes
qui guériront définitivement
la plaie de Votre Majesté.
Vous me prenez pour un idiot.
Tous ici me prennent pour un idiot.
Sortez.
Sortez !
Imposteurs ! Charlatans !
Je trouverai mon propre remčde.
- Votre Grâce.
- Milord,
promesse m'a été faite
d'avoir des armes ŕ mon arrivée,
mais je n'en vois aucune.
Nous avons des armes,
mais nous n'avons trouvé
aucun cheval ou chariot
pour les transporter.
Peut-ętre n'avez-vous pas compris.
Je suis ici, mandaté par le Roi.
Si vous ne pouvez réquisitionner
de chevaux pour Sa Majesté,
vous ne méritez pas d'ętre
le Maire de Londres.
Je ne voulais produire de panique
en contraignant les gens
ŕ mobiliser leurs chevaux
et leurs chariots.
Idiot !
Vous avez deux jours
pour trouver des chevaux
afin d'acheminer ces armes
ŕ notre armée,
sinon je vous tiendrai
pour responsable.
Avec un peu de chance, M. le Maire,
j'aurais la chance de voir
vos entrailles exposées ŕ Tyburn !
- Lady Rochford ?
- Madame.
Le Roi est confiné dans sa chambre
sur ordre de ses médecins,
mais vous envoie ses excuses
et espčre que vous allez bien.
Je m'inquičte tant pour lui,
surtout en pareils moments.
Votre Majesté a toutes les raisons
de l'ętre.
Ces rebelles ne sont rien d'autre
que des bandits.
Ils se sont complčtement écartés
de la vraie religion.
Voulant nous ramener
aux jours sombres
de l'ignorance et des superstitions.
Et par la force !
Je prie pour qu'ils soient
rapidement maîtrisés.
Je veux que vous organisiez
quelque chose pour moi.
Je suis sűre que cela procurera
une grande joie au Roi.
CHÂTEAU DE PONTEFRACT
YORKSHIRE, NORD DE L'ANGLETERRE
Mon Dieu, Lord Darcy,
quelle vision d'horreur est-ce lŕ.
De maudits rebelles
contre Sa Majesté le Roi,
exhibant insolemment
leurs honteux étendards.
En effet, Votre Grâce.
Je n'aurais jamais pensé un jour
avoir pareille vision.
Qu'allez-vous faire ?
Leur tirer dessus ?
Vous savez parfaitement
que je n'ai pas d'armes.
Nous pouvons résister
en fermant les portes.
Aprčs tout, ce sont lŕ
les ordres du Roi.
Je pense avant tout
qu'il est préférable de leur parler.
En tant que compatriotes...
et chrétiens.
Je vais rencontrer leurs chefs,
en dehors des murs du château.
Gardes !
Lord Darcy.
- Nous venons en paix.
- M. Aske,
en tant que représentant du Roi,
j'ai mission de vous arręter,
et d'occasionner certains
dommages ŕ votre cause.
Ce Pčlerinage de Grâce
est motivé par le bien de tous.
Pour l'amour que nous portons ŕ Dieu,
et ŕ notre Sainte-Église.
Pour la sauvegarde
de notre souverain, le Roi,
et pour dénoncer les brigands
et les conseillers malveillants.
Nous voulons demander au Roi
d'interrompre
la destruction illégale
- de nos monastčres et abbayes.
- M. Aske,
vous prétendez ętre loyal au Roi,
mais tous vos actes défient
et désavouent l'autorité du Roi.
Au contraire, Archevęque,
aucun homme en Angleterre
n'est plus fidčle au Roi que moi,
et le temps m'aidera ŕ le prouver.
Nos différends ne sont pas avec lui,
mais avec ceux qui l'entourent.
Vous osez ŕ présent parler
d'une voix haute et puissante,
alors que ceux de votre espčce
ętes aussi responsables
de ne pas avoir prévenu le Roi
sur la propagation de l'hérésie
et des abus dans tout son royaume.
Car que sont Cromwell et Cranmer
sinon des hérétiques
et des exploiteurs manifestes
de la communauté ?
Je vous l'ai dit,
nous voulons de mal ŕ personne.
Nous demandons asile
et libre passage.
Tous nos pčlerins ont pręté serment
de ne point occire ou tuer
sans raison.
D'écarter la peur de la communauté,
et de marcher, guidé
par la Croix du Christ,
et par la foi qu'ils ont en eux.
Mais nous nous battrons...
et nous mourrons...
si vous cherchez ŕ nous arręter.
Je vous charge d'établir
la défense de la ville.
Nous devons lever
de nouvelles forces.
Que tous les seigneurs
mobilisent leurs troupes.
Prenez de la Tour toutes les armes
et les munitions qu'il vous faut.
Achetez-en si nécessaire
des commerçants de la ville.
C'est donc vrai,
nous sommes en danger.
- Idiot !
- M. Cromwell,
Sa Majesté va vous recevoir.
Je viens de recevoir une lettre
de Lord Darcy.
Il dit qu'il est en grand danger
et qu'il ne pourra résister.
Et pourtant, il continue
ŕ tenir le château...
d'une maničre ferme.
N'envisage-t-il pas d'en finir
avec ces traîtres ?
Votre Majesté,
on vient de m'informer
que les rebelles ont déjŕ investi
la ville de Pontefract...
en nombre considérable.
Pontefract est la porte d'accčs
vers le sud.
Elle a une grande importance
stratégique.
Vous allez écrire une lettre
ŕ Lord Darcy.
Vous lui direz que j'attends
de lui qu'il tienne ce château.
Ŕ n'importe quel prix !
Et qu'en est-il de l'armée royale ?
Que font-ils pour écraser
cette révolte ?
Oů est le Duc de Suffolk ?
Et ce bâtard de Shrewsberry,
je l'avais également mandaté.
Mon Dieu,
que font donc ces hommes ?
- Messieurs, gens de York, amis...
- Lord Darcy.
Darcy et York m'ont trahi ?
Nous verrons quelle en sera la fin.
Pourquoi Shrewsberry et Suffolk
n'ont-ils pas encore attaqué ?
Tout ce que j'entends
ce sont leurs plaintes
et leurs excuses !
Savez-vous ce que je crois ?
Je crois qu'ils ont peur
de leurs ombres.
J'ai l'intention de m'y rendre,
moi-męme.
Je conduirais l'armée.
Et j'apprendrais
ŕ ces bâtards de rebelles
comment nous conduisons
un massacre !
- J'espčre que vous n'en ferez rien.
- Pourquoi donc ?
- Suis-je trop faible ?
- La vie de Votre Majesté
est trop précieuse pour la risquer
contre de vulgaires rebelles.
Bien sűr, si vous y allez, vous serez
tel le lion au milieu des loups.
Sir Francis,
nul besoin de me flatter.
Envoyez un message clair ŕ Suffolk.
Demandez-lui pourquoi
il refuse de m'obéir
et s'il est un lâche.
Si les choses vont mal,
je sais qui en sera responsable.
Puis-je soulager votre douleur ?
Je suis persuadé que vous pouvez.
FERME DE NEWARK
QUARTIER GÉNÉRAL DE BRANDON
Votre Grâce,
le Comte de Shrewsbury est ici.
- Laissez-nous, messieurs.
- Ŕ vos ordres, Votre Grâce.
Nous faisons face
ŕ une grave situation.
Non seulement les rebelles sont
plus nombreux et plus forts,
mais je ne peux faire confiance
aux hommes que j'ai.
Nombreux pensent que la cause
des rebelles est pieuse.
Pourtant, le Roi nous incite
ŕ attaquer le plus vite possible.
Il ne le ferait pas s'il voyait
la situation que nous vivons.
Je n'ai presque pas de cavaliers,
et ceux que j'ai,
préfčrent les couleurs du nord.
Engageriez-vous une bataille
oů la défaite est certaine ?
- Vous avez un autre plan ?
- Parlementer avec eux.
- Parlementer ?
- Milord,
notre but est de les empęcher
de marcher vers le sud.
Quand ils parlent,
ils ne marchent pas.
Ŕ vous d'informer le Roi.
Les armées de Shrewsbury sont ici...
Suffolk est ici,
non loin de Newark.
Il semble que leur plan premier
soit de tenir la ligne ici,
le long de la rivičre Trent,
pour bloquer notre avancée
vers le sud.
Combien sont-ils ?
Shrewsbury doit avoir 6 000 hommes.
Suffolk, beaucoup moins.
Ils sont aussi ŕ court
de chevaux et de canons.
Et combien sommes-nous ?
D'aprčs mes estimations, plus de...
30 000 hommes.
Nous maintenons
de nombreux effectifs
ici ŕ Doncaster,
ŕ l'abbaye de Jervaux,
et assiégeons actuellement
le Comte de Cumberland ŕ Skipton.
Le nord de la rivičre étant fait,
nous avons pris le contrôle
de presque tout le pays.
Laissons-les venir ŕ nous.
Avec l'aide de Dieu, M. Aske,
nous triompherons.
Pauvre de Vous, Votre Majesté.
Appliquez cet onguent.
Je sens une odeur d'oseille et...
de graines de lin ?
Herbe des prés,
perles pilées et feuilles d'agrumes,
entre autres.
Je l'ai moi-męme composé, je n'ai
aucune confiance en mes médecins.
Ne bougez pas.
Vous ętes bien courageuse.
Plus courageuse que mes capitaines.
Et bien plus jolie.
Voilŕ, c'est fini.
J'espčre que Votre Majesté va mieux.
Votre Majesté veut-elle
que je reste ?
Nous avons eu tort de croire
que le Roi d'Angleterre
allait reconnaître ses erreurs
et la menace qui pčse sur son âme.
Au lieu de cela,
il encourage Cromwell
ŕ vandaliser et profaner
les maisons de Dieu,
et ŕ voler leurs trésors
pour sa jouissance
et son usage personnel.
Cependant, męme dans l'obscurité
naît une lumičre.
Je veux parler de ce merveilleux
soulčvement des croyants.
- Le Pčlerinage de Grâce.
- J'en ai eu vent, aussi.
Des pčlerins qui marchent
derričre la banničre du Christ.
Le Saint-Pčre vous demande
de rédiger un pamphlet en anglais,
dénonçant le Roi et ses conseillers
comme hérétiques.
Bien sűr.
- Je commence sur-le-champ.
- Attendez, attendez.
Sa Sainteté veut plus de vous
qu'une simple signature.
Avec mon soutien,
il a décidé de vous nommer
son représentant officiel.
Vous vous rendrez en France
et dans les Pays-Bas,
oů vous rencontrerez des représentants
du Roi et de l'Empereur.
Vous les convaincrez
de fournir argent,
armes et mercenaires,
afin de soutenir cette sainte croisade
en Angleterre.
Si c'est ce que Sa Sainteté veut,
alors bien sűr, je m'y soumettrai,
tel un fils obéissant ŕ son pčre.
Sa Sainteté a consenti...
ŕ vous nommer Cardinal.
Voici votre barrette.
Je ne peux accepter.
Pourquoi donc ?
Je n'en suis pas digne.
En d'autres termes,
vous préférez votre jugement
ŕ celui du Pape, Votre Saint-Pčre.
Et vous pensez que ceci
vous fera paraître humble.
Mais en fait,
c'est un péché d'orgueil,
Pčre Pole.
Sa Grâce informe Votre Majesté
qu'il n'a nul autre choix
que de parlementer.
Ainsi, il espčre amener un membre
de la noblesse ŕ la traîtrise.
Pour leur bien et dans leur intéręt,
ils désavoueront les communs,
si nous leur promettons le pardon,
comme dans le Lincolnshire.
Ils ne seront pas tous pardonnés.
Pas leurs chefs... Jamais les chefs.
Qu'a donc offert Suffolk ŕ ces gens
pour qu'ils rentrent chez eux ?
Sa Grâce n'est pas entrée
dans les détails, mais...
pour soulager vos craintes,
il a écrit de sa propre main :
"J'implore Votre Majesté de consentir
ŕ toutes les offres
"que je ferais ŕ ces rebelles,
"car assurément,
je ne tiendrai aucune d'elles."
Ętes-vous heureux, ŕ présent ?
Quelle lubie, quelle folie
vous a conduit
ŕ envisager une révolte
aussi éhontée...
contre le souverain
le plus noble et le plus juste ?
N'avez-vous pas honte ?
Comment avez-vous osé ?
Non content d'offenser
votre seigneur,
vous lui donnez l'occasion
de vous combattre,
alors qu'il vous aime plus que tout,
et vous a toujours considérés
comme ses meilleurs amis.
Nous ne voulons nullement
offenser Sa Majesté.
Mais nous avons une requęte
que nous voulons lui soumettre,
pour la restauration
de nombreuses choses
qui ont été réduites en poussičre
dans ce royaume.
Nous demandons
la restitution de nos abbayes
et de nos droits anciens.
Qu'un nouveau parlement
soit constitué
pour répondre sincčrement
aux doléances des gens.
Je ne peux rien décider ici.
Mais, je propose une tręve.
Durant laquelle,
deux de vos capitaines
pourront présenter vos requętes
ŕ Sa Majesté.
La tręve sera maintenue
jusqu'ŕ leur retour.
Lord Darcy, puis-je vous parler ?
Vous plus que quiconque
devez ętre reconnaissant au Roi,
pour la confiance qu'il a en vous,
et il aimerait pouvoir
encore compter sur vous.
Mais, je vous vois vous associer
ŕ des rebelles et des traîtres.
Pour ma part, je suis et resterai,
fidčle au Roi, notre souverain,
comme je l'ai été
pour son pčre avant lui.
Si vous ętes aussi fidčle
que vous le dites,
vous pouvez nous le prouver,
en remettant votre capitaine, M. Aske,
entre nos mains.
Je ne peux ni veux y consentir.
Car si un homme promet
d'ętre fidčle ŕ quelqu'un
puis le trompe, il méritera sűrement
d'ętre appelé un traître.
Sa Majesté, le Roi !
Je suis ravie de vous voir
aussi plein de vie.
J'ai de bons médecins.
Néanmoins, nous devrons rendre visite
ŕ la tombe de Sir Thomas Becket
pour le remercier.
J'ai prévu autre chose,
qui, j'espčre de tout coeur,
vous apportera grand plaisir.
Votre Majesté, Lady Mary Tudor !
Je demande votre bénédiction.
Ma fille.
Je vous présente Sa Majesté,
la Reine Jane.
Je me souviens
que certains d'entre vous
voulaient que j'en finisse
avec cette perle.
Je vous tiens.
Vous ętes en sécurité.
Réjouissez-vous, Mary,
car je vous promets
que rien ne vous arrivera.
Continuez !
- Ętes-vous heureuse ?
- Oui, Votre Majesté.
Sa Majesté vous a octroyé
des appartements ŕ Hampton Court,
et d'autres ŕ Greenwich Palace.
Je les ai vus tous les deux.
Ils sont splendides.
Je suis trčs reconnaissante
ŕ Sa Majesté...
et ŕ vous aussi.
Tous prétendent
que ma fille est innocente.
Qu'elle ne connaît nulle souillure
ou discours injurieux.
Le croyez-vous ?
Croyez-vous qu'une personne
puisse ętre aussi innocente ?
Allez le vérifier.
Je voulais m'excuser
pour mon comportement.
J'espčre que votre coeur
pourra me pardonner.
J'essayerai, Sir Francis.
Jésus a incité au pardon.
Aimez-vous les jeux ?
Un nouveau jeu ŕ la cour
pourrait vous plaire.
- Qu'est-ce donc ?
- On le nomme cunnilingus.
- C'est une vieille pratique.
- Comment y joue-t-on ?
Eh bien, vous...
Vous...
Je pense que vous riez de moi.
Vous ne pouvez me toucher.
Ŕ César... j'appartiens.
Votre Majesté, Sir Ralph Ellerker
et M. John Constable !
Messieurs, je vous demande ceci :
Quel Roi a gardé ses sujets si longtemps
dans l'opulence et la paix ?
Jugeant équitablement
aussi bien le riche que l'indigent,
et vous protégeant
de tous les ennemis extérieurs ?
J'ai lu votre requęte.
Votre premier prétexte
est de maintenir la foi.
Mais je vous le dis,
rien n'est aussi contraire
aux injonctions divines que la révolte.
Se dresser comme des enragés
contre votre Roi,
délaissant vos terres et vos récoltes,
ce ne sont point les agissements
de la brillante communauté
que vous prétendez ętre.
- Majesté, je me dois de...
- Silence !
Vous ętes en présence du Roi !
De fausses allégations ont été faites
sur nos desseins ŕ l'égard de l'Église.
Nous n'avons rien fait sans
que le clergé ŕ York et Canterbury
n'aient admis ętre en accord
avec la Loi de Dieu.
La Loi de Dieu !
Alors, comment de simples gens
osent-ils dire le contraire ?
Quelle arrogance
et quelle folie les a pris
de prétendre connaître la Loi divine
quand ils sont ignorants...
et encore moins instruits et devraient
plutôt connaître leurs devoirs ?
Vous avez vu ŕ Lincolnshire et ailleurs
notre propension ŕ la mansuétude.
Cette rébellion est dirigée
contre l'exigence divine.
Je déclare mon intention, guidée
par la clémence de Notre coeur princier,
de pardonner ŕ tous ceux
qui se sont rebellés,
ŕ condition
que vous déposiez vos armes.
Le Duc de Suffolk
vous accompagnera dans le Yorkshire
pour conclure la paix,
et confirmer votre reddition.
Bonne journée, messieurs.
Vous devez savoir
que notre armée de pčlerins
ne renoncera pas
simplement sur la promesse
d'un pardon.
- Notre pčlerinage n'est pas achevé.
- Je le sais
et je m'en suis entretenu
avec le Roi.
Il m'a accordé la permission
d'entamer les négociations,
en toute confiance.
Sur la base de notre requęte.
Votre Grâce a-t-il
un gage le prouvant ?
Vous ne me croyez pas ?
Ce n'est point pour moi,
mais pour notre chef, M. Aske.
Il est notre avocat.
Voici un engagement,
rédigé par Sa Majesté,
de négocier avec vous ouvertement,
et raisonnablement
comme des sujets bien-aimés.
Nous sommes reconnaissants
et redevables ŕ Sa Majesté.
Bonne nuit, messieurs.
Celle-ci est pour le messager
du Lincolnshire.
Assurez-vous qu'elle soit envoyée.
M. Constable,
je vous supplie de ne pas croire
M. Cromwell.
Je remercie Dieu et Votre Majesté
pour sa grande miséricorde.
Vous ętes le plus gentil des régents,
et je voudrais que le monde entier
le sache.
Le monde choisit
ce qu'il veut savoir.
Mais vous pouvez le changer.
Je vous implore
de restaurer les abbayes.
Imaginez ce que le monde pensera,
en sachant que vous écoutez
votre peuple et votre coeur.
Je vous l'ai déjŕ dit,
ne vous męlez pas de mes affaires.
Souvenez-vous de celle
qui vous a précédée.
Je vous aime plus qu'elle.
Et plus encore que Catherine.
Ne gâchez pas cela.
PAYS-BAS ESPAGNOLS
Cardinal Pole.
Je suis Diego Hurtado de Mendoza
et ces messieurs sont les conseillers
de Sa Majesté Impériale,
le Roi Charles Quint.
J'apporte cette lettre de représentation
et d'autorité du Pape Paul.
Asseyons-nous.
Nous sommes conscients
que vous ętes venu ici pour...
Pardonnez-moi,
nous restons un peu hésitants
sur la nature exacte
de votre mission.
Vous avez certainement été informé
sur le soulčvement
qui s'est étendu dans toute
l'Angleterre contre le Roi,
Cromwell, cet hérétique,
et toute sa secte.
Certainement, nous en avons eu vent
et bien sűr,
nous sommes intrigués.
Ce soulčvement populaire...
est la meilleure chance
que nous ayons eue
pour restaurer la vraie religion
en Angleterre.
Mais les gens pieux de mon pays
ont besoin d'assistance.
Chacun de nous, M. Mendoza,
ŕ sa maničre,
doit encourager la poursuite
et l'expansion de ce soulčvement.
Męme si cela implique
la destitution du Roi
et pas seulement
celle de ses conseillers ?
Nous pouvons envisager
cela sans aucune crainte,
car il y a une prétendante au trône
avec un droit légitime
et une foi véritable :
Lady Mary.
Hormis elle...
un autre catholique
a également droit au trône.
Un descendant des Plantagenęt
qui ont régné avant les Tudor,
et régneraient volontiers aprčs eux.
De qui voulez-vous parler,
Éminence ?
Je parle de moi,
M. Mendoza.
Ralph, John,
nous avons prié pour votre retour.
Dieu merci.
Le Roi dans sa bienveillance
nous a offert
son pardon général.
Il a envoyé le Duc de Suffolk
pour négocier un traité
sans condition préalable
et sur la base de notre requęte.
Est-ce vrai ?
Je crois en la bonne volonté
et la mansuétude du Roi.
En voici la preuve.
Nous nous rencontrerons ici.
Vous n'avez encore rien dit, John.
Est-ce car vous n'ętes pas
d'accord avec Sir Ralph ?
Non, je ne peux l'ętre.
Comment le serais-je
quand je sais que ce diable
Cromwell a une telle emprise sur le Roi
que je suspecte
ces promesses d'ętre
complčtement vaines.
- Devrons-nous refuser cette rencontre ?
- Il nous faut les démasquer.
Appelons ŕ un rassemblement général,
prenons le contrôle de tout le nord,
et ensuite seulement...
nous consentirons ŕ cette rencontre.
Quelle raison avez-vous
de ne pas les croire ?
Celle-ci.
Qu'est-ce donc ?
La copie d'une lettre de Cromwell
ŕ la noblesse du Yorkshire.
J'en lis un passage pour vous.
"Il y a un espoir
qu'ils se rendent pacifiquement.
"Mais si ces rebelles persistent
dans leur rassemblement illégal,
"et leur provocation,
la rébellion sera alors anéantie
"d'une maničre si intense
"qu'ils seront un exemple
pour tous nos sujets
"jusqu'ŕ la fin des temps."
"Jusqu'ŕ la fin des temps",
messieurs.
Mais ils ne peuvent pas
nous anéantir,
et c'est pourquoi
le Duc est obligé de négocier.
Ce signe évident de diablerie
ne vous impressionne donc pas !
Il nous faudra maintenir
notre vigilance,
et nous préparer ŕ cette rencontre.
Clarifions nos positions
et consolidons nos arguments.
Que nos hommes de foi
les approuvent.
Qu'avons-nous ŕ craindre, John,
quand nous défendons
la parole de Dieu ?
Je le sais bien, mais...
J'espčre seulement qu'aucun de nous
ou de nos petits-enfants
ne regrettera ce moment.
Je voulais te souhaiter
le succčs dans ta mission,
et dans ta rencontre
avec les rebelles.
Je remercie Votre Majesté.
Tu sais que je veux
une solution pacifique.
Tu as permission de prolonger
la tręve autant que nécessaire.
Tu pourras offrir mon pardon
ŕ tous les rebelles.
Ŕ l'exception des chefs.
Je veux qu'ils se rendent...
avec des chaînes autour du cou.
Votre Majesté sait que les rebelles,
injustement, sans aucun doute,
accusent M. Cromwell
pour nombre de leurs maux.
Ils ont fréquemment demandé
son départ et sa sanction.
Que dois-je leur dire ?
Sais-tu ce que c'est ?
Des fruits du Nouveau-Monde.
De nouvelles choses arrivent
... tout change.
J'ai un féroce appétit
pour la nouveauté.
Dis-leur ce que tu veux.
J'ai lu votre nouvelle requęte.
Parmi d'autres articles,
vous demandez l'établissement
d'une session spéciale du Parlement,
pour débattre sans crainte
et sans courroucer Sa Majesté,
les questions d'hérésie,
de suprématie royale
et du maintien de la religion.
Je peux vous dire que le Roi
a consenti ŕ votre requęte.
Un parlement spécial sera instauré.
Il sera établi...
non pas ŕ Westminster, mais ici
ŕ York, pour débattre et statuer
sur toutes ces questions.
Merci. Nous avons aussi demandé
que les hérésies de Luther,
Wycliffe et Tyndale
soient annulées et détruites.
Nous demandons que les évęques
hérétiques et les laďques
soient punis.
Que Cromwell, Audley et
Sir Richard Rich
soient punis comme les destructeurs
des bonnes lois de ce royaume,
et les tenants des fausses sectes.
Ce n'est pas ŕ moi de le décider,
quels que soient mes sentiments,
mais ces points sont ceux
que devra traiter ce parlement.
Est-il possible que ce parlement
puisse débattre
de l'obéissance au Pape,
de la préservation des âmes,
et de la légitimité de Lady Mary ?
Oui, M. Aske. Je peux garantir
que toutes ces affaires
pourront ętre soulevées au parlement
sans aucune crainte ou faveur.
Le Roi est-il encore pręt
ŕ offrir un pardon général ?
Oui, et je le dis sans hésitation.
Plus Sa Majesté comprend
les raisons de ce soulčvement,
et la loyauté des pčlerins
ŕ sa personne et ŕ son rčgne,
plus il insiste pour montrer
de la clémence.
Il y a autre chose.
Vous savez que nous demandons
que la suppression
des abbayes cesse
et que celles-ci soient restaurées.
C'est notre point essentiel.
Nous sommes encore déterminés
ŕ nous battre et mourir
pour le maintien
de nos lieux de cultes.
Ŕ ce sujet, je peux dire
que la destruction des abbayes
cessera jusqu'ŕ la réunion
du parlement.
Il sera alors des prérogatives
du parlement de décider quand
les autres seront restaurées.
Rentrez chez vous...
et déposez les armes.
En nous unissant,
et en résistant...
nous avons obtenu beaucoup plus
que nous eussions espéré...
quand nous avons décidé
d'exécuter notre pčlerinage.
Ce sera bientôt Noël.
Rentrez chez vous
et célébrez la naissance
de Notre Seigneur, Jésus Christ.
Nous remercions Dieu...
autant que Sa Majesté, le Roi...
que tout cela ait été obtenu
sans effusion de sang.
Je vous prie d'écouter
le messager du Roi.
"Sa Gracieuse Majesté,
le Roi Henry VIII,
"par ce présent édit pardonne...
"ŕ tous les sujets
qui ont contrevenu
"et se sont soulevés
en une rébellion illégale."
Ŕ présent, je vous demande tous
de vous disperser,
regagnez vos foyers
et mettez vos armes de côté.
En sachant fermement
que notre religion...
sera maintenue et non pas détruite !
- Qu'y a-t-il, époux ?
- Une lettre du Roi.
Que dit-il ?
"Mon fidčle et bien-aimé Aske.
"J'ai été informé
que malgré les offenses
"commises contre Nous,
et votre tentative de rébellion,
"vous vous ętes ŕ présent repenti.
"Et puisque vous ętes déterminé
ŕ ętre un loyal sujet,
"Nous avons éprouvé le désir
de vous parler..."
- Pčre !
- Silence et écoutez votre pčre.
"... afin de connaître les circonstances
"précédant ŕ cette affaire."
Le Roi veut me parler.
Vous vous rendez compte ?
"De ce fait, je vous ordonne
en tant que loyal sujet,
"ainsi que nous le savons,
de venir ŕ la cour pour Noël.
"Nul ne doit le savoir, mais
vous pourrez faire preuve de sincérité
"et de franchise dans tout
ce que nous vous demanderons,
"ce pour quoi nous pourrons
vous récompenser en supplément.
Il y est joint une mention disant :
"Vous serez reçu ŕ la cour
en toute sécurité
"et vous repartirez
avant le 12e jour de Noël."
Assurez-vous simplement
qu'il entend honorer les promesses,
que Lord Suffolk a faites.
N'est-ce pas évident que le Roi
prend cette affaire ŕ coeur ?
Il a lui-męme rédigé cette lettre.
Vous ętes trop confiant.
Ŕ votre place, je refuserais.
Promesse a été faite sur mon retour.
Elles peuvent toutes ętre brisées.
M. Constable, les promesses d'un roi
ont nettement plus de valeurs
que celles de gens ordinaires.
Voici ce que nous ferons :
Je posterai des cavaliers
tout le long de la route
qui mčne ŕ Londres.
De telle sorte que si,
Dieu nous en préserve,
vous étiez emprisonné
ou maltraité,
je le saurai immédiatement
et réunirai les gens ŕ nouveau
pour vous délivrer.
Merci, Lord Darcy.

The Tudors 302
Synchro : Flolo Transcript : yyets.net
Sir Thomas.
- What's the news?
- This matter hangs like a fever
one day good, another bad.
With the promise of a pardon,
and the threat of an advancing
royal army, the rebels in
Lincolnshire have dispersed
- and gone home.
- And in Yorkshire?
In Yorkshire and the
whole North we are facing
the most dangerous insurrection
that has ever been seen.
The rebels entered the
town of York three days ago
and celebrated mass in the
cathedral; some say they intend
to march South.
- "Your Majesty, I write
to you on an urgent matter.
"We've had word that a
pilgrim army is marching
"on to Pontefract Castle,
which is under my command.
"I am compelled to tell you
that I can't defend this castle
"without more soldiers and arms.
"As the warden of the East
Marches and a loyal member
"of Your Majesty's council
"I beg Your Majesty to consider
negotiating with these pilgrims.
I remain your humble and
obedient servant. Darcy."
What is it? What have you found?
A splinter of bone, Your Majesty.
You told me before it was an
ulcer. That it was easily cured!
A wound like this, Your Majesty...
Jesus Christ! You don't know
what it is, do you? Do you?
Your Majesty must not be
alarmed. We shall apply
a poultice to draw any more
splinters to the surface.
Then we shall look to other remedies
to heal permanently
Your Majesty's wound.
You treat me like a fool.
Everyone here treats me like a fool.
Get out.
Get out!
- Majesty...
You're quacks and charlatans.
I will find my own remedies.
- Your Grace.
- My Lord,
I was promised artillery
when I arrived here.
But I don't see any guns.
Your Grace, we have guns but
we have not been unable to find
any horses or drays to transport them.
Perhaps you don't understand.
I am about the King's
most urgent business.
And if you cannot commandeer
some horses for his Majesty's
use then how can you call
yourself Mayor of London?
Your Grace, I did not want to
produce panic by forcing people
to part with their horses or drays.
IDIOT!
I charge you
personally to find enough
horses within two days and bring
the guns on after our army
- or God help me I will hold you
to account. With any luck, Mr.
Mayor, I will afterwards get
the chance to see you
disemboweled at Tyburn!
- Lady Rochford?
- Madam,
the King is still confined to his
chambers by his physicians' orders,
but sends his regrets
and hopes you are well.
I worry for him so much.
Especially at such a time.
Your Majesty is right to do so.
These rebels are nothing but villains;
they are totally alienated
from true religion.
They want to take us
back to the dark days
of ignorance and
superstition. And by force!
I hope to God they
will soon be overcome.
- Yes. Lady Rochford,
I have something I wish
you to arrange for me.
I'm sure it will give the
King a great deal of pleasure.
My God, Lord Darcy.
What a sight is there!
Arrant rebels against the King's Majesty
brazenly bearing their badges of shame!
Indeed so, Your Grace.
I never thought in all my
long days to see such a sight.
What are you going to do? Fire on them?
You know very well I have
almost no useful guns.
You could resist them all the
same, and close your gates.
After all those are the King's orders.
As to that, I think it
better to talk to them first,
as fellow Englishmen
and fellow Christians.
I'll meet their leaders
outside the castle walls.
Guards!
- My Lord Darcy, Your Grace, we come here in peace.
- Mr. Aske.
As the King's representative
I have the means here
to hinder you and to do
some injury to your cause.
My Lord, we have embarked
upon this Pilgrimage of Grace
for the common good, for the
love we bear to God's faith,
our Holy Church and
the maintenance of it,
for the preservation
of our sovereign King
and the expulsion of villain's
blood and evil councilors.
We mean to petition the King's highness
to stop the woeful destruction
of our monasteries and abbeys.
Master Aske, you claim
to be loyal to the King
but your very actions defy
and deny the King's supremacy!
Lord Archbishop, there is
no man now alive in England
more loyal to the King than I
am. I trust in time to prove it.
Our quarrel lies not with him, but only
with those close to him.
- It's very well for you
to sound so high and
mighty, but you and your kind
are also to blame for not
advising the King honestly
about the spread of heresy and
abuse throughout his kingdom.
For what are Cromwell
and Cranmer but heretics
and manifest abusers
of this commonwealth?
Lord Darcy, as I told you
we mean no displeasure to any person.
We ask for shelter and free passage.
All our pilgrims have taken an oath
not to slay or murder out
of envy, but to put away fear
for the commonwealth and
march with the cross of Christ
and their heart's faith before them.
But we will fight and die
if you seek to stop us.
I am putting you in charge
of the defenses here the city.
We shall need to organize new
levies. Send word to every lords
and gentlemen to be ready with
his power. Take all the weapons,
harness and ordnance
you need from the Tower.
Buy more if you need to from
the merchants in the city.
Then it's true. We are in trouble.
Mr. Cromwell, His Majesty
will receive you now.
I've just received a
letter from Lord Darcy.
He says that he is in
great danger from the rebels
and cannot maintain his resistance.
And yet he holds a
castle. A great stronghold.
Does he not mean to stand
firm against these traitors?
Your Majesty, I've just been told
that the rebels have already
entered the town of Pontefract
with overwhelming numbers.
Mr. Cromwell...
Pontefract is the gateway to the South.
It has great strategic importance.
You will write a letter
to Lord Darcy at once.
You will tell him that I expect him
to hold that castle at all costs!
Yes, Your Majesty.
And what of the royal army?
What are they doing to
crush this rebellion?
Where is his Grace the Duke of Suffolk?
And that bastard
Shrewsbury! I told him too!
What in God's name are these men doing?
Lord Darcy.
My Lord!
Darcy and York have betrayed me?
Well, we shall see
what end they come to!
And why haven't Shrewsbury
and Suffolk attacked yet?
All I hear are their
complaints and their excuses!
You know what I think?
I think they have become
afraid of their own shadows!
I have a mind to go North myself.
I'll lead the army! I'll
teach these bastard ingrates
and rebels a fearful
bloody lesson in slaughter!
I wish Your Majesty would
not consider doing so.
Why? Do you suppose I'm too feeble?
I meant that Your Majesty's
life is far too precious
to be put at risk against
such a common rabble.
Of course if you chose to go, you
would be like a lion among wolves.
Sir Francis, I don't
require you to flatter me.
No, Your Majesty.
Send a plain message to Suffolk.
Ask him why he refuses
to obey my commands
and ask him if he is a coward.
- Majesty.
- And Mr. Cromwell!
If things go badly, I know
well enough who to blame.
Can I get Your Majesty
anything for your pain?
Yes, I believe you can.
- Your Grace, the Earl
of Shrewsbury is here.
- My Lord.
- Your Grace.
Men dismissed.
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.
We meet at a desperate moment, my Lord.
Not only are the rebel forces
overwhelmingly strong against us,
but those men I do have I cannot
altogether trust. Many of them
I swear think the rebels'
quarrels to be good and godly.
Still, the King has urged us
to attack as soon as possible.
His Majesty would not do
so if he saw our plight
with his own eyes. I
have almost no horsemen,
and those I do have are
rather the flower of the North.
It is not possible your lordship
to give battle knowing
defeat to be a certainty.
- Do you have some other plan?
- I intend to parley with them.
- Parley?
- My Lord,
it's our first duty to stop
them escaping and marching South.
If they are talking
they are not marching.
Then you must tell the King.
Shrewsbury's forces are here...
Suffolk's here, not far from Newark.
It seems likely that they
had originally planned
to hold a line here,
along the River Trent,
to block our advance southwards.
How strong are they?
- We think that Shrewsbury's men
are 6000; Suffolk's a lot less.
They also lack horse and cannon.
- And how many are we?
- By my reckoning,
- somewhere over thirty thousand.
- Thirty Thousand?
We have kept large forces here
at Doncaster, at Jervaux Abbey
and we are presently laying siege
to the Earl of Cumberland's
castle at Skipton.
North of the River Don
we have almost complete
control of the country.
Let them come on to us!
With God on our side, Mr.
Aske, we shall prevail.
Poor you, Your Majesty.
Pour the ointment over it.
I smell sorrel and... linseed?
Meadowplant, crushed pearls,
herb of grace, other things.
I concocted it myself. I
don't trust my physicians.
Hold still!
You're very brave, Lady Misseldon.
Braver, I think, than my Captains.
And much more beautiful.
There, it's done. I trust Your
Majesty is more comfortable.
Does Your Majesty wish me to stay?
It seems we were wrong to
suppose that the King of England
would realize his mistakes
and the dangers to his soul.
Instead he continues
to encourage Cromwel
to vandalize and defile
the houses of God and steal
their treasures, all for
his own use and pleasure.
And yet, even in the
darkness there is a light.
I mean, this great
uprising of the faithful.
This Pilgrimage of Grace.
- I have heard of it too.
The pilgrims who marched
beneath the banner of Christ.
The Holy Father asks you to
write a pamphlet in English
denouncing the King and
his advisors as heretics.
Of course. I will start
work on it straight away.
No, No. Wait, wait.
His Holiness needs more from
you than just your signature.
With my encouragement, he
has decided to appoint you
an official legate.
You will travel to France and
to the Low Countries and meet
representatives of the
King and the Emperor.
- Eminence...?
- You will persuade them
to provide monies, arms and mercenaries
to support this most
Holy Crusade in England.
If that is what His Holiness
asks me to do, then of course
I will do it, like an
obedient son to a father.
His Holiness has agreed
to make you a Cardinal.
And here is your biretta.
- I cannot accept.
- Why not?
- I'm not worthy.
In other words, you
prefer your own judgment
to that of the Pope, your Holy Father.
No doubt you suppose that
makes you seem humble.
But actually it is the
sin of pride for the Pope.
His Grace informs Your Majesty
he has no choice in the matter
but to treat with them...
- In so doing, he hopes to bring
the nobles and the gentry to treachery
and for their own sakes
and their own interests
they will disown the
commons, if promised a pardon
as in fact happened in Lincolnshire.
They are not all to be pardoned.
Not the leaders. Never the leaders.
But what terms does
my Lord Suffolk intend
to offer the commons
to make them go home?
Huh... His Grace does not
go into details, but...
to allay Your Majesty's fears,
he writes, in his own hand:
"I beseech Your Majesty to take
in good part whatever promises
"I shall make to these rebels,
for surely I shall
never keep any of them."
Alas, you unhappy men.
What fancy, what folly
has led and seduced you
to make this most shameful
rebellion against our most noble
and righteous king and sovereign?
Are you not ashamed?
How can you do this,
not only giving offence to
your natural sovereign Lord
but giving us occasion
to fight with you,
that have loved you more than
any other part of the realm,
and have always taken
you for our best friends?
Your Grace, we mean no
offence to His Majesty.
But we have a petition which we
desire humbly to submit to him,
for the restoration of many things
which have gone amiss in this realm.
We demand the restoration of our abbeys
and our ancient rights.
- And a new Parliament
be summoned to address the
people's sincere grievances.
I can decide nothing here.
But I propose a truce, during
which time two of your captains
can take your petition and
present it to His Majesty.
The truce to be maintained
until they return.
My Lord Darcy, can we talk a moment?
My Lord Darcy, you more
than anyone here has cause
to be grateful to the
King for his bounty,
for the trust he reposes in you
and would like to repose in you still.
And yet here I find you
consorting with rebels and traitors.
For my part I have been and
always will be true to the King
our sovereign Lord, as I
was to his father before him.
If you are as true and loyal as you say,
then you can prove it
to us by giving over
your Captain Mr. Aske into our hands.
Sir, that I cannot and will
not do. For a man who promises
to be true to someone then
betrays him may truly be called
a traitor.
His Majesty, the King!
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
Madam.
Your Majesty.
It makes me happy to
see you so much improved.
I have a good physician.
Nevertheless, I intend
we shall visit the shrine
of Sir Thomas Becket
and give our thanks.
I have arranged for
something else which I hope,
with all my heart, will
make you very happy.
Your Majesty, the Lady Mary Tudor.
I ask Your Majesty for His blessing.
My own daughter.
May I present you to
Her Majesty Queen Jane?
I remember, some of you were desirous
that I should put this jewel to death!
I've got you, your safe.
Be of good cheer, Mary.
For I swear nothing
now will go against you.
Continue!
- Are you happy?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
His Majesty has agreed to give
you lodgings at Hampton Court
and others at Greenwich Palace.
I've seen them both; they're beautiful.
I am very grateful to
His Majesty and to you.
Everyone says my daughter is
innocent, that she doesn't know
any unclean or foul speech.
Do you believe that? Do you believe
that anybody could be that innocent?
Go and find out.
Lady Mary.
I wanted to apologize for my behavior.
I hope you can find it in
your heart to forgive me.
I will try, Sir Francis.
Jesus asks us to forgive everyone.
- Do you like games, Lady Mary?
- Yes.
There is a new game at
court that you might enjoy.
What is it?
It's called cunnilingus.
It's an old country practice.
How do you play it?
Well you...
You...
I think you're making
fun of me, Sir Francis.
No! No le me tangere...
you can't touch me.
For Caesar's I am.
Your Majesty, Sir Ralph
Ellerker and Mr. John Constable.
Gentlemen, I ask you this:
what King has kept his subjects
so long in wealth and peace?
So ministered justice
equally to high and low,
and protected you from
all outward enemies?
I have read your submission.
Your first pretence is that
you seek to maintain the faith.
But I tell you now gentlemen,
that nothing is more
contrary to God's commandment
than rebellion. Rising like
madmen against your prince,
leaving lands untilled and
corn unsown is not the behavior
of the proper commonwealth you claim to be!
- Your Majesty I feel compelled.
Hush! You are before the King's Majesty.
You make false claims about our
intentions towards the church.
We have done nothing but
what the clergy in York
and Canterbury agreed was in
accordance with God's holy word.
God's holy word, gentlemen!
So how can the simple
people say the contrary?
What presumption and madness
is it of them to claim
the knowledge of God's
law when they are ignorant
and less knowledgeable and
should rather know their duty?
You have seen before, in
Lincolnshire and elsewhere,
how temperate and forgiving
is our inclination.
Though rebellion is against God's will,
I declare my intention through the pity
and compassion of our
princely heart to pardon
all of you who have transgressed,
on condition that you
now lay down your arms.
His Grace the Duke of Suffolk
will come North again to Yorkshire
to moderate with you and make peace
and see you disbanded.
Good day, gentlemen.
Your Grace?
Your Grace should know
our army of pilgrims
will not disperse just for
the promise of a pardon.
Our pilgrimage is not over.
- I do know.
And I have told the King.
That is why he has given me
permission to negotiate with
you further in good faith.
- On the basis of our petition?
- Yes.
Does Your Grace have some
token of this "good faith"?
You don't trust my word?
Not for me, for our Captain
Mr. Aske. He's a lawyer.
Here is a promise.
in his Majesty's own hand,
to deal with you openly,
fairly and reasonably,
as his loving subjects.
We are grateful and
bounden to His Majesty.
Good night, gentlemen.
This is for the Lancashire Herald.
See that it is dispatched immediately.
Mr. Constable... I beg
you, do not put your trust
in Mr. Cromwell.
I thank God and Your Majesty
for your great mercy today.
I think you are the kindest of rulers,
and I wish with all my
heart the world knew it.
The world chooses what
it wants to know, Jane.
But you can change its mind!
I beg you to restore
- and keep the abbeys.
- Jane...
Think what the world will think.
That you listened to your
people and to your heart.
- Jane...
- I've told you once before:
don't to meddle with my affairs.
Do you remember what
happened to the late Queen?
Yes...
- I love you more than her.
More even than Catherine.
Don't spoil it.
Cardinal Pole.
My name is Diego Hurtado de Mendoza
and these gentlemen are all advisers
to His Imperial Majesty, King Charles V.
Sirs, I carry this letter
of legatine authority from
his Holiness Pope Paul.
Shall we be seated?
We were aware, Eminence, that
you were on your way here.
But, forgive me, we remain
a little unsure as to the
exact nature of your mission.
I am sure you are aware
of the risings which have
taken place across England
against the King, that heretic
Cromwell and all his sect.
We have heard
some information, certainly.
And naturally we are intrigued.
These popular risings
are the greatest chance
that we may ever have to restore
the true religion to England,
but the faithful people
of my country need support.
Each of us, senor Mendoza,
in our own way must encourage
the risings to continue
and to grow in strength.
Even if that means the
overthrow of the King himself,
not just his wicked council?
Yes.
We can imagine such
an outcome without fear
for there is another,
close to the throne,
with a legitimate
claim and a true faith:
the Lady Mary.
If not her,
there is still another Catholic
with a legitimate claim.
A scion of the Plantagenets,
who ruled before the Tudors,
and would gladly rule after them.
Of whom do you speak, Your Eminence?
I speak of myself, senor Mendoza.
Ralph...
John! We have waited and
prayed for your safe return.
Thank God! Thank God!
- The King in his mercy
has offered us a general
pardon! He is also sending
the Duke of Suffolk to
negotiate and treat with us,
without preconditions and
on the basis of our demands.
- Is it true?
- I trust the King's good faith
and mercy and here's the proof of it.
We are to meet again here.
You have not said anything yet, John.
Is it because you do
not agree with Sir Ralph?
No, I cannot agree with him.
How should I agree when I think
that devil Cromwell has
such a hold over the King
that I account these promises
to be utterly worthless!
You don't think we
should meet with them?
No, I don't. We should
expose their lies.
Call a general muster,
take over all of the North
and only then condescend to a meeting.
Why are you so sure that their
word is not to be trusted?
- Because of this.
- What's that?
A copy of a letter from Cromwell
to the Yorkshire gentry.
I'll read some of it to you.
"There is hope they
may disperse peacefully,
"but if these rebels continue
with their illegal assemblies
"and their defiance then
their rebellion will be crushed
"so forcibly that their example
shall be fearful to all subjects
so long as the world does endure."
"So long as the world
does endure", gentlemen.
But the truth is they cannot crush us.
And that is why the Duke
is forced to negotiate.
This sure sign of their deviousness
does not impress you then?
I say we do not stop our vigilance.
But prepare for our meeting,
clarify our positions
and strengthen our arguments and have
our Church leaders endorse them.
Why should we fear, John,
when we are about God's work?
I know we are but...
I only hope that none of
us - nor our grandchildren -
ever live to regret this moment.
I wanted to wish you every
success for your journey
and conference with the rebels.
- I am grateful to Your Majesty.
You know I desire more than
anything else a peaceful remedy.
You have my permission to
prolong the truce for as long
as necessary. You may also
affirm my general pardon
to all the rebels. Except their leaders.
I want them brought to you still,
with halters around their necks!
Your Majesty knows the rebels,
no doubt unjustly, blame
Master Cromwell for
many of their actions.
Repeatedly they ask for
his removal and punishment.
What should I tell them?
You know what this is, Charles?
Fruit from the New
World. New things come in.
Everything changes. I have
a great appetite for novelty.
Tell them what you like.
Gentlemen, I have
read your new petition.
Among other articles,
you ask for the setting up
of a special convocation or Parliament
to debate without fear
or his Majesty's displeasure
questions of heresy,
the royal supremacy, and
maintenance of the faith.
I can tell you now that the King has
graciously conceded to your request.
A special parliament
will be summoned to be held
not far away at Westminster
but here in York, to debate and
decide on all these questions.
Thank you. We have asked for the
heresies of Luther, Wycliffe and Tyndale
to be annulled and destroyed.
We have asked that the heretics,
bishops and temporal, be punished.
That Cromwell, Audley, Sir Richard Rich
be punished as subverters of
the good laws of this realm
and maintainers of false sects.
That is not for me to decide
whatever my true feelings.
But such questions are exactly
what the special Parliament
will be constituted to decide.
Is it possible that this
Parliament can also debate
the question of papal obedience,
touching the cure of souls,
and the legitimacy of the Lady Mary?
Yes, Mr. Aske.
I can guarantee that all
these great matters can be put
before the Parliament
without fear or favor.
And the King is still willing
to offer a general pardon?
Yes. I say that with hesitation.
The more His Majesty understands
the causes of this uprising,
and the loyalty of the
pilgrims to his person and rule,
the more is he persuaded
to show clemency.
- There is one other great
matter. Your Grace knows
that we demand that the suppressed
abbeys should stand or be restored.
This is our sticking point.
We were always determined
to fight and die
for the maintenance of
our religious houses.
What I can say about that is that
all further destruction
of the abbeys will cease
until Parliament meets.
It will then be up to
Parliament to decide if and when
the others will be restored.
Go home and put aside your arms.
By standing together
and by standing strong,
I believe we have achieved as
much as we could have gained
when we first took up this
great pilgrimage of ours.
It is almost Christmas. Go
home and celebrate the birth
of our Lord Jesus Christ
We thank God as we
thank the King's Majesty
that all this has been
achieved without bloodshed.
Please listen to the King's herald.
"His Gracious Majesty King Henry VIII
"hereby pardons by royal
command all those subjects
who have transgressed and
risen in unlawful rebellion."
I therefore ask everyone of you
to disperse, go home
and put aside your arms.
Firm in the knowledge that
our faith is to be maintained
and not destroyed!
- What is it, husband?
- I believe it's from the King.
What does it say?
Father?!
"My trusty and well-beloved
Aske. I am informed that,
"notwithstanding your
offences committed against us
"in the late rebellion
attempted in those parts,
"you are now at heart repentant.
"And since you are determined
to be a faithful subject,
we have conceived a great
desire to speak with you..."
- Father!
- Hush, children, hush! Listen to your father..
"... and to hear from your mouth the whole
circumstance and beginning of that matter."
The King wants to speak
with me. Can you believe it?
"I therefore order you, as
our true and faithful subject,
"as we now repute you, to come
to court for Christmastide.
"You are not to let anyone know,
but you will use such plainness
"and frankness in all things
we shall demand of you,
that we may have cause to
reward you even further."
There is a credence attached saying
that "You shall safe come
and safe go from court,
returning before the
twelfth day of Christmas."
Just make sure that he
means to honor the promises
Lord Suffolk made on
his behalf at Doncaster.
Is it not obvious that the
King has taken this matter
to his heart? This is a
letter written in his own hand.
- You are still too trusting.
- I would not go now.
But there is a promise of safe return.
- Promises can be broken.
- Mr. Constable, the promises
of a King are worth a great
deal more than the promises
- of ordinary folk.
- Here's what we shall do:
I will arrange to lay post
horses all the way between here
and London, so that if
God forbid, Mr. Aske,
you were imprisoned or
otherwise badly treated,
I will hear about it straight away,
and raise the people
again for your deliverance.
Thank you Lord, that's it.
Comment, au Nom de Dieu, bannir
adultère,
superstition et idolâtrie
de nos églises
quand ils sont pratiqués à la Cour ?
Quand rencontrerai-je Sa Majesté,
My Lord ?
Très bientôt.
Sa Majesté est impatiente de vous parler.
En attendant, il vous encourage
à détailler par écrit
toutes vos actions
durant la rébellion et leurs raisons.
Restez !
Qui êtes-vous ? Que faites-vous là ?
Vous ne pouvez pas y être.
Oh mon Dieu,
c'est vrai.
- Je n'y croyais pas.
- Sortez. Sortez.
C'est ma fiancée...
- Devrais-je ?
- Vous ne pouvez être là.
Vous étiez prévenu.
Il est vivant ?
Maître Holbein.
- Maître Holbein.
- Votre Majesté.
Je dois demander
pardon à Votre Majesté.
Pardon ?
Pour ?
J'ai commis une agression,
dans l'enceinte de votre Cour.
Agression ?
Vous ?
Mais vous êtes un artiste.
Je faisais le tableau de Lady Misseldon
que Votre Majesté a commandé,
quand un homme nous a interrompus.
- Qu'avez-vous fait ?
- Je...
J'ai jeté l'homme
contre des étagères.
Vous avez bien fait.
Et je vous pardonnerai volontiers.
J'aurais fait la même chose.
Terminez ce portrait,
je ne peux plus attendre.
- Merci, Votre Majesté.
- Maître Holbein.
Sir Robert Tavistock.
Sir Robert,
- vous semblez blessé.
- Votre Majesté
J'ai à me plaindre
de maître Holbein.
Je suis fiancé à une jeune fille,
et je l'ai trouvé à la peindre...
Nue.
- Nue ?
- Oui, Votre Majesté.
Sur un lit, comme une courtisane.
Je demande à Votre Majesté
de punir sévèrement M. Holbein
pour sa lubricité,
son immoralité,
et sa violence envers moi.
Vous n'avez pas à faire
avec M. Holbein
mais avec moi.
Je le dis franchement.
Avec sept paysans,
je peux faire sept lords.
Mais avec sept lords,
je ne peux pas faire un Holbein.
Alors, dites-moi sincèrement,
souhaitez-vous toujours punir
M. Holbein ?
Non, Votre Majesté.
Je demande pardon à Votre Majesté.
Je suis l'humble et obéissant serviteur
de Votre Majesté,
et ne me plains pas de M. Holbein.
Bon garçon.
Joyeux Noël, Robert.
- Majesté ?
- Ma chère.
- Puis-je vous présenter quelqu'un ?
- Très bien.
La comtesse de Salisbury
est mon ancienne gouvernante.
Je sais.
Je la connais très bien.
- Lady Margaret ?
- Votre Majesté.
Vous êtes la bienvenue à la Cour.
Je sais que vous quittez peu
votre maison.
C'est vrai.
Je préfère vivre une vie basée
sur la piété et les traditions,
Votre Majesté.
Vous êtes un exemple pour tous,
à la Cour.
Comment va votre fils,
Reginald Pole ?
- Étudie-t-il toujours en Italie ?
- Oui, Votre Majesté.
Il est maintenant
à l'université de Padoue,
et a plus de raisons que d'autres
d'être reconnaissant envers Votre Majesté,
puisque
très récemment,
vous avez payé ses frais de scolarité.
Je m'intéresse beaucoup à lui.
Il m'a apporté beaucoup d'espoirs
en tant qu'étudiant et cousin.
Mais quand vous avez refusé
mon offre d'en faire le plus jeune
évêque de Winchester,
je me souviens avoir dû le battre.
Votre Majesté, croyez qu'il ne s'agissait
pas d'ingratitude de sa part.
Il était en larmes
après vous avoir quitté.
La vérité est que... mon fils
est trop studieux
et réservé pour une charge publique
ou la notoriété.
Alors, après tout, je lui pardonne.
- Majesté.
- Lady Salisbury.
Vous conspirez, mesdames.
Nous aimerions présenter quelqu'un
à Votre Majesté pour Noël.
Très bien.
Votre Majesté, c'est...
Ma fille Elizabeth.
Inutile de le dire.
Approche.
Votre Majesté, M. Robert Aske.
Majesté.
M. Aske.
Venez.
Je suis très content de vous voir.
Pendant longtemps,
je pense avoir été mal informé
sur les causes des désordres
dans le Nord de notre royaume.
Mais j'ai lu votre explication
détaillée et franche.
Je suis convaincu
de la justice de votre cause.
Je considère
toujours le bien du Royaume
et l'amour de mes sujets,
M. Aske, plus que toute autre richesse.
Les paroles de Votre Majesté
m'emplissent d'humilité,
<i>et je demande humblement</i>
si Votre Majesté a l'intention
de tenir les promesses
faites en Votre nom,
par Sa Grâce
le Duc de Suffolk, à Pontefract.
En tout point.
Le pardon généreux et total
sera étendu à nos sujets du Nord.
Il y aura des élections libres
pour un Parlement à York,
où des membres du clergé,
sans nous déplaire,
pourront parler, montrer leur savoir
et leur liberté d'esprit.
De plus,
après que Lord Suffolk ait
officiellement
proclamé cela,
pour montrer l'amour
que je porte à mes sujets du Nord,
je viendrai à York en personne.
Et c'est là, M. Aske,
que ma Reine sera couronnée.
Votre Majesté est si bienveillante.
Je vous le jure. Vous ne trouverez pas
de peuple plus aimant et loyal
dans tout votre royaume
que celui du Yorkshire Nord.
Encore une chose,
vous avez écrit
contre certains de mes conseillers
et protesté contre
leur manque de noblesse.
Votre Majesté, je...
Je l'admets.
Mais n'en dites rien.
J'ai un cadeau pour vous.
Majesté, je...
Joyeux Noël, M. Aske.
C'est assez divertissant.
Vous ignorez
qui je suis, n'est-ce pas ?
Bien sûr que non.
Vous êtes la femme d'Edward Seymour.
Si jamais il nous trouve,
il vous tuera.
Vraiment ?
Il semble aimable.
Froid, peut-être, mais
agréable en société.
C'est une erreur courante.
<i>Ave Maria, gratia plena,
Dominus tecum, Amen</i>
M. Aske.
Lady Mary.
Désolée d'interrompre vos prières.
Pas du tout,
puisque vous en faites partie.
Je viens juste vous souhaiter
que tout aille bien.
Il se dit que vous êtes
en mission pour Dieu.
Je fais confiance
à Sa Majesté pour exaucer
- vos désirs et ceux de votre peuple.
- J'ai grand espoir
que vous deveniez un jour Reine,
comme je l'ai toujours souhaité,
pour la préservation de notre foi.
Lady,
vous devez savoir,
à quel point le peuple vous aime,
tout comme votre mère avant vous.
Que Dieu ait son âme.
Pensez à moi avec ceci.
Que Dieu vous bénisse
et vous protège, M. Aske.
Comment va père ?
On m'a dit qu'il est tombé malade.
J'attendais un meilleur moment.
Père est mort.
Mort ?
Quand ?
- Pourquoi ?
- Souris.
Il y a une semaine.
- Une semaine ?
- Oui.
J'ai organisé les funérailles,
son honneur est sauf.
Tu aurais dû me le dire.
J'aurais dû être là.
J'aurais aimé faire autrement,
mais je n'ai pas pu,
ta place est ici,
tu dois le comprendre.
Tu pourras aller à son mausolée.
- Soeur.
- My Lady.
Je suppose que tu l'as informée
pour son père. Elle va bien ?
Bien sûr. C'est la Reine.
Messieurs.
Nobles et hommes pieux de ce pays,
je jure sur la foi
que je porte à Dieu
et St. George que j'ai
pardonné et gracié les hommes
du Nord dans un écrit scellé
mais également au fond de moi.
<i>C'est un honneur que ces hommes
portent la croix de St George,</i>
eux qui ont accepté
ma grâce avec gratitude
et souhaitent être de loyaux sujets,
comme ils le furent
avant leur insurrection.
Ma Reine et moi
vous souhaitons une bonne
et prospère année.
<i>Je vous le dis franchement,</i>
<i>le Roi est un grand
et généreux Seigneur</i>
qui a exaucé autant qu'il l'a pu,
tous nos désirs et suppliques.
<i>C'est vrai. J'ai entendu
de sa bouche</i>
qu'il a l'intention d'organiser
un parlement juste et libre à York,
- et d'y couronner la Reine.
- Promesses M. Aske, que des promesses.
Non, pas que des promesses.
Lord Suffolk a juré de venir
pour apporter l'autorité
et le sceau du Roi
et il m'a répondu favorablement
jusqu'à présent.
Je dois vous dire, M. Aske,
bien qu'il me convienne de le faire,
que depuis votre départ,
il y a eu plusieurs rumeurs
<i>et une méfiance générale
face au Roi et à son conseil.</i>
Oui. Les contrées du Nord
rouvrent leurs monastères
et cette fois,
nous ne serons pas trahis.
Dites-leur de me croire, John.
<i>Dites-leur d'attendre
l'arrivée de Lord Suffolk.</i>
Un nouveau soulèvement
mettrait tout en péril.
Robert,
il fut un temps où rien n'était plus
fiable que la promesse d'un prince.
Maintenant...
nous pensons que ces promesses
ne sont rien d'autre qu'une politique
pour aveugler le peuple.
<i>Et quand nous nous soulèverons
à nouveau,</i>
nous ne croirons aucune promesse.
<i>Je n'y crois pas.</i>
Si vous ne faites pas confiance au Roi,
allez-vous au moins me faire confiance ?
Ne vous ai-je pas guidés jusqu'ici ?
N'ai-je pas obtenu
notre grâce à tous ?
Mais pouvez-vous nous garantir
que le Roi va rétablir
nos monastères ?
Sa Grâce m'a promis que toutes
ces questions seraient débattues
librement au parlement.
<i>Je le crois.</i>
Il m'a offert tout ce qu'un homme
peut espérer de son souverain.
Nous n'avons pas de preuves.
- Où allez-vous ?
- Marcher sur Carlisle.
John, je vous en prie,
pour l'amour de Dieu,
ne mettez pas cet accord en péril
par des actes déloyaux
et des jugements hâtifs.
Leur conviction est faite, M. Aske.
Avant même votre retour.
Il n'y a pas d'accord,
mais des promesses en l'air.
Le Roi n'agira pas par des mots
mais par des actions.
Nous allons accomplir
ce qui aurait déjà dû l'être.
Rassemble les hommes.
Je regrette que Lady Mary
ne soit pas à la Cour.
Elle me manque beaucoup.
Oui, et Lady Elizabeth.
N'est-ce pas la plus douce,
intelligente et brillante des enfants ?
Ce ne fut facile
pour aucune des deux.
Malgré mes ennuis,
je n'échangerais pas contre les leurs.
Votre Majesté.
Je ne sais pas si
je dois vous le dire
mais le Roi a pris Lady Misseldon
pour maîtresse.
Il doit suivre sa volonté.
C'est à nous, Lady Rochford,
d'obéir et d'honorer.
Ne vous inquiétez pas pour moi,
j'ai de bonnes raisons
d'être heureuse.
Le Duc de Suffolk,
et Lord Privy Seal.
- Vous irez au Nord.
- Oui, Votre Majesté.
Dans le but d'établir
l'obédience attendue,
vous allez faire prêter serment
aux meneurs et gentilshommes
du Yorkshire et du Lancashire.
Ils devront reconnaitre avoir prêté
un serment contraire
à la loyauté due à Dieu.
Ils doivent y renoncer avec vigueur
et jurer d'être nos véritables
et fidèles sujets.
Ils doivent s'engager à obéir
et même à répandre leur sang
pour soutenir nos lois
et aider nos fonctionnaires religieux
dans leurs tâches.
S'ils ne prêtent pas serment,
il n'y aura aucune clémence.
Vous arrêterez ces personnes
sans vous mettre en danger.
Et ils seront, selon la loi,
jugés puis exécutés.
Votre Majesté,
quelles sont vos instructions
sur la mise en place
du parlement à York ?
Vous pouvez annoncer
un délai supplémentaire.
Votre Majesté, j'ai...
J'ai mis mon honneur en jeu.
Je vous rappelle, Votre Grâce,
que la rébellion
est un ignoble péché
qui réclame un châtiment suprême.
C'est le pire des péchés.
Car où il n'y a pas d'ordre,
il n'y a que la liberté charnelle,
le péché
et la confusion babylonienne.
Ces hommes minables ont pris
tout mon royaume à l'abordage
comme s'ils m'avaient pris, Charles.
Il faut qu'ils soient
punis pour cela.
Je suis avec Votre Majesté.
- Si je peux me permettre...
- Non.
Vos origines, M. Cromwell,
vous rendent inapte à vous mêler
des affaires du Roi.
Vous êtes renvoyé.
- Charlie.
- Capitaine Constable.
La plupart des hommes débutent ensemble.
Vous êtes de bonne humeur.
Oui, heureux que vous soyez prêts.
Les autres nous rejoindront demain.
Nous entrerons dans Carlisle,
et attaquerons le château
le plus rapidement possible.
- Qu'avons-nous ici ?
- Des lapins.
Des lapins.
Et qu'allez-vous en faire ?
Nourrir les 5000 hommes ?
Jésus !
Charlie ! Restez baissé !
- Sortez, sortez !
- Allez !
Bien.
Donnez-lui de l'eau.
Mon Dieu.
Qu'est-il arrivé, au Nom de Dieu ?
On a commencé ensemble, M. Aske,
près de Carlisle,
prêts, et impatients
d'attaquer le château.
Ensuite, Sir Cristopher Dacre
et Lord Suffolk
sont sortis du château
avec des hommes
armés de lances.
Après, les hommes capturés
enchaînés, ébouillantés.
J'ai vu mes deux fils fauchés.
<i>Dieu, aide-nous.</i>
Messieurs, nous sommes brisés.
Qu'en est-il de M. Constable ?
Capturé.
My Lord.
Nous l'avons.
Ils ont violé leur serment.
- Je veux voir le Roi.
- Oui, My Lord.
Nous imposerons la loi martiale
sur le Nord tout entier.
John Constable ?
Oui.
Niez-vous avoir agi en tant que chef
des capitaines de cette rébellion ?
Non. J'en suis fier.
Vous serez emmené à Londres
et interrogé
sur vos agissements.
Vous voulez dire torturé.
Vous nous avez promis un parlement
mais vous avez menti.
Vous nous avez trahis.
Vous n'avez jamais eu l'intention
de faire quoi que ce soit,
n'est-ce pas, Votre Grâce ?
Voici les noms de ceux
qui refusent de se déclarer
et de signer le serment.
- Combien ?
- 74. Tous seront exécutés, Votre Grâce.
C'était parfait, Votre Grâce.
Vous savez que c'est l'ordre de
Sa Majesté d'arrêter Lord Darcy,
Sir Ralph Ellerker et Robert Aske.
Ils sont soupçonnés de trahison,
mais ne doivent pas le savoir.
Votre Grâce doit certainement savoir
que M. Aske, Sir Ralph et moi
étions fermement et ouvertement
opposés à ce nouveau soulèvement.
Nous croyions et croyons toujours
en les promesses et l'assurance
des bonnes grâces de sa Majesté le Roi.
Il est vrai aussi
que rien ne peut être fait
ou imaginé ici
contre Sa Majesté le Roi,
sans que j'en informe
le conseil ou vous-même.
Je suis persuadé de votre loyauté
envers sa Majesté.
Néanmoins, le Roi demande
que vous veniez avec moi
pour expliquer
ces récents évènements
qui semblent tellement contraires
à ses espoirs.
Votre Grâce peut voir
de ses propres yeux,
que je suis vieux, malade
et inapte à voyager.
Laissez-moi vous parler honnêtement,
Votre Grâce.
Bien que j'aime
et aie une confiance absolue
en le Roi,
et sache qu'il me traiterait
toujours avec raison
et miséricorde,
je ne peux dire la même chose
de certains de ses conseillers.
J'aurais plutôt peur de tomber
entre leurs mains, My Lord.
Laissez-moi vous rassurer.
J'écrirai une lettre au Roi
et au conseil en votre faveur,
et vous la montrerai
avant de partir.
Alors, nous devons partir.
Oui, c'est le commandement du Roi.
Alors je dis...
Dieu ait pitié de nous.
Dieu vous bénisse et vous garde,
mon cher mari.
Vous aussi mes chéries,
mais j'irai bien...
j'ai fait confiance
à l'honnêteté de Sa Grâce.
Il m'a montré une lettre
destinée au conseil
à notre propos et c'était très bien.
Il disait être bienveillant
à notre égard.
Et je doute
que du mal nous soit fait.
Après tout, qu'y aurait-il à gagner
quand le Nord semble
apaisé et silencieux.
Alors, ma fille, ne pleure pas.
Tu es une fille du Yorkshire.
Les filles du Yorkshire ont du fer
dans l'âme.
Tout comme ta bonne mère.
Vous me reverrez bientôt,
je le promets.
<i>Dieu vous bénisse, M. Aske.</i>
<i>Dieu vous bénisse, M. Aske.</i>
Dieu vous bénisse, M. Aske.
Vous mangez encore
des oeufs de caille, ma chère ?
N'en avez-vous pas pris hier ?
Si, Votre Majesté.
Il semble que je les aime
vraiment beaucoup.
Vraiment beaucoup ?
En effet.
Je veux des oeufs de caille
plus que tout.
Laissez-nous.
Je pense que vous êtes enceinte.
Je le suis.
Mon amour.
Ma reine.
John Constable,
vous êtes un infâme et incurable
traître envers Sa Majesté le Roi.
Rien ne peut vous sauver.
Seigneur, pardonnez-moi, Seigneur.
Gardes, allongez-le sur la table.
Doux Jésus, Seigneur, Jésus,
Allez au diable...
... Lord Darcy, Votre Grâce,
le voyage l'a presque tué.
On s'occupe de son logement.
Voici Sir Francis Bryan.
M. Aske.
Sir Francis.
J'ai l'ordre de vous emmener
à la tour.
Pour votre propre sécurité.
Vous y serez logé
assez confortablement.
M. Cromwell désire vous poser
quelques questions.
- Je vous faisais confiance.
- Je vous jure...
J'ai fait de mon mieux, M. Aske.
Le duc de Suffolk, my Lord.
Vous m'avez mandé.
Oui, Votre Grâce.
Expliquez-vous, que voulez-vous ?
J'ai des rapports.
Comme toujours, Cromwell.
Mais ceux-ci sont très intéressants.
Ils proviennent de Carlisle
et mentionnent
un jugement contre les rebelles
qui ont menacé Sa Majesté.
Tout a été fait légalement.
74 rebelles jugés et pendus.
C'est le problème.
Nous savons qu'il y avait au moins
40000 rebelles armés sur le terrain
pourtant Votre Grâce n'a trouvé
que 74 coupables.
J'ai pendu les plus coupables
et les meneurs de la rébellion.
Étiez-vous présent lors du procès ?
Je dois l'avouer à Votre Grâce,
on vous accuse de trop grande
indulgence envers les rebelles,
les moines récalcitrants et autres
défenseurs de l'ancienne religion.
On se demande
si vous êtes coeur et âme
pleinement engagé
contre les traîtres
et les rebelles ou si vous êtes
au fond de vous
encore papiste.
Qui m'accuse ?
Sa Majesté.
Elle exige donc
que vous retourniez vers le nord
et exerciez des représailles
efficaces contre ces traîtres
rebelles.
Vous devez en faire
des exemples effroyables
et leur apprendre
les vertus de la loyauté.
Soixante-quatorze est un...
nombre dérisoire.
Votre Grâce.
Vous me demandez la vérité,
je vous réponds
que partout dans le royaume
les hommes ont été très blessés
par la destruction des abbayes,
car ils pensaient,
peut-être avec raison,
que c'était le début
de la destruction
de toute leur religion.
Dans votre lettre
du 19 janvier,
vous écrivez
pour rassurer le maire de Pontefract
"Je resterai fidèle à Dieu et au Roi
et mettrai tout en oeuvre
dans l'intérêt
du Commonwealth."
Vous avez signé T. Darcy ?
Je m'en souviens,
mais je ne vois pas
en quoi c'est mal.
Êtes-vous d'accord...
que c'était plutôt répandre
la folie ?
Par exemple,
les églises paroissiales
que nous allons détruire
ont causé la rébellion.
Non, c'est parce que
les abbayes étaient détruites
et incendiées.
C'était le 19 janvier,
après le Pardon du Roi
et la fin de la rébellion.
Mais le Roi était aussi d'accord
pour un Parlement libre
où les sujets pourraient réclamer.
- Ma lettre voulait seulement...
- Je vais vous le dire, My Lord.
Elle signifie
que même après le Pardon du Roi,
vous avez gardé
vos idées de traître.
Vous cherchez l'annulation de lois
faites pour le bien du Commonwealth
et vous souhaitez renverser le Roi.
Dites-moi...
pourquoi...
étaient-elles si importantes ?
Parce que les abbayes du nord
ont donné des armes aux pauvres
et la foi pour servir Dieu.
Elles étaient une des beautés
de ce royaume
pour nous tous
comme pour les étrangers.
Elles s'occupaient de leurs serviteurs
et des métayers,
et de la communauté locale
de toutes les façons.
De l'entretien des ponts
et des digues
à l'éducation des filles et des garçons
dans la Vertu.
Et quand elles étaient debout,
le peuple pouvait refaire
ses forces physiques,
mais il avait aussi
un refuge spirituel.
Donc vous désapprouvez
cette suppression
et la suprématie du roi.
Après cette confession,
que le Seigneur me pardonne.
Ce n'est pas M. Aske mais vous,
qui êtes la source
et la cause principale
de la rébellion.
Vous pourriez sans doute
trouver des moyens
de supprimer tous les nobles du royaume,
si vous le vouliez.
Pourtant, il pourrait en rester un
qui vous supprimerait.
Vous seriez surpris d'apprendre,
M. Aske,
qu'il y a une raison pour que
j'essaie de vous sauver.
Vous êtes ici depuis deux jours,
et vous ne me parlez toujours pas.
Bien que vous soyez malheureux.
Qu'en savez-vous ?
Vous vous réveillez la nuit.
- Vous parlez.
- Que dis-je ?
Soulagez votre coeur.
Si je le fais...
croyez-moi...
tout changera.
J'ai ordre de retourner dans le nord
pour appliquer le châtiment.
Je dois exécuter plus de rebelles.
Mais cette fois,
il y aura de "bons" procès.
Beaucoup ?
Beaucoup.
Beaucoup, des centaines...
des milliers,
je dois tuer des centaines d'hommes,
femmes et enfants
ou je perdrai l'amour de mon roi.
Des femmes, des enfants ?
Je n'ai pas le choix.
Si, vous avez le choix !
Si c'était vos propres enfants ?
Je devrais quand même le faire.
Sa Majesté le Roi.
Relevez-vous, M. Aske.
M. Cromwell m'a rapporté
vos paroles.
Je suis venu vous parler
des abbayes et des maisons religieuses
dont vous vous souciez tant.
Je vous prie.
Vous avez tant d'affection
pour ces moines.
Mais je peux vous prouver
qu'ils sont loin des bons religieux.
Ils prétendent vivre dans la pauvreté,
la chasteté et l'obéissance.
Cependant ils possèdent beaucoup
et se mettent eux-mêmes hors la loi.
Ce sont des princes de la religion.
Pourtant sous notre responsabilité.
Et la pauvreté volontaire ?
Et pour l'obéissance...
que Dieu nous aide.
Comment être obéissants
en désobligeant leur souverain,
à qui, par les lois de Dieu,
ils doivent obéir en tout ?
Ces hommes ne sont pas
de bons religieux
abandonnant les possessions terrestres
comme ils le prétendent.
Mais plutôt des vagabonds...
oisifs et robustes.
Je vous apprécie, M. Aske.
Vous vous trompez
dans certains domaines, oui, mais
vos erreurs sont honnêtes.
Je sais que dans votre coeur,
vous êtes le plus loyal de tous.
J'aime et respecte Votre Majesté
par-dessus tout.
Je ne cherche pas à vous offenser.
Majesté,
le messager de Calais est là.
- Majesté.
- Monsieur. Montrez-moi.
Majesté.
Des oeufs de caille, Sir Francis,
pour nourrir la reine. Monsieur.
The Tudors Season 3 Episode 3
How in God's name, we suppose to bannish by adultery
and superstition and empty ritual from our churches
when they are still practice here at court.
When shall I meet the Majesty, my lord?
very soon. Majesty is most eager to talk to you.
In the meantime, he encouraged you to write a lengthy declaration of
everything you did during the rebellion and the reasons for it.
Keep still.
who are you? what are you doing here.
You can't be here.
Oh my God, it's true. I didn't believe it.
get out. get out.
no. she is my fiancee.
- well, should I...?	-No, I don't...
There's no cause being here.
I warned you.
Is he alive?
Master Holbein.
- Master Holbein. - Your Majesty.
I must beg Your Majesty's pardon.
Pardon? What for?
I have committed an assault within the verge of your court.
An assault? you? But you're an artist.
I was painting the picture of Lady Misseldon that Your Majesty commisioned,
but a gentleman interrupted us.
What did you do?
I threw the gentleman into some shelves.
You did the right thing, Master Holbein.
And I'll forgive you freely, I might have done the same thing myself.
Just finish the portrait. I can't wait.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Master Holbein.
Sir Robert Tavistock.
-Sir Robert, you look have assaults. -Your Majesty
I have a great complaints to make against Master Holbein.
I am engaged to a young woman.
but found him painting her. Naked.
Naked?
Yes, Your Majesty. on a bed, like some concubine.
I demanded that, Your Majesty, punish Mr. Holbein severely,for his lewdness,
his immorality, and his violence against me.
You have not to do with Mr Holbein, but with me.
I tell you frankly.
If I have seven peasants, I can make seven lords.
but if I have seven lords, I couldn't make one Holbein.
Then tell me truthfully, do you still wish me to punish Mr. Holbein?
No, Your Majesty. I ask for Your Majesty's pardon.
I am Your Majesty's humble and obedient servant,
and make no complaints against Mr. Holbein.
Good lad.
Happy Christmas, Robert.
- Majesty? - Sweetheart.
May I present someone to you?
Very well.
The Countess of Salisbury was my old governess
I know. I know the Lady very well.
- Lady Margaret?	- Your Majesty.
You are very welcome here to court.
I know how rearly you quit your fine house.
It is true.
I prefer to live a life based on piety and traditional ways, Your Majesty.
You're an example to everyone here at court.
How was your son, Reginald Pole?
Is he still studying in Italy?
Yes, indeed, Your Majesty.
He is now at Padua Univeristy,
and has more reasons than most to be grateful to Your Majesty.
Since until very recently, you continue to pay his fees.
I showed great interest in him.
He showed great promise as scholar, as well as being my cousin,
Still, when you refused my offer to make him the youngest
ever Bishop of Winchester.
I remeber I had to thump him.
Your Majesty must believe it was not in gratitude on Reginald's part. No, no.
He was in tears after leaving Your Majesty's presence.
The truth is my son is too much of a scholar
and private person ever to desire public office or notoriety.
Then after all, I forgive him.
- Majesty.  - Lady Salisbury.
You ladies are conspiring something.
we were both like to present someone else to Your Majesty at this Christmastide.
Very well.
Your Majesty, this is...
My daughter Elizabeth. You don't need to tell me.
Come here, child.
Votre Majeste.
ca va
ca va bien, ma petite.
veniez ici
attencion
joyeux son famille
Your Majesty, Mr. Robert Aske.
- Majesty.	- Mr.Aske.
Come.
I am very glad to see you, Mr. Aske.
For a long time, I believed I was badly misinformed
about the causes of disturbances in the Northern part of our kingdom.
but I have read your full and frank explanation.
I am persuaded by the justice of your cause.
I still deem the commonwealth of the realm, and love of my subjects,
Mr. Aske, far more than any riches
I'm truely humbled by Your Majesty's words.
and ask in all you ability.
If your sacred Majesty intends to fulfill those pledges made in Your Majesty's name,
by his grace, the Duke of Suffolk at Pontefract.
In every part, the general and liberal pardon
shall be extended to all our Northern subjects.
There will be a free election to a Parliament to be held at York.
when members of churchmen without our displeasure,
shall them may speak and show their learning and their free minds.
Futhermore, after my Lord Suffolk has come down to you
with the great seal to claim on this,
then to show the great love we bear on the Northern subjects.
we ourselves shall come to York.
and it is there, Mr. Aske, where my Queen shall be crowned.
Your Majesty is truely gracious.
I swear to you. You will find no more loving and loyal people
on the whole of your realm than Northern Yorkshire.
One more thing. You've written against some of my advisors,
and protesting at their lack of noble blood.
Your Majesty, I...
No, I agree with you. But don't say anything.
Now, I have a gift for you.
Majesty, I...
Happy Christmas, Mr. Aske.
That is quite entertaining.
but you don't even know who I am, do you?
Of course, I do.
You're Edward Seymour's wife.
If he ever discovered us, he'd probably kill you.
Really? Yet he seems so nice.
Cold, perhaps but pleasant with all?
That's a mistake they all make.
Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum, Amen
Mr. Aske.
Lady Mary.
I'm sorry to disturb your prayers.
Not at all, since you are always a part of them.
I come only to assure you, Mr. Aske.
For i know you are here upon God's work.
I trust the King's Majesty will grant you and your people all their desires.
I have every hope now,
as i have ever hoped one day you will succeed as Queen of England,
for the better maintaining of our faith.
Lady, you must know,
how beloved you are to the people,
as was your mother before you. God rest her soul.
Remember me by this.
May God bless and keep you, Master Aske.
How's father? They told me he has fallen ill
I was going tell you at a better time. Father is dead.
Dead? When? Why?
Keep smiling.  A week ago.
-A week? - Yes a week.
I arrange the funeral,everything has done to honor him.
You should have told me. I should have been there.
I wish I could be otherwise, but can't now,
your place is here,you have to understand that.
Later you could visit his mausoleum
-Sister.  - My Lady.
I presume you have told her about her father, is she alright
Of course. She's the queen.
Gentlemen.  Noble and worshipful man of this country.
I swear by the faith that I bear to God and St. George that i have not only
forgiven and pardoned the men of the North by writing under seal
but also freely in my heart.
It is my honor that those men now wear the cross of St. George
who thankfully accepted my free pardon
and mean to be as loyal subjects, as they were before their solely insurrection.
And my queen and I, wish you all, a very happy and prosperous New Year.
I tell you frankly, the King is a good and gracious lord
who has granted us as far as he may, all our desires and petitions.
It's true. I heard it from his own mouth
that he intends to hold a free and fair parliament in York
and have the queen crowned there.
Promises, Mr. Aske, just more promises.
No, not just promises.
Lord Suffolk is sworn to come here to bring both great authority,
the King's seal and thus he told me many comfortable answers.
I have to tell you, Mr. Aske, though it agrees me to do so,
that since you have been away,
there have been many rumors and a widespread
mistrust of the King and his councel.
Aye. The Northern lands are open monastery again
and this time we won't be betrayed.
Tell them to believe me, John.
Tell them to wait for the coming of Lord Suffolk,
for another rising now risks everything.
Robert, there was a time when nothing was more sure
than a promise of a prince, but now
we think these promises nothing but a policy to blind the people.
and when we rise again, we will trust no promises.
I cannot believe this.
If you will not trust the King, then will you at least trust me?
Have I not guided you well so far?
Have I not secured a pardon for all of us?
But have you secured the King's absolute promise to restore our monasteries?
His Grace promised me that all those matters would be discussed
freely and openly in parliament.
I trust him. He offered me as much as true and honest
and good man could desire of their sovereign.
but we have no proof.
Where are you going?
Marching on Carlisle.
John, I plead with you, for the love of God, not to put this agreement
in jeopardy by false actions and rush judgements.
Their minds are already made up, Mr. Aske. Even before you returned.
There is no agreement just basically empty promises.
The King will not be moved by words but by actions.
We shall do now, what we should have done before.
gather the man.
I wish that Lady Mary lived at the court. I miss her very much.
Yes, and Lady Elizabeth.
Is she not the sweetest,cleverest, brightest child?
It's not have been easy for either of them.
and for all my troubles I'm glad I never have theirs.
Your Majesty.
Madam. I do not know whether to tell you, but
the King has taken Lady Misseldon as mistress.
He must do as he will. It is we, Lady Rochford,
must always honor and obey.
Donot leave trouble for me, for I have great reason to be happy.
The Duke of Suffolk, and the Lord Privy Seal.
You're going to North at once.
Yes, Your Majesty.
In order to establish due obedience, you will allow minister an oath,
to the leaders and gentlemen of Yorkshire and Lancashire.
They will acknowledge that they made other oath contrary
to their allegiance and to the great offence of God.
They must utterly renounce them
and swear to be our true and faithful subjects.
They must commit themselves to obey and even to spill their blood to maintain
all our laws and to assist our church commissioners in their duties.
If they will not take the oath, then there will be no clemency.
You will apprehend such persons where there is no danger to yourself. And they will,
by law, be judged to suffer execution.
Your Majesty, what are your instructions
regarding the setting of the parliament at York?
You may say there has been necessary delays.
Your Majesty, I...I gave them my word upon my honor.
Let me remind  Your Grace that rebellion
is the heinous sin which cries out to God for punishment.
It is the sin of the sin.
For wether is no right order, there is only carnal liberty,
sin and Babylonian disorder.
These wretched men have taken my whole realm without board
as they have taken me, Charles.
They have to and will be punished for it.
I agree with Your Majesty. If I might...
No you may not. You're low birth,  Mr. Cromwell, deems you're unfit
to meddle in the affairs of King's. You dismissed.
-Hey Charlie.    -Captain Constable.
So most men start together. You're in good spirit.
Aye, glad you are up for it
Good, the rest will be joining in us tomorrow.
We will walk in the carlisle, we will attack the castle as soon as fast
what we've got here
Rabbits.
Rabbits. So what are you going to do with that? Feed the five thousand?
Jesus! Charlie! Stay low!
out out
alright
Give him some water.
My God, what in God's name has happened?
We started together, Mr. Aske,near Carlisle,
ready and eager to,
assault the castle.
Then Sir Cristopher Dacre. and the Lord Suffolk,
came out of the castle with the men that brought these spears on those
and afterwards, men of bloody chains and captures, scalds
I saw my two boy slayed.
God help us.
Sirs we are broken.
What about Mr. Constable?
Captured.
My Lord.
We've got him. They broke their pledges.
-I mean to see the King.  -Yes, My Lord
We shall impose martial law on whole of the North.
-John Constable?   -Aye.
Do you deny that you acted as a leader in captains of this rebellion?
No. I'm proud of it.
You're going to be taken to London and examined further as your action's motives.
you mean tortured, you promised us a parliament,
but you lied. you betrayed us
You never meant to of everything, did you, did you, Your Grace?
Here are the names of those who refuse to announce their actions and sign the oath.
-How many?   -74, all to be executed, Your Grace.
It was all well done Your Grace.
You know that it is his Majesty's order to arrest Lord Darcy
Sir Ralph Ellerker and Robert Aske.
They are to be charged on suspicion of treason
but they must not know it.
Your Grace must surely know
that Mr.Aske Sir.Ralph and I
were firmly and factly and openly  against this new rising.
We believed and believe still in the promises
and assureties and good gracious of the King's Majesty.
It is also true that nothing can be done or imagined here against the King's Majesty
that I cannot let the council and you know of.
I am assured of your loyalty to his Majesty.
Nevertheless, the King requires you travel south
with me to explain this recent events
which seems so contrary to his expressed hopes.
Your Grace can see with your own eyes
that I am old and sick and unfit to travel
Allow me to speak openly to Your Grace.
although I love and trust the King absolutely
and know that he would always treat me justly and mercifully.
I can not say the same for some of his councillors.
I would rather fear to fall into their hands my Lord.
Allow me to reassure you.
I will write a letter to both the King and council in all of your favours
and shall we show you before we leave.
Then, we must go.
Yes, it is the King's command.
Then I say God has mercy on us.
God bless you and keep you, my own dear husband.
And you too my darlings, but I shall be all right
for I trust in the honestly of His Grace.
He showed me a letter, it was written
to the council on our behalf and it was all good.
He said he still charity for us and I doubt
any harm will come to us.
After all, what could be gained by when the North most now
be appeased and quiet.
Then our daughters don't weap. Your yorkshire lass,
Yorkshire lass have iron in their souls just like your good mother.
You will see me again soon, I promise.
God bless you Mr.aske
God bless you Mr.aske
Man,march on.
God bless you Mr.aske
I see you eating quail's eggs again sweetheat?
Did you not have those yesterday.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I seemed to have developed  fondness of them.
Especial fondness?
Well indeed.
For some seasons, I desire quails eggs above anything else.
-Leave. -Your Majesty
I think you are with child.
I am.
My love.
My queen.
John Constable
you are a principal and irredeemable traitor and villian against the King's Majesty.
Nothing can save you.
OH Lord. forgive me, oh Lord
Guards,hold him down on the table.
Sweet jesus, God, jesus,
Dame you to hell. ...
...Lord Darcy Your Grace I think the journey almost broken him
His lodge is taken care of.
This is Sir Francis Bryan.
-Mr. Aske.  -Sir Francis.
I have orders to commit you to the tower.
-but  -it's for your own safety.
You will be lodged comfortably enough.
Mr Cromwell desires to ask you a few questions.
I trusted you, Your Grace.
I swear, I have done my best for you, Mr. Aske.
The Duke of Suffolk, my Lord.
You asked to see me.
Yes Your Grace.
Well explain yourself, what do you want?
I have some reports.
You always have reports Cromwell.
But these are very interesting.
they are reports from insides of Carlisle
where he says a judgement agaginst rebels who attempeted to threaten His Majesty.
Everything was done leagally and properly.
74 rebels were jedgued and hanged.
That's the problem.
one point all of us agreed there were at least
40,000 rebles armed and in the field
and yet Your Grace found only 74 guilty.
I hanged those with the leaders and most guilty insides rebellion.
Had you actually been there to hear the evidence?
I must be honest with Your Grace, you had been accused of too great
of leniency towards the rebels,towards
recalcitrant monks and other upholders of the old religion, it...
it is disreputed whether you are in your heart and soul
fully engaged in struggle against the treasons, rebels or Wheather you are
in your heart still papist
Who? Accused me?
His Majesty.
Consequently, his Majesty now demands your return North
and carry out an proper and efficient reprisals against these rebels and treators
You are to make a terribly examples of them.
And teach those parts of the virtues of loyalty.
74 is an inadequate number
Your Grace
Since you asked me for the truth,I will answer that in all parts of the realm
men's heart were most hurt by the destruction of the abbeyes
Becuase they thought perhaps with a reason that
this was the first fruits, of the destruction,of their whole religion in England
This letter of yours
on the 19th of Jan., you wrote to reassure the mayor of common Pontefract
"I should keep a clean true heart to God on the King
and whatever more further to be a true petitioner for the common wealth good."
You signed it.T Dacy?
I remember it. But I am not sure, what is wrong with it.
Can you not agree, was it rather spreading fauls foolingness*
for example,the parish churches we're going to put down which actully caused rebellion
No, it was the fact, that the abbeys were being suppressed and burned.
It was 19th of Jan that after the King declared his Pardon and rebellion had ended.
but I understood the King had also agreed to a free paliament
where subjests could still show their grief complains
my letter was only meant to
I will tell you what it meant, my Lord.
What it meant is even after the King's gracious pardon,
you had not changed your traitor's heart and opinions
You continue to seek the annulment of laws
that make for the good of the commonwealth
and you still wish to depose the King.
Tell me, why... they were so important to you?
Because the abbeys in the North gave arms to poor men
and Lord belief to serve God.
They were one of the beautiest of this realm
to all men and strangers are alike.
They took care of their servants, their tends,
and their local communities in every sort of way.
From maintaining bridges and seawalls.
to see girls and boys were brought up in virtue
And when they stood, people not only has world of refreshment in their bodies,
but they also have a spirtual refuge.
So you grudge this suppression and the King's supremacy
After such confessions, Lord forgive us.
It is not Mr. Aske but you,
who are the very oringal and chief cause of all this rebellion and mischief
although You could probably find some ways of having all
the nobal men's head of the realm struck off you if you wanted.
yet I trust, there might be on left
who can still to strike off yours.
well, may it surprise you to learn, Mr. Aske,
there is very reason, I attempt to save you.
You've been here for 2 days. But still you don't talk to me.
Even though you are unhappy.
How'd you know?
You wake in the night. You say things.
What do I say?
unburden your heart.
If I do, believe me, everything will change.
I am commanded to return North to carry out retribution.
I must excute more rebels.
Only this time I'll trial "proper" process.
Many?
Yes, many. Many, hundreds, thousands,
I must kill hundreds of men, women or children
or I'll lose the love of my King.
Women and children?
I have no choice.
Of course you have choice!
What if they were your own children?!
I will still have to do it.
His Majesty, the King.
Stand up, Mr. Aske.
Mr. Cromwell has reported your words to me.
I've come to talk to you.
About the abbeys and the religious houses you care so much about.
Please.
You have so much affection for these monks.
Yet I can prove to you how far they are from good religious men.
They claim to live in willful poverty, chastity and obedience.
Yet they mass possessions.
And put themselves outside the law,
They are religion princes.
*Yet but out our responsibilities.*
And what is willful poverty anyway?
And that's for obedience, God help us.
How can they be obedient
when they disobliged their sovereign Lord
whom by God's commandments they ought to obey in all things.
We should not think of these men as good religious men
who forsake all earthly possessions as they claim.
But rather as idle and sturdy vagabonds.
I like you Mr.Aske
You're maybe misguiding certain matters, yes but,
your mistakes are honest.
I know that in your heart your are the most loyal of all men.
I love and respect Your Majesty, above all things.
I would never seek to offend you
Majesty, the bellman from Calais is here.
- Majesty.  - Monsieur. Let me see.
- Majesty.  - quail eggs, Sir Francis, quail eggs,
To feed the queen. Monsieur.
You're bound by law to obey the King's Majesty.
And yet you follow the traitor Aske
Robert Aske, you've been accused of levying war.
We find you guilty as charged.
You do not deserve this. Stop it.
You are a good man Robert Aske
I want you to organize the celebrations for the birth of my son.
I want them to be truely spectacular.
- Is it time?  - Yes, Your Majesty.
I pray to Jesus he wills to send us a prince.
Your Majesty may have to decide soon between the life of the mother or of the child.

Avez-vous envoyé
Suffolk dans le nord ?
- Oui, Votre Majesté.
- Que lui avez-vous dit ?
Je l'ai exhorté en tant que
chevalier du Roi
de ne pas épargner mais de tuer
un grand nombre de ces rebelles.
Je lui ai dit de ne pas hésiter
- à verser le sang des traîtres.
- Et ?
L'Empereur va bientôt envoyer
un émissaire
pour discuter avec Votre Majesté
des candidats possibles
à la main de Lady Mary.
Qu'en pensez-vous ?
C'est le Bucintoro,
le bateau du Doge.
Quand il sera fini,
il emmènera la Reine
à son couronnement.
Alors ce sera vraiment
un évènement mémorable.
Bien sûr, il faudra attendre
que mon fils soit né.
Qu'est-ce ?
Un pamphlet, largement distribué.
Son auteur est Reginald Pole,
une connaissance de Sa Majesté,
qui a été dernièrement fait
cardinal par l'évêque de Rome.
Cardinal ?
Que dit-il ?
Il condamne Votre Majesté
dans les termes les plus vils.
Comme ?
Comme hérétique et...
adultère.
Autant pour la gratitude...
Malheureusement, ce n'est pas tout.
Mes espions me disent
que le même cardinal Pole
est maintenant légat du pape en France
et il a obtenu
une audience privée
avec le Roi François.
Il tenterait d'amener
les Français et les autres
à rallumer la rébellion
contre Votre Majesté.
Tous les ans, le doge de Venise
traverse la lagune
dans son bateau pour renouveler
ses vœux de mariage avec la mer.
Un mariage avec la mer...
Quel prince n'aspire pas
à avoir une telle maîtresse ?
M. Aske.
Vous avez été accusé de conspirer
pour priver le Roi
de son titre de chef de l'Église,
de chercher à le forcer
à créer un Parlement,
et enfin de lever des troupes
contre lui.
Tout ceci après que Sa Majesté
ait accordé son gracieux Pardon.
De tous ces chefs,
nous vous déclarons coupable.
Vous retournerez à York,
où vous avez joui
du plus grand triomphe.
Et vous y serez pendu puis exposé
en cage en punition
de vos atroces péchés
envers Sa Majesté
et envers ce royaume.
Votre cheval est prêt, Votre Grâce.
Père ?
Fils.
<i>Je sais que vous ferez votre devoir.</i>
Merci.
Allez vérifier les chevaux.
Je ne demande pas votre bénédiction,
Catherine.
Ne me laissez pas partir
avec votre malédiction.
Vous êtes un homme d'honneur,
et je prie Dieu de ne jamais avoir
à vous maudire
ou à vous offenser.
Mais je vous en prie,
soyez miséricordieux.
Surtout envers les innocents.
Sir Ralph Ellerker.
Sir Ralph...
Vous êtes accusé d'avoir pris part
à l'insurrection
<i>qui a tant offensé Sa Majesté le Roi</i>
<i>et tout le royaume.</i>
<i>Nous avons pris en compte
votre déposition à la Cour :</i>
<i>vous avez rejoint les rebelles
par crainte pour votre vie</i>
et celle de vos serviteurs.
<i>Nous notons aussi
votre serment de contrition.</i>
- Nous vous demandons de signer ceci.
- Qu'est-ce ?
Un serment.
<i>Vous jurez
que vous êtes sincèrement désolé</i>
<i>d'avoir offensé Son Altesse le Roi
par cette rébellion.</i>
Vous promettez de ne plus jamais
tenir une assemblée illégale
et aussi de dénoncer
ceux qui le feraient.
<i>Dorénavant, vous serez un fidèle</i>
<i>et loyal sujet de notre Roi,</i>
<i>notre souverain Seigneur Henry VIII,</i>
Roi d'Angleterre et de France
et chef suprême de l'Église d'Angleterre
sur terre.
<i>En échange,
Sa Majesté vous garantit son pardon.</i>
- Il y en a un qui bouge !
- Achevez-le.
- Faites place !
- Vous !
Arrêtez !
Arrêtez vos travaux, entendez-vous ?
... du Roi ! Faites place !
Arrêtez vos travaux !
Vous, arrêtez-vous !
Vous êtes des traîtres scélérats.
Vous tous.
Vous deviez, par loi et par nature,
obéir à Sa Majesté le Roi.
Pourtant, vous avez suivi
Aske le traître...
- Vous êtes les traîtres !
- Et vous vous êtes rebellés.
Et vous...
Mon devoir ici
est de faire un exemple
pour ceux qui désobéiraient à
Sa Très Gracieuse et Sacrée Majesté,
qui, après tout,
dans sa miséricorde,
vous a accordé son Pardon.
Après quoi vous avez poursuivi
votre désobéissance délibérée
et vos pensées traîtresses.
Pour ces raisons,
le Roi ne vous pardonnera pas.
Pas plus que Dieu !
Votre Majesté...
Mesdames...
Notre Père, qui êtes aux cieux,
que votre nom soit sanctifié,
que votre règne vienne,
que votre volonté soit faite,
sur la terre comme au ciel.
Pitié, Seigneur,
pardonne à ton serviteur
ses offenses contre ton troupeau.
M. Aske, mon nom est Richard Curwen.
Je suis prêtre ordonné,
et je suis venu vous confesser.
Puis-je parler honnêtement ?
S'il vous plaît,
ne trahissez pas ma confiance.
Jamais, M. Aske.
Demain,
je dois implorer le pardon
non seulement de sa Majesté Sacrée,
mais aussi de Cromwell
et des autres hérétiques.
Cela me soulève le cœur...
<i>Cromwell a dit ouvertement</i>
que nous, gens du Nord,
étions des traîtres...
Cela m'a tellement offensé.
<i>Et alors, plusieurs fois,
il m'a offert le pardon,</i>
pour avoir avoué la vérité !
Cromwell est le messager
du diable, M. Curwen.
Pourtant,
je dois demander son pardon.
Sinon, ils s'en prendront
à ma famille,
et je ne puis le permettre.
Il est déjà assez triste pour ma famille
de me voir pendu
et laissé à pourrir dans cette cage.
M. Aske,
avez-vous besoin de quelque chose ?
Quoi que ce soit
qui vous réconforte ?
Il ne peut y avoir de réconfort,
M. Curwen.
Je vais m'asseoir ici un moment,
et pleurer.
Et après cela, je me confierai
aux mains de Dieu
et à son aimante miséricorde.
<i>In nomine patris, et filii</i>
<i>et spiritus sancti.
- Amen.</i>
Attendez.
Quelque chose
est cousu dans mon col, ici.
Cela m'a été donné par Lady Mary.
Comme vous aimez notre cause,
M. Curwen,
veuillez le remettre à ma femme.
Cela soulagera beaucoup son fardeau.
- Sa Majesté la Reine !
Sir Francis Bryan.
- Majesté.
- Sir Francis.
Reginald Pole nous a montré
son vrai visage.
Je veux que vous alliez à Paris
protester auprès du roi, en notre nom,
pour l'accueil solennel et pompeux
qu'il a reçu.
Majesté.
Demandez-lui
de vous livrer le traître
ou d'en subir les conséquences
et notre hostilité infinie.
Et si le roi refuse ?
N'avez-vous pas été espion,
Sir Francis ?
Je l'étais, Votre Majesté. En effet.
Et hors-la-loi.
Vous pourriez remettre en œuvre
certaines de vos anciennes compétences.
En premier lieu, je voudrais voir
Pole pieds et poings liés
et emmené à Calais.
Et je le voudrais vivant
plutôt que mort.
Excusez-moi.
Que fait le Lord Privy Seal ?
J'imagine que ces nobles
veulent obtenir les baux
de certaines abbayes confisquées.
Que donnent-ils à M. Cromwell ?
Des pots-de-vin.
M. Cromwell est déjà un homme riche.
Le plus riche du royaume,
selon certains.
- Le Roi connaît-il cette pratique ?
- Il ne pose pas de questions,
tant que la couronne reçoit sa part.
N'est-il pas affreux qu'un édifice
sacré serve ainsi pour du profit ?
- Si vous le dites.
- Alors vous avez...
Vous devez comprendre
à quel point c'est malin.
En permettant à ces hommes
d'investir dans le royaume,
M. Cromwell s'assure
de leur loyauté au Roi
... et à lui-même.
- Stop !
- Je dois y aller.
- Et ?
- Je ne puis partir sans vous avoir...
C'est de la folie !
J'aime la folie.
Non. C'est trop dangereux.
Mon mari pourrait nous voir.
Et si je concevais votre enfant ?
Et alors ? Beaucoup de femmes mentent
sur les pères de leurs enfants.
En quoi cela vous importe-t-il ?
Laissons Edward élever
ma progéniture.
Admettez-le, madame,
vous vous plaisez aussi à ce jeu.
Faites-le...
- Père.
- Dehors !
- Père !
- Allez ! Faites-les sortir !
Oh, mon pauvre mari !
Mon pauvre mari...
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi vous ont-ils fait cela ?
Priez pour moi.
Je le mérite.
Vous ne méritez pas ça.
Arrêtez !
Vous êtes un homme bon, Robert Aske.
Je vous demande de prier pour moi
car j'ai gravement offensé Dieu,
le Roi, et le monde.
Dieu,
je vous ai offensé en ne suivant pas
vos commandements
et j'ai offensé le Roi
en transgressant ses lois
auxquelles chaque fidèle sujet est tenu
par les commandements de Dieu.
Et le monde, je l'ai offensé,
puisqu'à cause de mes actes,
tant de vies ont été perdues,
tant de terres, tant de biens.
Je demande pardon
à Sa Grâce, Sa Majesté,
ainsi qu'au Lord Privy Seal,
au Lord Chancelier...
Et Mon Lord de Suffolk,
qui m'a offensé,
je lui pardonne de tout mon cœur.
J'aime tout le monde.

Sir Francis Bryan ?
Laissez-moi me présenter.
Comte Talleyrand.
Sa Majesté le Roi François m'envoie.
Comte, laissez-moi
vous présenter mes compagnons.
M. Thomas Seymour,
frère de la Reine d'Angleterre.
Monsieur.
Puisque le Roi vous envoie, vous savez
pourquoi nous allons en France ?
<i>Oui, oui.</i> Je suis au courant.
Nous attendons de votre gouvernement,
selon les termes du traité,
qu'il appréhende
le rebelle Reginald Pole,
et le livre à nos hommes.
Malheureusement,
Sa Majesté a déjà accordé
à ce Reginald Pole un libre passage.
C'était donc un déshonneur
pour lui de vous le livrer.
Néanmoins, comme il a promis
à votre roi il y a dix jours
qu'il expulserait ce Pole,
- il l'a fait.
- Où est Pole ?
Tout ce que je sais
c'est qu'il a pu se rendre à Caserta,
sous la juridiction de l'Empereur.
Je trouve votre manière de procéder
vraiment étrange.
Je crains qu'ainsi,
votre maître perde mon amitié.
Là, j'ai faim.
Bonne soirée, Comte.
Au revoir, sir Francis.
Oui, très jolie.
Alors,
où est Caserta ?
Pardonnez mon ignorance.
En Italie. Au nord de Naples.
C'est une jolie vieille ville.
Je vous le dis, si nous trouvons Pole,
je ne le capturerai pas.
Je le tuerai de mes propres mains.
Votre Majesté.
Son Excellence,
l'ambassadeur Eustache Chapuys.
Excellence.
Vos Majestés.
L'empereur vous envoie
son affection.
Et il m'a chargé
de la grande responsabilité
de négocier avec Votre Majesté
un mariage convenable pour votre fille,
Lady Mary.
Qui le roi propose-t-il ?
Son Altesse Don Luis,
héritier du trône du Portugal
et frère de la femme de l'empereur,
Isabelle.
Quel genre d'homme est ce Don Luis ?
C'est un modèle
dans tous les domaines.
Un homme très intègre et vertueux.
Il a mené des campagnes militaires
et les a gagnées.
Un homme qui a une profonde connaissance
du monde.
Ma fille ne connaît pas le monde.
C'est une ingénue, une innocente.
Et elle est très pieuse.
Comment Don Luis la traitera-t-il ?
Comme une nonne.
Dans ce cas, il leur sera difficile
d'avoir des enfants.
Excellence.
L'empereur a proposé un beau parti
pour vous.
Son Altesse Don Luis a 24 ans,
il est d'une famille
très riche et distinguée.
Continuez.
Il est un des favoris
à la Cour impériale.
Des... femmes ?
De tout le monde.
Parce qu'il est honorable, vaillant
et enjoué.
A-t-il...
fière allure ?
Oui.
Je l'ai vu moi-même.
Il est grand,
avec des cheveux foncés
et des yeux bleus perçants.
Je suis sûr que votre mère,
Dieu ait son âme,
aurait approuvé.
Et tous à la Cour parlent de vous.
Ils disent que la Reine
a persuadé Sa Majesté
de vous réintégrer
dans la succession.
Pauvre Robert Aske...
On m'a dit que son corps est
encore pendu,
enchaîné, à la vue de tous.
Je ne devrais pas penser
à mon bonheur.
Chère madame, vous en avez
tout à fait le droit.
Vos Grâces,
en tant que chef de l'Église,
je suis fâché de votre incapacité
à vous accorder sur les bases
de la doctrine et de la pratique.
J'ai écouté vos sermons.
Je les ai parfois trouvés remplis
d'excès évangéliques sur lesquels
il n'y a jamais eu d'accord
et qui n'ont pas leur place
au sein de l'Église d'Angleterre.
Vos Grâces, je veux l'unité
et le consensus dans notre Église.
Je veux la fin
des différences d'opinions
et la généralisation
de l'uniformité.
Par conséquent, je vous ordonne
de créer une commission
parmi vous,
qui établira les bases de notre foi.
C'est Sa Majesté !
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Votre Majesté.
Ma chère, qu'y a-t-il ?
Tout va bien.
Venez.
Le sentez-vous ?
Il bouge !
Il donne des coups !
Je le sens.
Il est robuste !
Edward,
mon fils...
Sois fort.
Une couronne
que j'attrape le prochain.
Qu'y a-t-il, père ?
Le vois-tu ?
Qui ?
Là-bas...
Le vois-tu ?
Regarde !
Dis-moi que tu le vois.
Cet homme...
Il est là !
Tu le vois, non ?
Pour l'amour de Dieu, le vois-tu ?
Bientôt,
la reine sera à terme.
Vous organiserez les célébrations
pour la naissance de mon fils.
- J'en serais honoré.
- Elles seront spectaculaires :
des Te Deum et des feux de joie
à travers le royaume,
et du vin à volonté pour tous.
Et des tournois.
Avec la reine, j'avais prévu un tournoi
pour la naissance du prince.
Il a dû être annulé.
Cette fois, Votre Majesté
n'aura pas de raison de l'annuler.
Puis-je demander l'avis de Votre Majesté
sur un autre sujet ?
Pendant la récente rébellion
que, Dieu merci,
Votre Majesté a matée
en condamnant à mort
les pires vauriens,
certains se sont opposés
au Lord Privy Seal
qui en a été tenu pour responsable.
Franchement,
nous le pensions en danger,
tout en étant confiants.
Les rebelles ont exigé
la tête de M. Cromwell.
Et ce faisant, ils l'ont sauvée.
- Oui, Lady Rochford ?
- Majesté.
Lady Lisle m'a écrit pour demander
si Votre Majesté aurait
une place dans sa suite
pour une de ses deux filles.
- Je devais vous en parler.
- Avez-vous prévenu Lady Lisle
que la vie à la Cour n'est que
fierté, envie, dédain et dérision ?
Si oui, alors amenez-les-moi.
Et j'en choisirai une.
Souvenez-vous, elles doivent amener
deux tenues :
l'une en satin, l'autre en damas.
Lady Misseldon,
aidez-moi à délacer ma robe.
Elle semble rétrécir à vue d'œil.
Si quelque chose m'arrivait,
soyez le réconfort de Sa Majesté.
Majesté.
- Madame !
- Majesté !
N'ayez pas peur, mesdames.
Je crois que l'heure est venue.
- Lady Mary ?
- Majesté.
Promettez-moi de rester avec moi
et de ne pas m'abandonner.
C'est promis.
Alors tout ira bien.
Allez quérir la sage-femme.
Venez vous allonger.
Majesté ?
Alors ? Est-ce l'heure ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Que mon médecin aille voir.
- Oui, Votre Majesté.
- Allez quérir Lord Beauchamp.
- Et le Cardinal Gardiner.
- Majesté.
Envoyez des hérauts en ville
pour annoncer la nouvelle !
Et Cromwell, dites à M. Cromwell,
dites-lui...
Dites-lui qu'il en va
de l'avenir du monde.
Il arrive ! Il arrive !
Je prie Jésus, si c'est Sa volonté,
de nous accorder un prince !
<i>- Domine adjutor et protector
noster, adjuva nos. Amen.</i>
- Lady Mary.
- Oui, Madame.
Le coffret.
Il appartenait à votre mère.
Je pense qu'elle est ici, avec nous.
Je crois de tout mon cœur
qu'elle vous aidera.
Dieu éternel et tout-puissant,
prends pitié de nos infirmités,
et dans tous les dangers et besoins,
étends ton bras puissant
pour nous aider et nous défendre.
Par Christ notre Seigneur.
Poussez.
Serrez-moi fort.
C'est bien, Votre Majesté.
Demain, il y aura
une procession solennelle
à travers la ville.
Tous prieront pour la Reine
si elle est encore en travail.
Si c'est le cas,
que Dieu nous vienne en aide.
Je crains de perdre les deux.
Je suis réconcilié avec Dieu.
Je n'ai rien fait
contre ma conscience.
Servir le Roi est servir Dieu.
Je suis enceinte.
Elle ne va pas mieux.
N'abandonnez pas, madame.
Pour l'amour de Jésus,
n'abandonnez pas.
Votre Majesté,
j'ai parlé aux médecins.
D'après eux, il reste peu de temps.
L'enfant peut mourir,
sauf s'ils ouvrent le ventre
de la Reine pour le sortir.
Dans ce cas,
il est probable qu'elle mourra aussi.
Votre Majesté pourrait alors
avoir à décider rapidement,
entre la vie de la mère
ou de l'enfant.
<i>Kyrie Eleison, Kyrie Eleison.</i>
<i>Christe Eleison, Christe Eleison.</i>
Laissez-moi passer.
Votre Majesté.
Sa Majesté a accouché
d'un garçon robuste.
J'ai un fils ?
J'ai un fils.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Vous avez un fils.
Et un futur roi d'Angleterre.
Sois béni, cher enfant.
Notre fils.
Sois béni, fils,
au nom de Dieu,
de la Vierge Marie,
et de St George.
C'est un beau prince.
- Oui, il l'est.
- Et c'est notre frère.
Le Roi a longtemps
espéré avoir un fils.
Mais il nous aime encore.
Un garçon est plus important,
Elizabeth.
Je ne crois pas.
Au nom du Père,
du Fils,
et du Saint-Esprit,
je te baptise Edward.
Que Dieu te bénisse et te protège
tout au long de ta vie,
et te donne abondamment sa grâce,
par Jésus-Christ,
notre Seigneur, Amen.
Amen.
Dieu de grâce infinie
et toute puissante,
accorde une longue et belle vie
au noble et excellent Prince Edward,
duc de Cornouailles
et comte de Chester,
fils bien-aimé
de notre Seigneur redoutable
et bienveillant, le Roi Henry VIII.
L'état de la Reine
s'est rapidement détérioré.
Hier soir,
ses intestins se sont relâchés.
Nous étions sûrs
de pouvoir la sauver...
Mais pendant la nuit,
sa fièvre a empiré.
Nous avons tenté tout
ce que nous avons pu.
Mais Sa Majesté
continue de s'affaiblir.
La fièvre puerpérale.
Je le sais car ma mère en est morte.
Sortez.
Partez.
Majesté.
Majesté.
Restez.
Je vous en prie,
ne partez pas.
Vous avez tenu toutes vos promesses.
Ne me laissez pas.
Vous êtes l'incarnation humaine
de la bonté.
La flamme qui illumine
mon sombre univers.
Sans vous, la vie est un désert.
Une région sauvage et venteuse.
Je vous prie, Dieu,
dans votre bonté,
de ne pas me l'enlever.
Mon fils a besoin de sa mère
et j'ai besoin de ma Reine.

Have you dispatched
Suffolk to the north?
- Yes, your majesty.
- What did you say to him?
I urged him as a true knight
to his sovereign lord
Not to spare but frankly to slay
Plenty of these false rebels.
I said to him there was
no need for courtesy
- In shedding the blood of traitors.
- And?
The emperor will shortly
be dispatching an envoy
With authority to discuss
with Your Majesty
possible candidates
for the hand of Lady Mary.
What do you think of this?
It's the Bucintoro, the doge's ship.
When it is built,
the queen will ride in it
to her coronation.
Then it will indeed
be a memorable occasion.
Of course, it will have to wait
until after the birth of my son.
What's that?
This is a pamphlet,
widely distributed.
Its author is Reginald Pole,
of Your Majesty's acquaintance,
Who has lately been made a
cardinal by the bishop of Rome.
A cardinal?
What does it say?
It condemns Your Majesty
in the vilest terms.
As what?
As a heretic, and...
as an adulterer.
So much for gratitude...
Unfortunately, there is more.
My creatures tell me that
the same cardinal Pole
Is now in France, as papal
legate and has been granted
private audience with king Francis.
Apparently, he is trying to
persuade the french, and others,
to help rekindle the rebellions
against Your Majesty.
Every year, the doge of Venice
travels out in this ship,
into the lagoon, to renew his
marriage vows with the sea.
Marriage with the sea...
What prince does not aspire to have
such an elemental mistress?
Mr. Aske.
You have been accused of
conspiring to deprive the King
of his title of head of the church,
of seeking to compel him
to hold a parliament,
and finally, of levying war
against him.
All after His Majesty's
gracious pardon was granted.
On all these counts,
we find you guilty as charged.
You are to be returned to York,
where you enjoyed your
most frantic triumph.
And there hanged in chains
as a punishment
for your grievous sins against
His Majesty's highness
and against this realm.
Your horse is ready, Your Grace.
Father?
Son.
<i>I know you will do your duty.</i>
Thank you.
Now, go check on the horses.
I don't ask for your
blessing, Catherine.
Please don't send me
away with your curse.
You are a man of honor,
and I pray to God, I shall
never have cause to curse
Or disoblige you.
But I beg you, show mercy.
Especially to the innocent.
Sir Ralph Ellerker.
Sir Ralph...
You are accused of taking part
in the late insurrection
<i>That so wretchedly offended
his King's majesty</i>
<i>and the whole realm.</i>
<i>We have taken account of
your deposition to the court:</i>
<i>that you only joined the rebels
out of fear for your own life</i>
and the lives of your dependants.
<i>We also note your subsequent
vows of contrition.</i>
- We ask you to sign this.
- What is it?
An oath.
<i>You swear
that you are heartily sorry</i>
<i>That you have offended
the King's highness in this rebellion.</i>
You promise never again
to make unlawful assembly
and also promise to inform
against anyone else who does.
<i>From henceforth, you shall be a true</i>
<i>and faithful subject unto our king,</i>
<i>our sovereign lord Henry the eighth,</i>
King of England and
of France and on earth
Supreme head of the church of England,
so help you God.
<i>And in return, His Majesty
will grant you mercy.</i>
- That one's moving!
- Finish him.
- Make way!
- You there!
Stop what you're doing!
Stop your labors, do you hear?
- ... Of the King! Make way!
-Cease your labors!
You stop it, you!
You are traitorous villains.
All of you.
You were bound,
by law and by nature,
to obey the King's Majesty.
And yet you followed
the traitor Aske...
- You're the traitors!
- And rose in rebellion against him!
And you...
It is my purpose here
to show a fearful example
to those who would disobey
His most gracious and sacred
Majesty, who after all,
in his mercy, granted you a pardon.
Whereupon you continued
your willful disobedience
and traitorous hearts.
For these reasons,
The King will not forgive you.
And neither will God!
Your Majesty...
Ladies...
Our father, who art in heaven
hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Please, lord,
forgive thy poor servant,
his trespasses against your flock.
Mr. Aske, my name is Richard Curwen.
I am an ordained priest,
and I have come to
hear your confession.
May I speak to you
honestly, Mr. Curwen?
Please, do not betray my trust.
Never, Mr. Aske.
Tomorrow,
I must beg the forgiveness
Not only of his Sacred Majesty,
But also of Cromwell
and the other heretics.
It sticks in my craw...
<i>Cromwell has openly said</i>
That all us northerners
were traitors...
It offended me so much.
<i>And then, several times,
he offered me a pardon,</i>
For confessing the truth!
Cromwell is the devil's
messenger, Mr. Curwen.
And yet, I must beg his pardon.
Or else they will hurt my family,
And that I cannot allow.
Bad enough that my wife and children
will see me hanged,
and left to rot in these chains.
Mr. Aske,
is there anything you need?
Anything I can get you, for solace?
There can be no solace, Mr. Curwen.
I will sit here awhile, and weep,
And thereafter deliver myself
Into god's hands
and into his loving mercy.
<i>In nomine patris, et filii, e</i>
<i>Et spiritus sancti.
- Amen.</i>
Wait.
There is something.
Sewn into my collar there.
I was given that by the Lady Mary.
As you love our cause, Mr. Curwen,
Please hand it to my wife.
It will ease her burden greatly.
- Her majesty the Queen!
Sir Francis Bryan.
- Majesty.
- Sir Francis.
Reginald Pole has shown us
his true heart.
I want you to go to Paris,  protest to
the french king, on our behalf,
for the solemn
and pompous reception granted him.
Majesty.
Ask him to deliver the traitor
into your hands,
or face the consequences
and our perpetual enmity.
What if the king refuses?
Were you not a spy once,
Sir Francis?
I was, Your Majesty. Indeed.
And a breaker of codes.
Well, perhaps you could revisit
some of your old skills.
I for one would like
nothing better than to have
Pole trussed up and taken to Calais.
And I'd rather alive than dead.
Excuse me.
What is the lord privy seal doing?
I imagine those nobles
want to buy the leases
of some of the suppressed abbeys.
What are they giving Mr. Cromwell?
Bribes.
Mr. Cromwell is already a rich man.
Some say the richest in the kingdom.
- Does the king know of this practice?
- He asks no questions.
As long as the crown
receives its 10 percent share.
Is it not terrible that our sacred
building be used like this for profit?
- If you say so.
- Then you have...
You have to understand
how clever it is.
By allowing these new men
to buy a stake in the kingdom,
Mr. Cromwell makes sure
of their loyalty to the king
... and to himself.
- Stop!
- I have to go away.
- So?
- So, I can't go until I've had you...
This is madness!
I like madness.
No. This is too dangerous.
My husband might see us.
What if I were to conceive your child?
So what? Lots of women lie
about the fathers of their children.
What does it matter to you?
Let Edward raise my brat.
Admit it, lady,
this is your game too.
Just do it...
- Father.
- Out!
- Father!
- Go on, take them out!
Oh, my poor husband!
My poor husband...
Why?
Why have they done this to you?
Pray for me.
I deserve this.
No. No!
You do not deserve this!
Stop it!
You are a good man, Robert Aske!
I ask you to pray for me,
for I have greatly offended God,
The king... and the world...
God,
I have offended by breaking
his commandments in many ways;
and the king I have offended
by breaking his laws,
to which every true subject is
bound by the commandment of God.
And the world I offended,
since for my actions, so many
have lost their lives,
their lands, and their goods.
I ask forgiveness
of his grace, his majesty.
Also, my lord privy seal,
my lord chancellor...
and my lord of Suffolk,
Whose trespasses against me
I also forgive with a free heart.
I love all the world.
"This realm goes from good
peace and and quiet, daily,
to better and better."
"The traitors have been executed:
"the lord Darcy at Tower Hill,
"Aske hanged above the dungeon
of the castle at York."
"The rest were executed at Tyburn."
So that, as far as we can perceive,
"all the cankered hearts...
"have...
"weeded away."
Like this, exactly.
<i>Comme ça ?</i>
Sir Francis Bryan ?
Let me present myself:
I am count Talleyrand.
His majesty, king François
has sent me to meet you.
Count, allow me to
present my companion:
Mr. Thomas Seymour, the brother
of the queen of England.
Monsieur.
So if the king has sent you, you know
why we have come to France?
<i>Oui, oui.</i> I know.
And that we expect your government,
under its treaty obligations, to...
apprehend the rebel Reginald Pole,
and deliver him into our custody.
Unfortunately, his majesty
already granted safe passage
to this Reginald Pole.
So it would have been dishonorable
for him to hand him over.
Nevertheless, he promised
your king by letter, ten days ago,
that he would expel this Pole.
- And so he did.
- Then where is Pole now?
All I know is that he was allowed
to travel to Caserta,
under the emperor's jurisdiction.
It seems to me that your manner
of proceeding has been very strange.
I fear it may lose your master
the friendship of mine.
Now, I'm hungry.
Good evening, Count.
Good evening, sir Francis.
<i>Monsieur. Oh...
And bonnes vacances.</i>
Messieurs,
vos repas, s'il vous plaît.
<i>Monsieur...</i>
Yes, very pretty.
So,
where's Caserta?
Forgive my ignorance.
In Italy. North of naples.
It's a nice old town.
I tell you this, Tom. If we find Pole,
I will not truss him up...
I'm going to kill him
with my own hands.
Your majesty.
His excellency,
ambassador Eustace Chapuys.
Excellency.
Your majesties.
The emperor sends you his love.
And he has charged me
with the grave responsibility
of negotiating with your majesty
a suitable marriage for your daughter,
the lady Mary.
Who does the king propose?
His highness Don Luis,
the heir to the throne of Portugal
and the brother
of the emperor's wife, Isabella.
What type of man is he,
this Don Luis?
He is in every way a paragon.
A man of great integrity and virtue.
A man who has fought
military campaigns and won.
A man with a profound
knowledge of the world.
My daughter has no knowledge
of the world.
She is an ingénue, an innocent.
And she is a very spiritual person.
How will this Don Luis treat her?
Like a nun.
In which case, alas, it may be difficult
for them to produce children.
Excellency.
The emperor has suggested
a splendid offer for your hand.
His highness Don Luis
is twenty-four years old,
from a very rich and
distinguished family.
Go on.
I am told he is a great
favorite at the imperial court.
With... Women?
With everyone.
Because he is so honorable
and gallant and good natured.
Is he...
good looking?
Yes.
I have seen him myself.
He is tall, with very dark hair,
but piercing blue eyes.
I am sure that your mother,
god rest her soul,
would have approved.
And everyone at court
is talking about you.
They say the queen
has persuaded his majesty
to reinstate you to the succession.
Poor Robert Aske...
I was told his body
is still hanging,
trimmed in chains, for all to see.
I should not be thinking
of my own happiness.
Sweet madam, you have
every right to think of it.
Your graces,
as head of the church,
I am vexed by your inability
to agree on the fundamental
issues of doctrine and practice.
I listen to your sermons.
And sometimes,
I find them full of...
evangelical excesses
which have never been agreed upon
and have no place
in the church of England.
Your graces, I want unity
and agreement in our church.
I want diversity of opinion ended,
and uniformity imposed.
Therefore, I command you
to establish a commission
amongst yourselves,
to determine the basic articles
of our faith.
It's her majesty!
- What is it?
- Your majesty.
Sweetheart, what is it?
Everything is all right.
Come.
Can you feel it?
It's moving!
It's kicking!
I can feel it.
He feels strong!
Edward,
my son...
Be strong.
A crown I catch the next one.
What is it, father?
Can't you see him?
See who?
Over there...
Can't you see him?
Well, look!
Tell me you can see him.
That man...
He's there!
You can see him{\, can't you}?
For god's sake, do you see him?
In a while,
The queen will come to full term.
I want you to organize the celebrations
for the birth of my son.
- I would be honored.
- I want them to be truly spectacular;
Te deums and bonfires
throughout the kingdom,
And free wine for everyone.
And tournaments.
I had planned a tournament for
prince's birth with my last queen.
It had to be cancelled.
This time your majesty will
have no reason to cancel it.
May I ask your majesty's
opinion on another matter?
In the recent rebellion
Which, thank god, your majesty
has now suppressed,
And the worst rascals
properly put to death-
Great cause was made by some
against the lord privy seal,
Who in some quarters
was blamed for it.
Frankly we thought him in danger,
Whilst trusting he was not.
It was the rebels who demanded
mr. Cromwell's head.
And by doing so,
they saved it.
- Yes, lady Rochford?
- Majesty.
Lady lisle has written to me asking
If your majesty might find
a place in your household
For one of her two daughters.
- I told her I'd mention it to you.
- Have you warned the lady lisle
That life at court is full of pride,
envy, scorn, and derision?
If you have, then send them to me.
And I'll choose one of them.
Remember,
They must bring two sets of clothes:
One of satin,
the other of damask.
Madam.
Lady Misseldon,
help me unlace my gown.
It seems to grow
tighter by the hour.
If anything should happen to me,
be a comfort to his majesty.
Majesty.
- Madam!
- Majesty!
Don't be alarmed, ladies.
But I think my time
has come.
- Lady mary?
- Majesty.
Please swear, that you will stay
with me now and not forsake me.
I do promise.
Then all will be well.
Go fetch the midwife.
Come to the bed.
Majesty?
Well? Is it time?
Yes, your majesty.
Send my physician to watch it.
- Yes, your majesty.
- And fetch my Lord Beauchamp.
- And Bishop Gardiner.
- Majesty.
Some Heralds into the city
to tell them the news!
And Cromwell, tell Mr. Cromwell
Tell him...
Tell him that whole
worlds hang in the balance.
It's happening!
It's happening!
I pray jesus, if he wills,
to send us a prince!
<i>- Domine adjutor et protector
noster, adjuva nos. Amen.</i>
- Lady Mary.
- Yes, Madam.
The box.
It used to belong to your mother.
I think she's here, with us.
I believe with all my heart
she will help you.
Almighty and everlasting god,
Mercifully look upon
our infirmities,
And in all our dangers
and necessities,
Stretch forth thy right hand
To help us and defend us.
Through christ our lord.
You've got to push.
All four fingers.
Good, your majesty.
Tomorrow there will
be a solemn procession
Through the city,
All to pray for the queen if she
is still in labor with child.
If she's still in labor
with child, god help us...
I think to lose them both.
I am reconciled with god.
I've done nothing against
my conscience.
To serve the king is to serve god.
I'm with child.
She's no better.
Please,{\ my lady.}
Don't give up.
Please, for the love of Jesus,
don't give up!
- Your majesty, I talked
to the physicians.
In their opinion there is not
a great deal of time left.
The baby is likely to die
Unless they cut open the
queen's belly to release it.
It is uncertan
That she herself will die.
Your majesty may thus
have to decide soon
Between the life of the
mother or of the child.
<i>Kyrie, Eleison;
Kyrie, Eleison.</i>
<i>Christe, Eleison;
Christe, Eleison.</i>
Let me pass!
Your majesty.
Her majesty is delivered...
Of a healthy son.
I've a son?
I've a son!
Yes, your majesty.
You've a son.
And a future king of England.
Bless you, sweet child.
Our son...
Bless you, child,
In the name of god,
The virgin Mary,
and St. George.
He's a sweet prince.
- Yes, he is.
- And he's our brother.
The king has waited
a long time for a son.
But he still loves us.
A boy is more
important, Elizabeth.
I don't think so.
In the name of
the father,
son,
And holy ghost
I baptize thee edward.
May god bless and keep you
all the days of your life,
And give you abundantly his grace,
Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Amen.
God, of his almighty
and infinite grace,
Give and grant good life
and long to the right high,
Right excellent,
and noble Prince Edward,
Duke of Cornwall
and earl of Chester,
Most dear and entirely beloved son
To our most dread and gracious
lord, King Henry the eighth.
The Queen's health
has rapidly deteriorated.
Yesterday evening she'd
a loosening of the bowels
we felt sure
we could save her...
But during the night her
fever grew worse again.
We have tried everything we know.
But... Her majesty
continues to weaken.
It's childbed fever.
I know because my mother died of it.
Get out.
Leave.
Majesty.
Majesty.
Don't go.
Please,
don't go.
Just because you have done
everything that you promised,
Please don't leave me.
You are the milk of human kindness
And the light in my
dark, dark world.
Without you life is a desert.
A howling wilderness.
Please god,
in your mercy,
Don't take her away from me.
My son needs his mother...
And I need my queen.

Ma chérie...
Un jour, je reposerai à vos côtés.
Je le promets.
Et nous nous endormirons
ensemble pour l'éternité.
- Dégage le chemin, manant.
- Excusez-moi, voulez-vous passer ?
Bien sûr que je veux passer.
Vite !
Si je sais quelque chose,
c'est que vous êtes
M. Robert Packington,
membre du Parlement et ami
du Lord Privy Seal,
N'est-ce pas ?
Oui,
tout à fait.
Je vous prie de vous écarter.
Seriez-vous pressé ?
Oui, je le suis.
Pas la peine.
Ça, c'est pressé !
- Avez-vous attrapé le vilain ?
- Non, My Lord.
Il s'est enfui dans Cheapside.
Le sergent d'armes a déployé
ses hommes dans toute la zone.
Priez Dieu qu'ils l'attrapent !
Je suis sûr que M. Packington
était une victime innocente.
Pourquoi a-t-il été tué alors ?
Je présume que c'est un message.
Je ne suis pas à court d'ennemis,
M. Risley.
Il n'y a rien de plus difficile
que d'initier
un nouvel ordre des choses.
Alors vous pensez que l'évêque Gardiner
serait derrière cela ?
Ou Lord Suffolk ?
Je ne spécule pas.
Ce que je dirais, c'est que
des forces obscures sont à l'oeuvre
tant à l'intérieur qu'à l'extérieur
de la Cour. Elles doivent être vaincues.
Nous ne devrions pas agir avant
de savoir qui ils sont
et ce qu'ils veulent.
En attendant, trouvons
une nouvelle épouse au Roi.
Il est vrai qu'il a enfin un héritier,
mais un seul est à peine suffisant.
Il lui en faut un deuxième
pour être à l'abri.
Comment va le Roi ?
Il s'est coupé du monde,
tellement abattu par son chagrin
et sans personne à ses côtés
sauf un seul.
Qui est-ce ?
Majesté.
Qu'en pensez-vous ?
Je ne pense pas.
Êtes-vous fou ?
Penser est dangereux.
Juste clin d'oeil.
Idiot.
Quoi ?
Et vous donc !
Pensez-y...
Vous trouvez la femme parfaite,
mignonne,
docile.
Elle a même de beaux seins !
En plus, elle vous donne
le fils que vous avez toujours voulu,
et vous la laissez mourir !
Jésus, Christ miséricordieux !
Et vous pensez que je suis l'idiot ?
Et elle n'est pas la seule.
La pauvre...
- et délaissée Catherine.
- Attention.
Et cette autre...
dont le nom m'échappe
comme sa tête s'est échappée.
Toutes perdues ! Toutes perdues !
Va en enfer !
Là-bas ?
Je pensais déjà y être !
Pour un seigneur si charmant,
ceci est
l'enfer.
Pauvre garçon,
il ne connaîtra jamais sa mère.
Si.
Il la connaîtra.
À travers moi.
À travers d'autres qui
connaissaient sa douce bonté.
Nous devrions conserver son souvenir
vivant pour lui.
Il la verra toujours jeune et belle
quand il en entendra parler.
L'entourage de Madame
doit se disperser.
Le Roi lui-même semble chagriné
par sa mort mais il a ordonné
que tout soit fait
pour protéger son précieux joyau,
son seul fils.
Une nouvelle suite va être établie
pour lui à Hampton Court,
et j'en prends la tête,
responsable de son éducation
et de son instruction.
Je ne puis penser à meilleure
personne de confiance, Lady Bryan.
Peut-être qu'un jour, si Dieu le veut,
vous aurez vous-même un enfant.
J'ai entendu parler
d'un prince espagnol.
Oui, mais rien n'est fait.
En attendant,
je retournerai à Hunston,
et vivrai paisiblement à la campagne
comme il sied à une dame anglaise.
Sauf que j'emmènerai Lady Elisabeth.
La connaissant,
ce ne sera pas de tout repos.
Ça ne fait rien.
Elle et mon frère Edward sont,
à part le Roi,
ma seule famille.
Et je les chérirai tous.
Oh, j'ai oublié...
Comment va votre fils, Sir Francis ?
N'est-il pas parti pour le Roi ?
Oui, My Lady.
Mais je n'ai aucune nouvelle de lui.
Sir Francis, je suis venu spécialement
pour vous accueillir à Caserte.
Laissez-nous !
Puis-je voir
vos lettres de passage ?
Voici des lettres d'introduction
auprès du Prince de Naples.
Vous vous méfiez ?
J'ai besoin de voir ces lettres.
Et j'ai besoin de voir
le cardinal Pole.
Croyez-vous vraiment pouvoir
me menacer, Sir Francis ?
La porte est bloquée !
Ouvrez ! Ouvrez cette porte !
Ouvrez cette porte
Vous voulez protéger un traître ?
Je veux savoir où il est !
Vous allez me le dire,
ou, que Dieu me pardonne,
je vous tuerai.
Et cela en toute impunité.
Alors, est-il ici... ?
Est... il... ici ?
Où est-il ?
On le nomme
le palais de Sans-Pareil.
Pourquoi ?
Parce qu'il n'existe pas ?
Non.
Parce qu'il n'y a aucun endroit
comme lui.
Mais il n'existe pas.
Je le construirai.
Alors vous aurez construit
un palais imaginaire,
et il vous faudra
des gens imaginaires pour le remplir.
Ne sont-ils pas légion ?
Je le pense,
car vous en êtes un,
et moi, un autre,
et toute la Cour est imaginaire,
et tout cela est...
un rêve.
C'est tout ce que j'ai.
Rêvez.
- Bonne nuit, Cardinal Pole.
- Attendez.
Attendez.
J'ai grandi dans la peur
de mon ombre.
Le sceau papal.
Le Saint-Père l'a béni lui-même.
Je me sens en sécurité avec lui.
- Dormirez-vous sur le pas de la porte ?
- Oui, Votre Éminence.
- Bonne nuit, alors.
- Bonne nuit, Éminence.
Ne bougez pas...
Traître !
Il s'est enfui.
Chérie ?
Tout va bien ?
Oui.
Non.
Parfois je pense que je ne veux pas
de cet enfant dans mon ventre.
Mon amour, pourquoi dire
de telles choses ?
Je serai toujours hantée
par les fantômes d'autres enfants
assassinés.
Non désiré, non aimé,
à cause des souvenirs qu'il rappelle.
Il eut mieux valu
qu'il ne fut jamais conçu.
J'ai d'autres idées pour le palais.
Je construirai de beaux jardins
pleins de bosquets, de vallées,
de chemins...
Il y aura un bosquet de Diane
présentant la déesse dans son bain.
Des statues partout,
des fontaines, de l'eau jaillissante,
plus des oiseaux en marbre
qui déverseront de l'eau
par leur bec.
Qu'en dis-tu, bouffon ?
Tout ça me plaît.
Tout dans ce projet me plaît.
Sauf les bosquets.
Je n'aime pas les bosquets,
ni les fontaines, ni les chemins,
ni les oiseaux en marbre.
J'aime tout le reste !
Tu ne comprends pas.
Le roi français
possède un palais à Chambord
qui fait l'envie du monde entier.
Mais Sans-Pareil
le surpassera une centaine,
un millier de fois.
Alors...
avec le temps,
comme toute chose,
il n'existera plus.
Comme les ruines de l'ancienne Rome,
le Colosse de Rhodes,
toute chose tend à sa ruine,
même les grandes maisons
et les fous qui les ont construites.
Ainsi, dans un petit espace,
il y aura en effet eu le palais
de Sans-Pareil, mais il disparaîtra.
Un vide,
un néant,
un fort vert dans une ombre verte.
Et pourtant,
les gens verront
qu'un grand palais a un jour existé.
Un palais au-delà de la beauté.
Un palais au-delà de la comparaison.
Le Roi Henri l'a construit
et il existera toujours.
Certainement.
Les seules choses qui existent
sont dans la tête des gens,
et... on n'a jamais vu
tête si bien faite
que vous ne puissiez faire tomber.
À votre tour.
- Ne joue pas au fou.
- Pourquoi pas ?
- Tu perdras.
- Assurément.
Mais je préfère perdre au jeu
que perdre ma tête.
Bouffon.
Gawen !
Il est bien tard.
Ton maître Seymour est seul ?
De quoi as-tu peur ?
Pauvre Gawen !
Qui est-ce ?
Sir Gawen Carew,
un serviteur de Lord Seymour.
Pourquoi a-t-il été tué ?
Peut-être pour une dette de jeu,
My Lord.
Peut-être ?
Nous enquêtons.
Vous n'avez le tueur ?
Non, My Lord. C'est peut-être
l'un des serviteurs de Lord Suffolk.
Porter des armes à la Cour du Roi
est illégal.
Le châtiment est sévère.
Oui, My Lord.
Et pour M. Packington ?
- Avez-vous trouvé le tueur ?
- Non, My Lord.
Pour un homme chargé
de maintenir l'ordre à la Cour,
vous manquez singulièrement
à vos devoirs.
J'attends
que vous attrapiez le vilain
et préveniez toute violence,
sinon vous paierez le prix
de vos échecs.
Tout est en ordre. Vous pouvez
accompagner Sir Francis, Lady Bryan.
Merci. Par ici, Francis.
Maman.
Qu'est-ce donc ?
Le Roi a lui-même ordonné
que les pièces et passages
autour des appartements du Prince
soient frottés au savon
trois fois par jour.
Le Prince a aussi sa propre cuisine
où sont préparés ses repas
maintenant qu'il est sevré.
Tout ce qu'il pourrait toucher
est lavé,
et tout ce qu'il pourrait manger,
goûté.
Son chambellan surveille
ses repas, ses vêtements,
et son bain.
Il doit être le bébé le plus propre.
Il est le bébé le plus précieux
d'Angleterre.
My Lord !
Merci, Lady Bryan.
Que faites-vous là ?
Le Roi vous a-t-il exilé ici
pour avoir laissé filer
le cardinal Pole ?
Sa Majesté
est soucieuse d'assurer elle-même
le bien-être de son fils.
Ça ne devrait pas le préoccuper.
La protection du Prince
est aussi ma priorité
puisqu'il est aussi de mon sang.
Merci, Sir Francis, de laisser
mon neveu tranquille à l'avenir.
Ainsi que ma femme.
Me suis-je bien fait comprendre ?
Le Lord Chancelier.
Veuillez prendre place.
J'aimerais m'entretenir
d'une chose avec vous.
Vous savez que le Roi compte
rénover la plupart de ses palais,
et agrandir Hampton Court.
My Lord, j'ai déjà dispensé
des fonds pour ce projet,
et aussi pour la construction
du palais St James.
Il y en a un nouveau.
C'est une extravagance !
Cela coûtera une fortune.
Grâce à la dissolution
des monastères,
Sa Majesté a gagné une fortune.
Oui, mais aviez-vous pensé
qu'elle serait gaspillée
en extravagances ?
Ne pouvez-vous
- lui parler ?
- Richie...
Ce que le Roi veut, il doit l'avoir.
Il ne peut être contredit.
Il porte encore le deuil
de son épouse adorée,
et il ne parlera à nul autre
que Will Somers.
Will Somers ?
Son bouffon ?
- À nul autre que son bouffon ?
- C'est déjà arrivé,
quand il est bouleversé.
- Ce sera long ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Je voudrais le voir sortir sans lui.
C'est un enfer.
Bouffon dément, nous devons décider
quelque chose d'autre.
Nous devons choisir
les meilleurs articles de foi
et commandements
pour que notre Église, notre peuple,
demeurent
dans le droit chemin.
"Tu ne devras pas"... quoi ?
- Jouer au bouffon ?
- Frayer avec la femme du voisin.
Sauf si elle est très jolie.
Ou son...
serviteur...
sa servante,
le cul de la vache...
Ou le cul de la femme du voisin ?
Ne sois pas moqueur, bouffon.
Saviez-vous... Saviez-vous
que dans l'Exode,
il y a 613 commandements ?
Tu ne souffriras point la vue
d'une sorcière en vie.
Tu auras
trois jours de fête
chaque année.
Tu ne contrarieras jamais
un étranger.
Qui couchera avec une bête
sera assurément mis à mort.
Les enculeurs de moutons.
Les baiseurs de poules.
Tu ne vénéreras pas
le vicaire de Rome,
ni ne lui lècheras le cul.
C'est à toi
qu'appartiennent le règne,
la puissance et la gloire.
Amen.
C'est la doxologie.
La doxologie ?
C'est sacrément éblouissant.
Elle me manque.
Elle me manque tellement.
Je sais.
Mais ça aussi, ça passera.
Pourquoi continuer à vous réfugier
dans les ténèbres ?
Vous savez que la terre
d'un roi meurtri
n'est qu'une friche desséchée,
assoiffée de pluie
et de la grâce de Votre Majesté.
Monsieur ! Un combat a lieu.
Vous devriez venir.
Qui que vous soyez, arrêtez !
Posez vos épées, au nom du Roi !
Vous commettez une trahison !
Vous !
Lâchez votre épée !
Sous peine de mort,
déposez vos armes !
Vous avez entendu le sergent ?
Donnez-moi votre épée.
Très bien.
Allez.
Allez !
Allez !
Pendant que le Roi est indisposé,
personne ne peut prendre
de décisions en son nom.
Le Prince, mon neveu,
est sous ma garde,
et personne ne peut
le voir sans mon approbation écrite.
Il est le fils du Roi
et la propriété de l'État,
il ne vous appartient pas, My Lord.
Le Lord Privy Seal.
Mes Seigneurs.
Votre Grâce.
Ne peut-on rétablir l'ordre
à présent ?
De quel droit et sur l'ordre de qui,
monsieur le Secrétaire,
convoquez-vous le Conseil ?
Lord Hussey, comme vous le savez,
le Roi est profondément accablé.
Alors le fait que vous vous
placiez au-dessus des autres
est une imposture.
En tant que Lord Privy Seal, je pense
avoir le droit et la responsabilité,
<i>in loco parentis</i>, de convoquer
vos seigneuries au Conseil.
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen.
Admettez que le Conseil
doit se réunir :
en l'absence du Roi, il y a eu beaucoup
de malignité et de violence à la Cour,
y compris la mort
du sergent d'armes.
Vos propres serviteurs
seraient impliqués,
Monsieur le Secrétaire.
Certains disent
qu'ils les ont provoquées.
Si cela s'avérait,
je perdrais la confiance
de vos seigneuries.
Mais je peux vous assurer
que c'est faux,
et certains feraient mieux
d'examiner leur conscience.
Qu'entendez-vous par là ?
Certains aspirent au désordre,
pensant en tirer avantage.
M. Cromwell, vous supposez trop
pour un homme de votre extraction.
Tant que le Roi ne sera pas rétabli,
vous ne me convoquerez à rien,
même à un combat de chiens.
Pour l'amour de Dieu,
avez-vous des nouvelles du Roi ?
Oui, il réécrit le Notre Père, et...
les Dix Commandements.
- Quoi ?
- Absolument.
- Comment sont les prunes ?
- Délicieuses.
J'ai averti Sir Francis Bryan
de rester loin de vous.
Pourquoi ?
Il est dangereux.
Pas pour vous.
Pas avec l'enfant.
Le Roi l'écoute.
Cela le rend dangereux
pour n'importe qui.
Je dois le détruire.
Quelle pitié.
Il me fait rire.
Je suis sûr qu'il fait
rire beaucoup de femmes.
Ce n'est rien pour vous,
n'est-ce pas,
Edward ?
Il y a des choses plus importantes,
oui.
Sans doute avez-vous raison.
Mais tant que vous le penserez
n'attendez pas
que je vous sois loyale.
Puis-je avoir
plus de crevettes ?
Debout, debout.
Sa Majesté voudrait vous voir.
Tout de suite.
- Maître Cromwell.
- Majesté.
Des nouvelles du monde ?
Le Roi de France
a écrit à Votre Majesté
pour la féliciter
de la naissance de son fils.
Dites à François
que la divine Providence a mêlé
à ma joie l'amertume de la mort
de celle qui m'a apporté tant
de bonheur.
Dites à l'évêque Gardener
que je souhaite le voir.
- Je veux lui parler.
- Bien sûr, Votre Majesté.
Comment va mon fils ?
Tout est fait
pour le protéger,
selon les instructions
de Votre Majesté.
J'aime ce garçon.
Si jamais quelque
chose lui arrivait...
- Majesté, je songeais
- Vous songiez ?
Dites-moi.
À quoi pensiez-vous,
Monsieur Cromwell ?
Je me demandais si Votre Majesté
avait envisagé de se remarier.
Après tout,
puisque tout est fait
pour la protection du Prince,...
Cela pourrait me changer les idées.
Pourquoi pas ?
Que suggérez-vous ?
J'ai pris la liberté de confier à nos
ambassadeurs de France et des Pays-Bas
la tâche de se renseigner.
Et donc ?
Les Français proposent deux prétendantes
à Votre Majesté.
Marguerite, fille du roi,
et Marie, fille du Duc De Guise.
Notre ambassadeur chante
les louanges de cette dernière,
bien qu'elle semble promise
au Roi d'Écosse.
Majesté ?
Comment va le Roi ?
Il sort tout juste de son isolement.
Il se dit
que bien qu'il y soit peu disposé,
le Conseil l'encourage vivement
à prendre une nouvelle épouse.
Un mariage ?
Vous n'avez rien de nouveau
concernant mon mariage avec Don Luis ?
À ce sujet, Lady Mary,
je crains de n'avoir aucune nouvelle,
bonne ou mauvaise.
Cette affaire semble en suspens,
du moins pour le moment.
Mon destin est peut-être
de ne pas me marier.
Non, douce Lady.
Je suis sûr
que le Roi prendra la décision
de vous organiser un grand mariage.
Si ça n'est pas avec Don Luis,
ce sera avec un meilleur parti.
Vous sembliez dire
que Don Luis était incomparable.
- Madame, je ne voulais pas...
- Non, vous aviez raison.
Vous êtes toujours de bon conseil.
La maison de Jane est détruite.
- Où allez-vous vivre, Lady Misseldon ?
- Chez ma mère.
Qu'advient-il de votre fiancé ?
Robert Tavistock ?
Je pense
que je ne l'intéresse pas tant.
C'est donc un idiot.
C'est gentil de penser cela,
Sir Francis.
Est-il idiot
au point de rejeter l'anoblissement
ainsi qu'une abbaye dissoute
en refusant de vous épouser ?
Majesté,
mon estime pour lui fléchirait
s'il lui fallait cela pour m'aimer.
Votre Majesté est plus
que bonne et bienveillante,
mais je suis décidée à rentrer
pour voir ce qu'il peut advenir de moi.
Dans mon état d'esprit actuel,
vous n'auriez pu dire
chose plus plaisante.
Vous avez notre bénédiction
pour partir.
Une dernière nuit.
Le traître Pole vous a échappé.
Nos agents le recherchent,
mais il s'est enfui en Italie.
Il est sûrement assis
sur les genoux du Pape à présent.
Sa trahison me blesse.
Le plus pathétique est
que la sottise de ce dément de Pole,
entraîne un discrédit stupide
sur une si grande famille.
Si j'arrive à l'atteindre,
je jure de lui faire
manger son coeur.
Le Saint-Père vous a mentionné
dans ses prières aujourd'hui.
Il a remercié Dieu
pour votre libération.
J'ai cru mourir.
Votre mort n'est
pas pour maintenant.
Dieu a d'autres plans pour vous.
Comment expliquer sinon
le miracle de votre survie ?
Mon frère, Lord Montague,
m'a envoyé une lettre.
Montrez-moi.
"Je vous envoie
la bénédiction de Dieu
"et la mienne, bien que mon espoir
de vous voir me réconforter
"se soit transformé en chagrin.
"Je trouve incroyable qu'une tâche
confiée par l'évêque de Rome
"vous oblige à résider
avec lui cet hiver.
"Si vous gardez ce cap,
je dirai adieu à tout espoir.
"Que Dieu sauve votre mère
et votre famille."
Que dois-je faire ?
Cette lettre n'est pas de votre frère,
elle lui a été dictée par Cromwell,
le messager de Satan.
Ne laissez jamais le Diable vous charmer
par ses menaces ou ses promesses.
Le prix pour votre âme
est une vigilance constante.
Si vous baissez votre garde une fois,
le Diable
se glissera comme un serpent
dans votre bouche.
et ensuite, pour toujours,
il s'exprimera par vous.
Monseigneur,
vous et votre comité
deviez déterminer
la doctrine de l'Église d'Angleterre.
Or vous ne pouvez vous entendre.
Votre Majesté,
il continue à y avoir...
des différends fondamentaux d'ordre
théologique entre les membres du comité.
J'en ai conscience,
mais je suis devenu très impatient
et je ne tolérerai plus de désaccord.
J'ai élaboré six questions
fondamentales de la doctrine.
Les réponses formeront
les bases de notre foi.
Évidemment.
Comme il vous plaira.
Je vais immédiatement à Canterbury,
consulter l'archevêque.
Monseigneur,
épargnez-vous ce voyage.
Je pense que nous sommes d'accord.
Laissons l'archevêque Cranmer
à ses occupations.
Pas besoin de le déranger.
N'est-ce pas ?
Majesté,
voici les six Articles de foi sur
lesquels doit se construire et s'appuyer
- l'Église d'Angleterre.
- Lisez-les.
Le premier Article concerne la réalité
de la Transsubstantiation de Dieu
par la consécration du pain
et du vin pendant la Sainte Messe,
où la substance entière du pain
se transforme en la substance
du corps du Christ, notre sauveur,
et où la substance du vin
se change en la substance de son sang.
La peine encourue en niant ces faits
est le bûcher,
même après abjuration.
Le deuxième Article prévoit
de tenir le laïcat à l'écart
au cours de la communion.
Si nous leur offrons
le sang du Christ,
ils perdront tout respect
pour les Saints Sacrements,
et le pouvoir du sang disparaîtra.
<i>Quam oblationem
quaesumus tu Deus</i>
<i>ut nobis corpus et sanguinis fiat</i>
<i>dilectissimi filii tui.</i>
Le troisième Article confirme
l'obligation absolue
de faire voeu de célibat pour tous,
prêtres et nonnes.
Saint-Paul ne dit-il pas :
"Celui qui n'est pas marié
"a souci des choses du Seigneur,
il cherche à plaire à Dieu."
"Celui qui est marié a souci
des choses du monde."
Tous les prêtres qui sont actuellement
mariés doivent abandonner leur femme,
ou ils subiront la peine de mort.
Le quatrième Article concerne
le respect du voeu de chasteté.
Un prêtre fait voeu de chasteté,
et toute violation de ce voeu est
évidemment un péché.
Renier un voeu fait à Dieu
et se jeter
dans le gouffre de la fornication
équivaut à suivre de plein gré
le démon dans la bouche de l'Enfer.
<i>Accipite et manducate
ex hoc omnes.</i>
<i>Hoc est enim corpus meum.</i>
Le cinquième Article ici présenté
confirme la permission
de célébrer des messes privées
grâce auxquelles les bons chrétiens
pourront recevoir un réconfort
spirituel et matériel,
et la bénédiction de leur âme.
<i>Corpus Christi.</i>
Le sixième Article confirme
l'importance de la confession.
<i>Confitemini alterutrum
peccata vestra</i>
Confesse tes péchés à tes voisins.
<i>Sanguinis Christi.</i>
Quiconque refusera
de suivre ces articles
sera considéré comme hérétique,
comme ces extrémistes luthériens
qui parcourent actuellement le pays.
Le châtiment encouru
est la mort par pendaison,
noyade et écartèlement,
et, également, la confiscation
de tous les biens et propriétés.
Et quiconque
essayera de fuir l'Angleterre
à cause de ces nouveaux Articles,
sera accusé de trahison
et endurera par conséquent
l'effroyable sort réservé aux traîtres.
Merci, Monseigneur.
Vos Éminences seront récompensées
pour leur dur labeur
et leur grande sagesse.
Nous avons là
six Articles auxquels
nous pouvons adhérer.
Il y a un dernier amendement.
Dorénavant, le "Notre Père" sera
modifié et inclura la doxologie.
Car c'est à toi qu'appartiennent le règne,
la puissance et la gloire.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Messieurs, Éminences,
Votre Grâce,
maintenant que ces affaires
sont réglées,
poursuivons avec une diligence absolue
tous ceux qui s'entêtent contre nous.
Ce ne sont pas six Articles,
c'est un fouet à six lanières.
Cranmer doit envoyer femme
et fils en Allemagne,
ou il brûlera.
Il ne s'agit pas que de ça, M. Rich.
Messes privées, confessions, sang et
corps du Christ, sont des valeurs
catholiques.
Il a rejeté les changements,
c'est la fin de notre réforme.
- Pourquoi ?
- Car dans son coeur,
il a toujours été un bon catholique,
à l'exception d'une chose :
qu'il n'aura ni Pape,
ni Luther, ni aucun autre homme
dressé au-dessus de lui.
Previously on "The Tudors"
My own darling...
One day,
I shall lie with you again...
I promise.
And we shall sleep together
for eternity.
- Get out of the way... fellow.
- Sorry me sir, was you trying to pass?
Of course I'm trying to pass.
Quickly now!
If I knows anything sir,
you're Mr. Robert Packington, sir.
Member of Parliament and friend
of the lord Privy Seal,
aint that right sir?
Yes,
on all counts.
I'll thank you again to step aside.
Aint you in a hurry sir?
Yes I am.
No need.
This one in a hurry eh!
- Have they caught the villain?
- No, Milord.
He ran off into Cheapside.
The sergeant of arms has
his men all over the area.
Pray God they catch him!
But I am sure Mr. Packington was
in every way an innocent victim.
Then why was he killed?
I presume to send a message to me.
I am not short of enemies,
Mr Risley.
There is nothing more difficult
to carry out
than to initiate
a new order of things
Then you think bishop Gardiner
might be behind this...
Or my Lord Suffolk?
I don't speculate.
What I will say,
that there are dark forces at work
both inside and outside the court,
they must be defeated.
We must careful not to act til
we're completely sure who they are,
and what they want.
In the meantime we must set to work,
finding a new bride for the King.
It's true that he has an heir at last
but... one is scarcely sufficient.
To be safe he must produce another.
How is the King?
He's shut himself away.
So sad with grief,
that he's all broken
and have none attend him
but only one.
Who is that?
Majesty.
What do you think?
I don't think.
Are you mad? Thinking is dangerous.
But I'll wink.
Idiot.
What?
What about you!
Think about it...
You find the perfect wife.
She's sweet...
Pliable...
she even has good tits!
On top of that she gives you
the son you've always wanted,
and you let her die!
Jesus Christ of mercy!
And you think I'm the idiot?
And she's not the only one...
Poor...
- abandoned Catherine.
- Careful.
And that other one...
who's name escapes me
as her head escaped her.
All lost! All lost!
Go to hell!
Go there?
I thought I'd already arrived!
For surely gracious lord, this is
hell.
Poor lad,
never to know his own mother.
No.
He will know her.
Through me.
Through others
who knew her gentle kindness
We shall all keep her memory so green,
he will think it always spring.
And she still so young and fair
when he hears talk of her.
My Lady's household
is now to be dissolved.
The King himself seems very grieved
by her death but he has commanded...
that no effort be spared
to protect this precious jewel,
his only son
A new household is to be
established for him at Hampton Court,
and I am to head it,
responsible all together
for his nurture and education
I can think of no-one
who can be trusted more, Lady Bryan.
Perhaps someday soon God willing,
Lady Mary, you yourself will have child.
I hear some rumour
of a Spanish Prince.
Yes, but there is nothing definite.
And in the meantime
I shall return to Hunson,
and live quietly in the countryside
like an English gentlewoman.
Except I shall take the
Lady Elisabeth with me.
And knowing that young lady,
you shall no quiet at all.
I don't mind.
She and my brother Edward are...
excepting the King,
my only family.
And I shall love them all.
Oh, I have forgotten...
How is your son, Sir Francis?
Has he not gone away for the King?
He has, milady.
But alas I have no news of him.
Sir Francis, I came especially to
welcome you to Caserta.
Leave!
May I see your letters of passage?
These are letters of introduction
to the Prince of Naples.
You don't trust me?
I need to see those letters.
And I need to see Cardinal Pole.
Do you really suppose
you can threaten me, Sir Francis?
La porte est bloquée!
Ouvrez! Ouvrez cette porte!
- Ouvrez cette porte
You want to protect a traitor?
I want to know where he is!
You are going to tell me,
or god help me, I'll kill you,
and I have the immunity to do it.
So, is he here.....?
Is... he... Here?
Where is he?
It's called Nonesuch Palace.
Why?
Because it doesn't exist?
No.
Because there's no place like it.
But it doesn't exist.
I'll build it.
Then you will have built
an imaginary palace,
and you will imaginary
people to fill it.
Are there not lots of those!
I think so.
For you are one, and I another,
and the whole court is imaginary
and all this is...
a dream.
It's all I have.
Dream on.
- Good night, Cardinal Pole.
- Wait.
Wait.
I've grown afraid of my own shadow.
The papal seal.
The holy father blessed it himself.
I feel safe when I have it.
- Will you sleep outside the door?
- Yes, your Eminence.
- Good night then.
- Good night, Eminence.
Don't move...
Traitor!
He got away
Sweetheart?
Is something wrong with you?
Yes.
No.
But sometimes I think that
I do not want this child in my belly.
Oh my love, why would you say so?
I will always be haunted
by the ghosts of other children.
Murdered children,
unwanted, unloved
for the bloody memories it'd provoke.
Better it was gone before
it was ever born.
I have other ideas for the palace.
I'll construct beautiful gardens
full of groves, hidden dells,
paths...
There'll be a grove of Diana
showing the goddess in her bath.
Statues everywhere,
fountains, spouting water,
plus marble birds
pour forth water from their bills.
What do you say... fool?
I like it all,
I like everything about it.
Except the groves.
I don't like the groves.
Or the fountains, or the paths,
or the marble birds.
Everything else I like!
You don't understand.
The French King,
Has a palace at Chambord
which is the envy of all the world.
But Nonesuch
will trump it a hundred,
a thousand times.
Then...
in time...
like everything else
it will dissolve away.
Like the ruins of ancient Rome,
the Colossus of Rhodes...
all thing tend towards their ruin,
<i>even great houses and</i>
<i>the fools who build them.</i>
<i>And so in a little space,</i>
there will indeed be Nonesuch Palace,
but it will all be gone.
<i>A vacancy,</i>
<i>a nullity,</i>
a green fort in a green shade.
And yet...
People will see...
There once existed
a great palace there.
A palace beyond beauty.
A palace beyond compare.
And King Henry built it.
And it will all still exist.
True, true.
The only things which exist
are in people's heads,
and...
you never found a head so fine
but you could make it fly
Your turn.
- Don't play the fool.
- Why not?
- You'll lose the game.
- Indeed.
But I'd much rather lose game
than lose my head.
Fool.
Gawen!
You're up late.
Is your master Seymour, alone?
What are you scared of?
Poor Gawen!
Who is he?
Sir Gawen Carew.
One of Lord Seymour's retainers.
Why was he killed?
May have been for a
gambling debt, My Lord.
May have been?
We are investigating.
You have not found the killer?
No, My lord. Although is seems possible
it was one of Lord Suffolk's retainers.
It's illegal to carry arms in court
while the King's in residence.
The penalties are severe.
Yes My Lord.
Now my friend Mister Packington?
Have you not found his killer?
No, Milord.
No?
It seems to me, sergeant, that as the
man appointed to keep order in court,
you are singularly
failing in your duties.
I trust you will now apprehend
the villain,
and prevent violence,
otherwise, you will pay
the price for your failures
It's in order. You may take
Sir Francis through, Lady Bryan.
Thank you. This way, Francis.
Mama...
What's this?
The King's given orders personally
that all the rooms and cambers and
passages around the Prince's apartment
are to be scrubbed with soap,
three times daily.
The Prince also has his own kitchen
where all his meals are prepared
Now that he's weaned
from mother jack.
Everything that he might touch
is to be washed,
and everything he might eat,
tasted for poison.
His personal chamberlain
supervises his meals, his robes,
and daily bath.
He must be the cleanest baby
in England.
He is the most precious
baby in England.
My Lord!
Thank you, Lady Bryan.
Why have you come here?
Has the King banished
you to the nursery
for letting Cardinal Pole
slip through your fingers?
His Majesty
anxious to assure himself
of his son's wellbeing.
He has no need to be concerned.
The protection of the Prince
is also my first priority
since he is also of my blood.
I thank you, Sir Francis,
in future to leave my nephew alone.
And my wife too.
Do I make myself clear?
The Lord Chancellor.
Please take a seat.
There is something new
I should like to discuss with you.
You know that the King has seen fit to
start remodeling most of his palaces.
Including the enlargement
of Hampton Court.
My Lord, I have already
released funds for the project.
And also for the construction
of St James' Palace.
Well.
There's a new one.
This is a fantasy work!
It will cost a fortune.
As a result of the dissolution of
the monasteries
His Majesty has gained a large fortune.
Yes, but did you ever suppose
it would be squandered on...
fantasies?
Can you not...
- Talk to him?
- Richie...
what King wills the King must have
he's not to argued with or crossed.
He's still mourning the death
of his beloved wife.
And he will talk to no-one
but Will Somers.
Will Somers?
His fool?
- He will talk to no-one but his fool?
- It's not the first time.
In extremes, always.
- For how long?
- I don't know.
I wish he would come out,
without him...
we're all gone to hell.
Mad fool, fool there's something
else we have to decide.
We have to decide
which articles of faith and
which commandments are best.
For our new church, our people
so they can
walk in good ways.
"Thou shall not"... what?
Play the fool?
"Cover thy neighbor's wife."
Unless she's very pretty.
"Or his...
man servant...
maid servant,
Ox, ass"...
or your neighbor's wife's ass?
Don't be facetious, buffoon.
Did you know... Did you know...
that in Exodus,
there are 613 commandments?
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch."
To live..."
Thou shalt have
three feast days
unto me a year".
"Thou shalt never vex...
stranger".
"Whosoever lies with a beast, shall
be surely put to death".
Sheep shaggers.
Pigeon fanciers.
Thou shall not venerate
the vicar of Rome.
Or lick his ares.
For thine is the kingdom.
The power and the glory.
Amen.
That's the doxology!
The doxology?
It's the dog's bloody bullocks.
I miss her, Will...
I miss her so much...
I know.
But this too shall pass.
Why go on dwelling in darkness?
You know that the land
of the wounded King...
is only a parched wasteland,
thirsting for rain
and your Majesty's grace.
Sir... there's a fight.
You'd best come quick.
Whoever you are.
Hold!
Put up your swords in the name of
the King! You are committing treason!
You sir!
Give up your sword!
I say on pain of death!
Give them up.
You heard the sergeant?
Give me your sword.
Very well.
Go.
Go, now!
Go!
While the King's indisposed,
no-one has the authority
to make decisions on his behalf
The Prince, my nephew,
is in my custody.
And no-one is or will be allowed
to see him, without my written approval
He is the King's son
and the property of the state,
He is not your property, Mister.
The Lord Privy Seal.
My Lords.
Your Grace.
I beg you all can we not
now come to order?
By what right and by who's command,
Mister Secretary,
do you summon the King's council?
My Lord Hussey, as you well know,
the King is incommunicado...
Then your only authority to
put yourself above others
is a usurped one.
As Lord Privy Seal I think I have
the right and the responsibly
in loco parentis, of summoning
your Lordships to council.
Gentlemen...
Gentlemen.
Surely you can see there must
be a meeting of council:
In King's absent,there has been much
malevolence and violence at court,
including now, the death
of the Sergeant at arms.
I've heard that your own servants
were much involved in the violence,
Mister secretary.
Some say that they may
have even provoked it.
If that could be proved,
I should rightly forfeit
your Lordships trust.
But I can assure your Grace
it is not true,
and others should
look to their own conscience.
What do you mean by that?
There are some that desire
disorder with all their heart
thinking to use it the end
to their own advantage.
Mister Cromwell, you presume
too far above
very base and low degree.
Until the King is well, you will
not summon me to anymore to anything.
Not even to a dog fight!
For God's sake,
have you any new of the King?
Yes, he's rewriting
the Lord's Prayer, and...
The ten Commandments.
- What?
- Certainly.
- How are the prawns?
- Delicious.
I've warned Sir Francis Bryan
to stay away from you.
Why?
He's dangerous.
Not to you surely?
Not with the boy.
The King listens to him.
That makes him
dangerous to everyone.
I shall have to destroy him.
It's a pity.
He makes me laugh.
I'm sure he makes
a lot of women laugh.
It's a very small thing to you
isn't It,
Edward...
I think there are more
important things; yes.
No doubt you're right.
But as long as you do...
don't expect me to
be faithful to you.
May I have some more prawns?
Wakey, wakey!
His Majesty would like to see you,
at once.
Master Cromwell.
Majesty.
How goes the world?
The King of France has
written to your Majesty
to congratulate you
on the birth of your son.
Tell Frances...
Divine Providence has mingled
my joy with the bitterness of death...
of her who bought me such...
happiness.
Tell bishop Gardener
I wish to see him.
- I wish to talk to him.
- Well of course, your Majesty.
How is my son?
Everything's been done
to protect the Prince,
in strict accordance
with your Majesty's instructions.
I love that boy.
If anything should ever
happen to him...
Majesty, I wonder...
Wonder?
Tell me...
what do you wonder, Mister Cromwell?
I wonder if your Majesty could frame
your mind towards a new marriage.
After all...
however much is done
to protect the Prince...
Let me free my mind... why not?
What do you suggest?
I took the liberty of instructing
our ambassadors
in France and the Low Countries
to begin making enquiries.
And?
The French have proposed two
possible consorts for your Majesty.
Marguerite,
the daughter of the King,
and Marie, the daughter
of the Duke De Guise.
Our ambassador to France
sings the latter's praises,
though it seems... she is half promised
to the King of Scotland.
Majesty?
How is the King?
He has just lately emerged
from his seclusion.
It is said that although he is
little disposed to it...
the council is urging him to take
the extreme step of marrying again.
A marriage?
I don't suppose heard any more
about Don Luis and my marriage?
As to that, Lady Mary, I'm afraid
I have no news for you,
wether good or bad.
It seems perhaps the issue
is in abeyance
at least for the time being.
- Perhaps it is my fate never to marry.
- No, gentle lady.
No.
I'm sure the King
will make up his mind to...
to arrange an most brilliant
marriage for you.
If not to Don Luis,
then to someone even more eligible.
I thought you said
Don Luis was incomparable.
- Madame, I did not mean...
- No. You meant well
You always mean well.
Jane's household is now
all broken up.
- Where will you go, Lady Misseldon?
- To live with my mother.
What about the young man
you were engaged to?
Robert Tavistock?
I think he is not
so interested in me.
He is a fool then.
You're kind to think so,
Sir Francis.
Is he so foolish that he'll
turn down a peerage,
and a gift of one of the dissolved
abbeys... if he agrees to marry you?
Majesty, I would think less of him
if he needed to accept
such gifts in order to love me.
Your Majesty has been more
than generous and gracious,
but I'm settled in a plan
to go home,
to see what has become of me.
In my present state of mind...
you could not have said
a more admirable thing.
You may leave
with our love and blessing.
One more night.
The traitor Pole, escaped you.
Yes.
We've other agents looking for him.
But he was smuggled out to Italy.
No doubt he's sitting
on the Pope's lap even now.
His betrayal hurts me.
Pity it is...
that the folly of one brain-sick Pole,
or to save that one witless fool,
should be the ruin of so great a family.
That(***) I cannot touch you...
I swear I will make him
eat his heart.
The holy father mentioned
you in his prayers today
He thanked God
for your safe deliverance.
I was sure I was going to die.
Death is not ready for you yet.
God has something else in mind.
How else to explain the
miracle of your survival?
My brother, Lord Montague,
has sent me a letter.
Show me.
"I send you God's blessing...
"and mine, although my trust
to have comfort in you...
"has turned to sorrow.
"It is incredible to me
that by reason of a brief
"sent to you by the bishop of Rome,
"you should be resident
with him for this winter.
"If you keep that way
then farewell all my hope!
"And God save your mother
and all your family."
What should I do?
That letter was not
written by your brother,
but dictated to him by Cromwell,
the messenger of Satan.
Never let the Devil beguile you,
either with his threats
or his promises.
The price of your soul
is eternal vigilance.
If you once let down your guard,
the Devil will slip like a serpent
into your mouth.
And forever afterwards
he will speak for you.
<i>My lord bishop... you and your committee
were asked to examine,</i>
<i>and determine the doctrine
of the church of England.</i>
But you seem unable
to agree on anything
Your Majesty,
there continue to be some...
fundamental theological differences
between members of the committee.
I'm aware of that.
But I've grown very impatient,
and I will not tolerate
any more divisions.
I have formulated...
six fundamental doctrinal questions.
The answers to these questions
will form the basis of our faith.
Of course.
As Your Majesty wishes.
I shall go at once to Canterbury
and consult with the Archbishop.
My lord...
save yourself the journey.
I think we understand each other
very well.
Let's leave archbishop Cranmer
to tend his own garden.
There's really no need
to bother him.
Don't you agree?
Your Majesty,
here are the six Articles of faith,
upon which Your Majesty's
Church of England
- is to built, and sustained.
- Read them.
The first Article concerns the truth
of the Transubstantiation of God.
By the consecration of the bread
and the wine at holy mass,
<i>there takes place a change
in the whole substance of the bread</i>
<i>into the substance
of the body of Christ our Lord,</i>
<i>and change in substance of the wine,</i>
<i>into the substance of his blood.</i>
<i>The penalty for denying this
is death by burning</i>
even after recantation.
The second Article concerns
<i>the withholding of the cup
from the laity, during communion.</i>
<i>For if we offer them
the blood of Christ,</i>
<i>they will lose all their reverence
for the holy sacraments,</i>
<i>and the power of the blood
will be washed away.</i>
<i>Quam oblationem quaesumus tu Deus</i>
<i>ut nobis corpus et sanguinis fiat</i>
<i>dilectissimi filii tui.</i>
<i>The third Article prescribes the...</i>
<i>continued validity
of the vows of celibacy for all...</i>
<i>priests and nuns.
For, does not Saint Paul say:</i>
<i>"He that is without a wife,</i>
<i>"is solicitous for things of the Lord,
how he may please God,</i>
<i>"he who has a wife is solicitous
for the things of the world."</i>
<i>All priests who are now married</i>
<i>must now forthwith
desert their wives,</i>
<i>or face the penalty of death.</i>
<i>The fourth Article concerns
the observation of the vows of chastity.</i>
<i>A priest makes a vow of chastity,</i>
<i>and any violation of that vow
must surely be a sin against religion.</i>
<i>To turn aside a vow to God,</i>
<i>and to writhe
in the pit of fornication,</i>
<i>is to follow the devil
willingly into the mouth of Hell.</i>
<i>Accipite...</i>
<i>et manducate ex hoc omnes.</i>
<i>Hoc est enim corpus meum.</i>
<i>The fifth Article herein decided</i>
<i>is concerned with the continuation
of private masses</i>
<i>whereby, good Christian people,</i>
<i>may receive both godly
and goodly consolation,</i>
<i>and blessings for their souls.</i>
<i>Corpus Christi.</i>
<i>The sixth Article confirms
the importance of confession.</i>
<i>Confitemini alterutrum
peccata vestra.</i>
<i>Confess your sins to one another.</i>
<i>Sanguinis Christi.</i>
<i>Anyone who disputes
against these Articles,</i>
must now be considered a heretic,
like those extreme Lutherans
who now roam this land.
<i>The punishment for transgression
is to be death</i>
<i>by hanging, drawing, and quartering,</i>
<i>as well as forfeiture
of estates and property.</i>
<i>And any man...</i>
<i>who decides to try to flee England
in the face of these new Articles,</i>
<i>will be considered
to have committed treason</i>
<i>and suffer accordingly
the awful fate</i>
<i>handed out to traitors.</i>
Thank you my lord bishop.
<i>You Eminences are to congratulated
on your hard work,</i>
<i>and manifest wisdom.</i>
Here we have six Articles we may
adhere to with a clear conscience.
<i>There is one final amendment.</i>
Henceforth: the Lord's prayer will
be altered to include the doxology.
"For thine is the Kingdom,
the power...
"and the glory."
Amen.
Amen.
My Lords, Eminences, Your Grace...
now that these matters
have been determined,
let us prosecute
with absolute diligence
all those who stubbornly
stand against us.
<i>These aren't six Articles...
they're a whip with six strings.</i>
Cranmer ought to send his wife
and son back to Germany...
or be burned.
It's not just that, Mister Rich.
Private masses, confessions,
the blood and the body of Christ,
these are Catholic measures.
He's rolled back the reforms...
it's the end of our reformation.
- Why?
- Because in his heart,
he has always been a true Catholic.
Excepting just one thing:
that he will have neither Pope,
nor Luther, nor any other man
set above him.

Le combat entre factions

Je te nomme Président du Conseil

Ainsi, en mon absence,
tous devront répondre devant toi.
Pas Cromwell.
Majesté.
Je charge aussi Edward Seymour
d'enquęter sur les activités des Pole.
Ŕ partir de maintenant, ils sont
tous suspects.
Comme va ta famille ?
Ils vont bien,
sauf...
ma femme qui a perdu un enfant.
Tous deux avons perdu quelque chose.
Parfois je pense devenir fou.
Ma jambe est gangrenée
et me fait mal,
j'ai peur que mon fils meure de la peste
et le sommeil me fuit.
Majesté,
je sais ce que nous avons perdu.
Notre jeunesse.
Il n'y a rien au monde
qui puisse nous la rendre.
<i>Beneditione tuam Domine,</i>

Lady Salisbury.
Tu as faim. Mange.
- Arrętez !
- Écartez-vous,
le Roi m'envoie !
- Qu'est-ce ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Lady Salisbury,
pardonnez cette intrusion,
mais vous et votre famille
ętes aux arręts
sur ordre du Roi, pour trahison.
Vous devez tous m'accompagner.
Pas mon petit-fils.
Tous.
Je voulais vous parler en privé,
M. l'Ambassadeur,
car je pense prendre
une épouse française,
bien que me conseillers me recommandent
d'en chercher une dans l'Empire.
J'admire le bon goűt
de Votre Majesté,
et déplore celui de ses conseillers.
Peut-ętre ne sont-ils pas,
comme nous, des hommes du monde ?
Mon Lord Privy Seal m'a proposé
deux Françaises :
Maria, la fille du roi,
et Marie de Guise,
Madame de Longueville.
Puisqu'on m'a davantage
parlé de Mme de Longueville,
je ne peux m'empęcher d'y penser
comme ŕ une épouse.
Bon nez.
Excellent !
Peu alcoolisé.
Pas trop sucré.
Qu'avez-vous entendu ?
La fille du roi est trop jeune.
Madame de Longueville
conviendrait mieux.
Elle est elle-męme veuve
et a déjŕ deux fils.
Et elle est, comme on dit, trčs...
voluptueuse.
Mon maître m'a dit qu'il
considérerait comme un grand honneur
que Votre Majesté prenne
une Française pour épouse.
Il n'y a aucune femme
qui ne soit ŕ ses ordres,
sauf Madame de Longueville,
dont le mariage avec le Roi d'Écosse
a déjŕ été arrangé.
Cet arrangement peut ętre rompu.
Dites ŕ votre maître que je puis faire
pour lui deux fois plus
que mon neveu, idiot et médiocre
roi d'Écosse.
Oui.
Oui, mais alors,
vous vous marieriez
avec la femme d'un autre.
J'épouserai qui me plaira.
Monsieur Castillon,
j'ai reçu des offres
de toutes parts.
Pardonnez-moi,
mais Sa Majesté propose
un double mariage.
Son fils de 19 ans, Henri,
avec votre fille, Mary,
et une des soeurs
de Mme de Longueville, avec vous.
Elles sont deux : Louise et Renée.
La premičre, fait remarquable
ŕ la Cour française,
passe pour ętre encore vierge.
Merveilleux.
Prenez-la.
Prenez Louise.
Puisqu'elle est toujours jeune fille,
vous aurez l'avantage de
façonner le passage ŕ votre mesure.
Je veux voir mon pčre.
Allez chercher mon pčre.
Je veux mon pčre maintenant !
Vous savez qui je suis ?
Non ?
Oh oui ! Je sais qui tu es.
Tu es Maître Pole.
Un jour tu seras roi d'Angleterre.
Laissez-moi !
Laissez-moi !
Discutons mariage.
Comme d'habitude, le Français
me contrarie.
Que propose l'Empereur ?
L'Empereur suggčre
sa ničce Christina,
la duchesse de Milan.
Parlez-moi d'elle.
Originaire du Danemark,
elle fut mariée ŕ 13 ans
au duc de Milan, Francesco Sforza,
qui mourut un an plus tard.
Elle a maintenant 16 ans, est veuve
et apparemment toujours jeune fille.
Elle vit ŕ Bruxelles avec la régente,
Marie de Hongrie.
On la dit d'une grande beauté,
et elle se plaît ŕ chasser
et ŕ jouer aux cartes.
Chasser et jouer aux cartes.
Elle me plaît déjŕ.
Que notre ambassadeur aux Pays-Bas
se renseigne.
Majesté.
Notre ambassadeur
aux Pays-Bas, Sir John Hutton.
Ah, Sir John.
J'ai
une affaire urgente ŕ vous confier.
My Lord, M. Islick m'a prévenu.
Faites une liste de candidates pouvant
partager le lit de Sa Majesté.
My Lord,
j'ai peu d'expérience
avec les dames.
Cette mission m'est donc difficile.
Vous irez ŕ Bruxelles.
Vous vous renseignerez lŕ-bas sur
Christina, la duchesse de Milan.
Mais, aprčs cela,
allez au duché de Clčves,
renseignez-vous sur
les deux soeurs du Duc : Amélia et Anne.
Je désire
qu'on les prenne en compte.
Oui, Lord Cromwell.
Je veux voir mon fils.
Qu'avez-vous fait de mon fils ?
Oů est-il ?
Il est indemne.
Il le restera jusqu'ŕ que nous soyons
sűrs que vous n'avez pas trahi
comme votre frčre, Reginald.
Vous savez trčs bien
que ma famille a renié Reginald.
Ni ma mčre, ni moi ne soutenons
ou tolérons ce qu'il a fait.
Nous faisons publiquement allégeance
ŕ Sa Gracieuse Majesté.
"J'apprécie les procédés
de mon frčre,
"le Cardinal,
"mais je n'aime pas les actions
de ce royaume
"et je souhaite voir un changement
dans ce monde.
"Je nous voudrais tous deux
sur le continent.
"Le monde en Angleterre
a été perverti.
"La Loi de Dieu y a été renversée,
"les abbayes
et les églises ravagées."
Qui vous a donné cette lettre ?
Vous niez l'avoir écrite ?
Il y a un <i>post scriptum</i>.
"Le Roi mourra un jour,
soudainement.
"Sa jambe le tuera,
"et ça nous fera
un changement réjouissant."
Vos déclarations de loyauté
n'étaient que du vent,
Lord Montague.
Vous ętes, aprčs tout,
les cousins du Roi.
Les derniers des Plantagenęt.
Les derniers de la Rose blanche.
On dit que vous autres Pole
ętes les héritiers légitimes,
et que vous porterez un jour
la couronne. N'est-ce pas ?
Sir Francis.
Majesté.
Maintenant que nous avons
des preuves contre Henry Pole,
il nous faut incriminer la dame.
Des hommes aussi malhonnętes
et perfides
ont-ils une mčre honnęte ?
Qui est-ce ?
La veuve du comte d'Edgemont.
Une veuve ?
Attendez. C'est vrai
qu'elle n'en a pas l'air, mais
elle a plus de 40 ans.
D'un autre côté, il y a une jeune fille
ŕ la Cour,
elle n'a que 14 ans
mais a déjŕ belle tournure.
Laissez le fruit műrir
avant de le cueillir, Sir Francis.
- My Lord.
- Lord Cromwell.
- Majesté.
- Cromwell.
J'ai reçu une lettre
de Sir John Hutton,
l'ambassadeur ŕ Bruxelles.
Il s'est renseigné
au nom de Votre Majesté
sur la duchesse de Milan,
ničce de l'Empereur.
Que dit-il ?
Il écrit :
"la Duchesse n'a pas d'égales
"pour ce qui est de la beauté
ou de la naissance.
"Elle n'est pas aussi pure que
la derničre reine, mais
"quand elle sourit, des fossettes
se forment sur ses joues et son menton.
"Elles sont charmantes."
Parle-t-il d'autres dames ?
Seulement
d'une soeur du duc de Clčves : Anne.
- Il écrit...
- On m'en a parlé.
On dit que personne ne la loue
pour sa personnalité ou sa beauté.
Pardon, Majesté, mais
d'un autre côté, ce choix
pourrait avoir ses avantages.
Ce royaume a été
la proie des machinations
des Français et de l'Empereur,
mais Clčves est membre
de la ligue protestante,
qui triomphe en Europe,
et peut rivaliser avec nous.
Ainsi, enfin,
l'Angleterre pourrait
se forger son propre destin.
Pourtant,
je suis impatient d'en savoir plus
sur la duchesse.
Je veux ętre sűr qu'elle est aussi belle
que le dit Hutton.
Envoyez maître Holbein en faire
un croquis immédiatement.
- Majesté.
- Maître Cromwell.
Permettez-moi, Madame,
de vous demander
si vous épouseriez le roi.
Vous pouvez demander.
Vous savez que je suis aux ordres
de l'Empereur.
Madame, vous seriez si heureuse
d'avoir la chance
de plaire ŕ mon maître.
Vraiment ?
Pourquoi ?
Mon maître est le plus plaisant
des gentilshommes.
Il est si bienveillant, si agréable,
qu'ŕ ce jour, personne n'a entendu
d'injures sortir de sa bouche.
D'un autre côté, n'est-il pas étrange
que Sa Majesté ait,
en si peu de temps,
perdu trois reines ?
Je soupçonne que la premičre,
ma grand-tante, a été empoisonnée,
la seconde, mise ŕ mort sans raison,
et la troisičme est morte en couche
par manque de soins.
Franchement, Sir,
si j'avais deux tętes,
l'une serait
au service de Sa Majesté.
Hélas, je n'en ai qu'une.
Laissez-moi évoquer
les principales qualités de mon Maître.
- Elles vous séduiront.
- Non.
Ne perdez pas votre temps,
mes sentiments ne changeront pas.
Sauf si, bien sűr,
l'Empereur me l'ordonne.
Madame.
Sir Francis !
L'étendard des Plantagenęt.
Mon Dieu. Si je m'attendais ŕ ça !
Qu'est-ce ?
La banničre royale.
Et ceci,
le symbole le plus fort
de la rébellion.
Découverts dans votre maison.
Sir,
je suis une vieille femme.
Je n'ai rien fait
contre Sa Majesté le Roi.
Vous maintenez le contact
avec votre fils
malgré sa trahison.
Vous complotez avec lui.
Comment pouvez-vous supposer
qu'ŕ mon âge, je complote
contre quelqu'un ?
Je désire seulement vivre en paix,
loin du monde.
Le Roi pourrait-il faire preuve
de pitié et nous pardonner ?
Madame,
vous ętes tous suspectés
de haute trahison.
Les preuves sont contre vous.
Pour ce que vous méritez,
vous pouvez demander grâce,
mais rien ne peut la garantir.
Grand-mčre, oů ętes-vous ?
Grand-mčre !
La duchesse de Milan est ravissante.
Je suis vraiment enchanté.
Elle a l'air trčs belle, trčs...
pleine de vie.
Restez loin d'elle, Charles !
Aprčs notre mariage,
notre plus jeune fils sera anobli,
et fait Duc de York,
Gloucester et Somerset.
La Princesse Mary pourra épouser
Dom Luís.
C'est ce que vous voulez,
n'est-ce pas, Charles ?
Un mariage impérial.
Comme Wolsey
a toujours voulu une Française.
Tout le monde a des projets.
Et ce que je veux importe peu.
Les Pole, également.
On parle de ce garçon dans la tour,
et de la pauvre Lady Salisbury.
Je peux vous dire qu'ils ont du sang
Plantagenęt.
Mon pčre m'a dit...
Mon pčre m'a dit que
męme le plus petit arbuste
deviendra un jour un arbre !
Ce petit dans la tour
aura 40 000 hommes
derričre lui,
et vous serez l'idiot !
Faites venir le médecin.
Pour l'amour de Dieu, vite !
Charles !
Charles !
Des nouvelles du Roi ?
Avez-vous entendu ?
Est-il mieux ?
- Le Roi est mort.
- Le Roi n'est pas...
My Lord.
- Je dois voir le Roi.
- "dois"
Je dois voir votre neveu,
parfois, mais vous l'empęchez.
Le Roi est alité
depuis plus d'une semaine.
Sans nouvelles de lui,
il y a des rumeurs.
On le dit mort.
Cela vous conviendrait, n'est-ce pas ?
Votre neveu serait roi.
C'est un enfant !
Ça n'arrangerait personne.
Ni moi, ni vous, ni l'Angleterre.
Avec votre permission, Votre Grâce,
j'aimerais avoir l'opportunité
de réfuter ces rumeurs.
Trčs bien.
Au nom de Dieu, que... ?
Son ulcčre ŕ la jambe n'a pas éclaté
comme les autres fois.
Allez chercher le chirurgien,
qu'il perce ça.
Ça pourrait le tuer !
Comment va-t-il ?
Doublez la garde du prince.
Que personne ne l'approche.
Oui, My Lord.
Que Sir Francis emmčne
un détachement de la Garde ŕ Hunsdon.
Ils protégeront la princesse Mary
au péril de leur vie.
Si le Roi meurt, le garçon et elle
seront menacés.
Oui, Votre Grâce.
Oh, Seigneur !
Seigneur.
Que dois-je faire ?
M. Cromwell,
faites venir les chirurgiens.
J'en répondrai.
Oui, Votre Grâce.
Votre Majesté, pardonnez-moi.
Doucement.
Comment est-il ?
C'est le garçon le plus adorable
et le plus mignon.
Veillez sur lui.
- M. Cromwell.
- Majesté.
Avez-vous parlé
ŕ Castillon récemment ?
Oui, Majesté.
Qu'a-t-il dit
de Madame de Longueville ?
Elle a déjŕ épousé le roi d'Écosse.
Elle le regrettera quand elle verra
le temps qu'il fait lŕ-haut.
L'ambassadeur a évoqué
deux autres cousines
du roi François, pour votre Majesté.
Marie de Vendôme
et Anne de Varennes.
Marie de Vendôme a déclaré
vouloir se faire nonne,
mais Castillon pense
que ce n'est pas forcément un obstacle.
Si français !
J'ai besoin d'images ! Vous comprenez ?
J'ai besoin de les voir.
J'ai besoin de voir la femme
qui va ętre ma compagne pour la vie.
Oů en sont les négociations
avec la duchesse de Milan ?
Il y a un problčme de parenté.
En tant que ničce de l'Empereur,
la duchesse est la petite-ničce
de Catherine d'Aragon.
Autrefois, une dispense papale
aurait balayé cet obstacle.
Eh bien, il n'en est plus question !
En tant que chef de l'Église,
l'Empereur s'accordera
peut-ętre cette dispense.
Oui, Majesté !
Naturellement !
Je jouerai le jeu
de tomber amoureux encore.
Je croyais que votre mari
vous défendait de me voir ?
C'est vrai.
Mais ŕ présent il n'en a cure.
Il dit que ce n'est pas la peine
de vous tuer.
Moins j'en sais sur votre mari,
plus il me fascine.
C'est que je connais
les positions de chacun.
Comme Suffolk ou Cromwell.
Je connais leurs motivations,
męme s'ils essayent de les cacher.
Mais Edward.
Qui sait en quoi il croit vraiment ?
Voulez-vous que je vous le dise ?
Pour services rendus.
Vous n'ętes pas si bon
que vous le pensez.
C'était quand męme pas mal.
Dites-moi.
Il croit en lui-męme.
En son destin.
Edward est la clef
de son propre destin,
rien ne saurait l'arręter.
Un réformé ?
Vous pouvez répondre,
je le suis aussi.
Tout le monde sait
que je hais passionnément la papauté.
C'est pourquoi, parfois,
on m'appelle le Pape Noir.
Je viens juste d'ętre baisée
par le pape !
<i>In nomine Patris, et Fili</i>
<i>et Spiritus Sancti.</i>
Que pense-t-il de Cromwell ?
A-t-on découvert qui a tué
le député Robert Packington ?
<i>Non temebo malem.
Amen.</i>
My Lord Montague,
je suis ici pour vous accompagner
vers un monde meilleur.
Vous savez que je ne suis pas coupable,
enfoiré.
Seul mon frčre l'est,
mais vous ne pouvez l'atteindre,
donc vous devez tuer l'innocent.
Votre culpabilité ŕ été
maintes fois établie.
Il y avait des procédures
correctes, dans ce pays,
pour établir qui était coupable
et qui ne l'était pas.
Mais c'est fini, maintenant.
On a męme plus droit ŕ un procčs.
Alors,
comme il n'y a plus de justice,
il ne reste que la tyrannie.
Oů est ma mčre ?
Lady Salisbury est
ici, dans la Tour.
C'est une noble vieille femme
qui a toujours vécu
selon les préceptes de Dieu.
J'aurai une attention particuličre
pour elle,
corps et âme, My Lord.
Ayez confiance.
Vous savez, Monseigneur,
la vérité est que...
le Roi n'a jamais fait d'homme
qu'il n'ait détruit ensuite.
Alors faites attention.
Suivez-nous !
Certaines de ces Françaises me plaisent
plus que d'autres.
Mais puis-je me fier ŕ ces images ?
L'artiste n'a-t-il pas essayé
de flatter la dame ou de me plaire ?
Męme M. Holbein.
Comment me décider
sans les rencontrer
en chair et en os ?
Parlez ŕ Castillon.
Majesté.
Si Votre Majesté pouvait
choisir de considérer
le charme simple mais puissant
d'Anne de Clčves ou de sa soeur,
et les bénéfices
pour Vous et ce Royaume
d'une nouvelle union
avec la Ligue Protestante.
- Son Éminence, l'évęque de Winchester.
- Monseigneur l'évęque.
Majesté.
Votre Majesté,
pardonnez-moi,
mais j'ai remarqué que
certains chrétiens évangéliques
pręchent toujours
contre les Six Articles de Foi
et contre les ordonnances
de Votre Majesté.
Monsieur John Lambert
en fait partie.
Il pręche chaque semaine ŕ Londres
devant une foule de fidčles.
M. Lambert nie
la réalité de la présence de Dieu
dans le Sacrement de la Communion.
Il affirme qu'il s'agit plutôt
d'une commémoration symbolique
de la Passion du Christ.
Il sera condamné
par les mots du Christ
qui a dit : "Ceci est mon corps".
Il abjurera, ou sera brűlé.
Je ne protégerai aucun hérétique.
Il y a plus ?
Peut-ętre
ne devrais-je pas m'en męler,
Votre Majesté, mais on m'a dit que
Lord Cromwell connaît bien
M. Lambert.
Il paraît qu'ils ont étudié
ensemble ŕ Cambridge
et, il y a six mois,
quand Lambert fut appréhendé,
soupçonné d'avoir encouragé
les hérésies religieuses,
Lord Cromwell a fait annuler
les charges contre lui.
Merci, Monseigneur l'évęque.
Y a-t-il des nouvelles du mariage
du Roi avec la duchesse de Milan ?
Hélas, princesse, je pense
qu'il est compromis.
La duchesse est la petite-ničce
de votre mčre,
donc les liens sont trop proches.
Aussi, je pense que la dame
ne veut pas épouser le Roi.
Alors...
Je n'épouserai pas Dom Luis ?
On dit que le roi épousera
une Française
et vous,
un des fils du Roi français.
Ça ne vous satisferait pas,
je suppose.
Tout ce qui vous rendrait heureuse
me satisferait.
J'ai peur de n'ętre pas faite
pour le bonheur, Excellence.
Il paraît que Lady Salisbury
est emprisonnée dans la Tour
et que son fils a été exécuté.
C'est la vérité.
Son petit-fils est, lui aussi,
gardé prisonnier.
Je suis sűre
que c'est l'oeuvre de Cromwell.
Je ne devrais pas dire ça,
Excellence, mais ŕ vous...
de la męme façon que je crois
qu'il est le messager de Satan,
je jure qu'il a infecté
l'esprit du Roi !
Si je le pouvais,
je l'arracherais ŕ l'entourage
du Roi
et le brűlerais.
Son Excellence,
l'ambassadeur de France.
- Monsieur Castillon.
- Majesté.
Nous avons examiné
toutes ces candidates.
- Elles sont si nombreuses !
- Un véritable nid d'honnętes Dames.
En effet.
C'est justement le problčme.
Elles sont si nombreuses
ŕ ętre attirantes,
comment les aborder
individuellement ?
Donc...
peut-ętre le Roi Francis pourrait-il
en rassembler sept ou huit ŕ Calais.
Je pourrais m'y rendre
et les rencontrer toutes ŕ la fois.
Non. Ce n'est pas
dans les coutumes françaises d'envoyer
des dames de ce rang,
de familles princičres aussi nobles,
pour ętre passées en revue
comme des chevaux de concours.
Si Votre Majesté désire
une de ces dames,
elle pourrait envoyer quelqu'un
qui la renseignerait sur ses maničres,
son apparence.
Je n'ai confiance qu'en moi-męme.
La chose m'est trop précieuse.
Je veux les voir et les connaître
avant de choisir.
Peut-ętre que Votre Majesté aimerait
les monter, l'une aprčs l'autre,
pour ensuite choisir celle
qu'elle trouve la plus habile ?
Monsieur Castillon,
vous avez dix secondes pour partir,
ou je vous battrai comme un chien.
- M. Cromwell.
- Majesté.
Un hérétique récidiviste
du nom de John Lambert
est emprisonné dans la Tour
et y sera bientôt brűlé.
Il me semble que vous le connaissez.
Je le connaissais
il y a plusieurs années, ŕ Cambridge.
Pas depuis ?
Pas ŕ ma connaissance,
Votre Majesté.
Et lorsque vous étiez ensemble
ŕ Cambridge,
partagiez-vous certaines
de ses opinions ?
Dites-moi, M. Cromwell,
en quoi croyez-vous maintenant ?
Présentement, Votre Majesté,
je crois ce que vous croyez.
Donc vous pensez qu'il est juste
qu'il soit brűlé ?
Oui, ŕ moins qu'il n'abjure.
Oui.
Oh, j'oubliais !
- Comment s'appellent-elles, déjŕ ?
- Majesté ?
Les soeurs du Duc de Clčves.
Amelia et Anne.
Amelia et Anne.
Envoyez-leur quelqu'un.
Pour se faire un deuxičme avis.
Majesté.
Le Duc William va vous recevoir.
Votre Altesse,
les émissaires anglais.
- Messieurs.
- Votre Altesse.
Donc...
Sa Majesté le Roi Henry
est bien vivant,
et mes soeurs l'intéressent.
Oui. Sa Majesté est convaincue
de leur bonté et de l'opportunité
d'une union avec l'une d'elles.
Surtout Anne, l'aînée,
au sujet de laquelle le Roi a entendu
tant d'éloges.
Ça ne m'étonne pas.
Sa Majesté songerait aussi
au mariage de sa fille Mary
avec votre fils aîné,
ŕ un contact avec la Ligue Protestante,
et au recrutement d'une centaine
de canonniers expérimentés
pour son armée.
Il y a lŕ sujet ŕ discussion,
Messieurs.
En effet,
mais d'abord, nous sollicitons
la permission de rencontrer vos soeurs.
Pourquoi ?
Le Roi veut que nous lui rapportions
nos impressions.
Si nous ne pouvons voir
ces demoiselles,
il sera trčs contrarié.
Il souhaite également
qu'un portrait d'Anne
lui soit envoyé.
Malheureusement, notre peintre,
M. Cranack,
est malade
et indisposé.
Dans ce cas, nous vous ferons envoyer
M. Holbein,
qui est un excellent artiste.
En effet.
Oui, peut-ętre.
Mais vous allez trop vite.
Pour quoi prenez-vous mon pays ?
Un étal de boucher ?
Je vais charger mon chancelier
d'entamer les négociations.
Et vous pourriez,
ŕ un certain stade,
ętre présentés ŕ mes soeurs.
Votre Altesse, nous,...
Nous nous reverrons
plus tard.
Bonne journée, Messieurs.
John.
Thomas,
comme il est bon de vous voir,
et comme vous avez superbement
réussi dans le monde !
J'aurais préféré que nos retrouvailles
aient lieu ailleurs.
Je finirai bien
par quitter cet endroit
pour un monde meilleur.
Vous n'ętes pas obligé de mourir.
Pour plaire au Roi,
il vous suffit de dire
qu'aprčs la Consécration,
l'hostie et le vin sont
vraiment le corps et le sang du Christ.
Vous savez que c'est faux.
Vous n'avez pas ŕ le croire,
vous devez juste le dire.
Je sais maintenant ce qu'un homme doit
faire pour survivre en ce monde.
Il se doit
de pratiquer l'hypocrisie.
La discrétion ne fait pas de tort.
Et, croyez-moi, je veux vous éviter
les atroces souffrances
qui vous sont destinées.
Le Christ n'a-t-il pas lui aussi
affreusement souffert ?
Nous n'avons pas besoin de martyrs,
il nous faut des hommes vivants
pour augmenter discrčtement
l'étendue de notre Réforme.
Qui me croira
si je change d'avis sur une chose
aussi importante ?
John, je vous le demande ŕ nouveau
tant que vous avez encore le choix :
voulez-vous vivre ou mourir ?
Mon cher Lord Cromwell,
tout ce temps, nous ne parlions
pas de moi mais de vous.
Pas de ma pauvre conscience
mais de la vôtre.
Vous avez peur d'ętre déclaré
coupable de complicité
et préféreriez
que je purifie ma propre âme.
Hélas...
c'est la seule chose qu'il me reste.
Je suis désolé que vous choisissiez
votre perte.
Reviens fripouille !
Reviens, au nom du Roi !
Je prie pour toi !
Pour le Christ !
Pour le Christ !
Majesté.
M. Lambert a été conduit au bűcher.
Et en Enfer !
La Princesse Mary vous implore
d'épargner Lady Salisbury
qui a été comme une mčre pour elle.
Elle est aussi la mčre
de Reginald Pole
ŕ qui męme le paradis
ne peut pardonner.
Le Duc William vous fait dire que...
son peintre est souffrant. Il ne pourra
fournir de portrait de sa soeur Anne.
Envoyez Holbein.
Je dois la voir.
Majesté.
M. Cromwell.
Messieurs.
Je vous donne l'autorisation
de regarder mes soeurs.
Votre Altesse.
On ne sait laquelle est Anne
et laquelle est Amélia.
Je suis Anne.
Et moi, Amélia.
Votre Altesse,
étant donné notre objectif,
ce n'est pas bon.
Pas bon ? Quoi ?
Vous voulez les voir nues ?
Vous ne priez pas, Lady ?
Vous allez ętre décapitée.
Je ne veux pas mourir.
Je ne veux pas mourir.
Ne me touchez pas.
Non, ne me faites pas de mal.
Je ne veux pas mourir.
Non, non, ne me tuez pas.
Mon Dieu, sauvez-moi !
Aidez-moi !
Pour l'amour de Dieu, restez digne.
Je ne veux pas mourir.
- Éminence.
- Mon enfant.
Mon pauvre enfant.
Il les a tués.
Mon frčre, ma pauvre mčre.
Le Roi d'Angleterre est
le plus cruel des tyrans.
Il n'y a plus aucun doute,
il doit ętre renversé par la force.
Il vaut mieux qu'il meure,
plutôt que de risquer la damnation
éternelle de tous ses sujets.
Nous ne pouvons rien faire.
Si, nous pouvons.
Sa Sainteté est pręte ŕ promulguer
une bulle d'or pontificale.
L'Empereur et la France
ont fait la paix.
Ils s'apprętent ŕ attaquer
l'Angleterre.
Ils vont rappeler leurs ambassadeurs
et préparer une flotte pour l'invasion.
Sa Sainteté s'attend ŕ ce que vous
vous rendiez aux Pays-Bas
et en France
pour assister aux préparatifs.
Non, s'il vous plaît.
Laissez-moi aider autrement.
Quoi ?
Ętes-vous effrayé ?
Vous devez remercier Dieu d'avoir
rappelé votre famille au Paradis.
Vous ne devez pas pleurer.
Qu'est-ce que la foi
si vous ne vous fiez pas
ŕ la volonté de Dieu ?
Croyez-vous que le Pape veut que
vous alliez aux Pays-Bas
dans son intéręt ?
Ne croyez-vous pas qu'il suit
la voie de Dieu ?
Pardonnez-moi.
Qua... quan...
Quand j'étais un jeune prętre,
en Allemagne,
ma maison a été occupée
par des mercenaires luthériens.
J'avais une magnifique soeur,
que j'aimais
plus que tout au monde,
peut-ętre męme plus que Dieu.
Eh bien, ils l'ont violée,
ont mutilé sa poitrine
et jeté les morceaux aux chiens
juste devant mes yeux.
Nous avons
tous un fardeau ŕ porter,
Cardinal Pole.
Venez donc, Maître Paul.
Vous voilŕ, Cardinal Pole.
Maintenant,
mangez votre coeur.
Leave us!
Charles, please, sit.
The factions and the fighting
that went on inside this Court
while I mourned were unacceptable.
I'm appointing you President of the
Council and Lord Great Master,
so, in my absence,
all will be answerable to you.
Not Cromwell.
Majesty.
I'm also appointing Edward Seymour, to
investigate the activities of the Poles.
From now on, they're
all under suspicion.
How's your family?
They're well,
except...
my wife lost the child
she was carrying.
Then we have both lost something.
Sometimes I think I shall go mad.
My leg is poisoned and hurts again,
I'm afraid that my son will die
of The Plague, and I cannot sleep.
Majesty...
I know what it is that
we have both lost.
We've lost our youth.
There is nothing in the world,
that can ever return it to us.
"Beneditione tuam Domine,
"populos Fideles accipiat."
- "Per Christum Dominum nostrum."
- "Amen!"
Lady Salisbury!
You're hungry!
Eat!
- Stop, sir!
- Stand aside,
I'm on the King's business!
- What's that?
- I don't know.
Lady Salisbury,
forgive this intrusion,
but you and these members
of your family are arrested,
By the King's orders,
on suspicion of treason.
You will all have to come
straight with me.
Not my grandson, surely.
All.
I wanted to talk to you in private,
Monsieur l'Ambassadeur,
because I'm inclined
towards a French bride.
Although my advisors think I should
rather seek an Imperial match.
Ah, I admire your Majesty's taste,
and deplore that of your advisers.
Perhaps they are not men
of the world, as we are?
My Lord of the Privy Seal spoke
to me of two potential French brides:
Maria, the King's daughter,
and Marie de Guise,
Madame de Longueville.
Since I have heard further
of Madame de Longueville,
I cannot refrain from
considering her as a wife.
Good nose.
Peachy!
Cat's piss.
Not too sweet.
What have you heard?
The King's daughter's too young for me.
But Madame de Longueville
is more suitable,
being herself a widow, and
having already born two sons,
and being, as they say, very...
voluptuous.
My master told me that He
would think it a great honour,
if your Majesty were to take
a French girl as your new wife.
There is no Lady who
is not at His command,
except Madame de Longueville,
Whose marriage to the King of
Scotland,
has already been arranged.
This arrangement can be broken.
Tell your Master that I can do
twice as much for Him
as my nephew, the idiotic
and beggarly Scotish King.
Yes.
Yes, but so, in effect,
then, you would be marrying
another man's wife.
I will marry who I like!
Monsieur Castillon,
I have received offers
from every quarter.
Forgive me,
but His Majesty proposes
a double marriage.
His 19 year old son, Henri,
to your daughter, Mary,
and one of Madame Longeville's
sisters to you.
There are two of them:
Louise and Renné.
The former, remarkably
for the French Court,
is a rumoured to be still a virgin.
Wonderful!
Take Her.
Take Louise.
Since she is still a maid,
you will have the advantage of...
shaping the passage to your measure.
I wanna see my father!
Go get my father!
I want my father NOW!!
You know who I am?
Don't you?
Oh, yes! I know who you are.
You're Master Pole.
{\They say that }Some day you're gonna be
the King of England.
Let go of me!
Let go!
We must discuss marriage.
As usual, the French
want to mess Me around.
Who does the Emperor propose?
Your Majesty, the Emperor has
put forward Christina, His niece,
the Duchess of Milan.
Tell me about Her.
Originally from Denmark,
she was married at 13 to the
Duke of Milan, Francesco Sforza,
who died a year later.
She is now 16, both a widow,
and, apparently, still a maid.
She's living in Brussels,
with the Regent, Mary of Hungary.
She's reported to be a great beauty,
and likes nothing better than
hunting and playing cards.
Hunting and playing cards.
I like Her already.
Have Our Ambassador in the Netherlands
find out more about her.
Majesty.
{\My Lord, }Our Ambassador to the
Netherlands, Sir John Hutton.
Ah, Sir John...
I...
have some most urgent
business for you to do.
My Lord, Mr. Islick has warned me.
You are to make a list of potential
candidates to share His Majesty's bed.
My Lord,
I have not much
experience among ladies,
there fore, this commission
to me is hard.
You're to go to Brussels.
You're to make {\particular }inquiries there about
Christina, Duchess of Milan, but...
while you're about it,
go on to the Duchy of Cleves,
make enquiries there about the
Duke's two sisters: Amelia and Anne.
I'm anxious that they
should enter the reckoning.
Yes, my Lord Cromwell.
I wanna see my son.
What have you done with my son?
Where is he?
Your son is unharmed.
He will remain unharmed until we are
sure that you are not all traitors,
like your brother, Reginald.
You know very well that my
family has disowned Reginald.
Neither my mother nor I support or
condones what he has done.
We'll openly profess our
allegiance to His Gracious Majesty.
I like well the precedings of
my brother,
the Cardinal,
but I like not the doings
of this Realm,
and I trust to see
a change in this world.
I would wish that we
were both over the sea.
The world in England
waxes all crooked.
The God's Law has been
turned upside-down,
abbeys and churches overthrown.
Who gave you that letter?
Do you deny writing it?
It has a postscript:
"The King will die
one day, suddenly."
"His leg will kill Him,"
"and we will have a jolly...
stirring!"
Your professions of loyalty were
all hollow,
my Lord Montague.
You are, after all,
the King's cousins.
The last of the Plantagenets.
The last of the White Rose.
Some say you Poles,
are the rightfull heirs,
and will someday wear the garland.
Don't they.
Sir Francis.
Majesty.
Now that we found evidence against
Henry Pole, Lord Montague,
we need something against the Lady.
I ask you, whether such dishonest
and treacherous sons
could ever have had
an honest mother!
Who is that?
She's the widow of the
Earl of Edgemont.
A widow?
Wait. It's true she
doesn't look it, but...
she's over 40.
On the other hand,
there is a maid at Court,
she's only 14, but she already
has a goodly stature.
Let the fruit ripen before
you pluck it, Sir Francis.
- My Lord.
- My Lord Cromwell.
- Majesty.
- Cromwell.
I've just received a
letter from Sir John Hutton,
The ambassador in Brussels.
He's been making enquiries
on your Majesty's behalf
about the Duchess of Milan,
the Emperor's niece.
What does he say?
He writes,
"There's none in these parts"
"for beauty of person and birth
to compare with the Duchess."
"She's not so pure white as the
last Queen (God pardon), but"
"when she smiles there appear 2 dimples
in Her cheeks and one in Her chin."
"And we're very well."
Has He mentioned other Ladies?
Only a...
sister of the Duke of Cleves: Anne.
- He writes.
- I've heard about Her.
They say she's of no great praise,
either of Her personage or Her beauty.
Forgive me, Majesty, but...
on the other hand, such a match
could have its advantages.
This Realm has long been at
the mercy of the machinations
of the French or of the Emperor,
but Cleves is a member of
The Protestant League,
which daily grows in power
across Europe,
and could easily, rival with us.
Thus, at last,
could England
make its own destiny.
Even so,
I'm anxious to see
more about the Duchess of Milan.
I want to be sure she is
as beautiful as Hutton claims.
Send Master Holbein to do
a sketch of her by next tide.
- Majesty.
- Master Cromwell.
With your permission, Madam,
may I ask if you would consider
marrying the King?
You may ask, Sir.
And as for my inclination, you know
I am at the Emperor's command.
Madam, how happy you shall be
if it be your chance to be
matched with my Master.
Shall I?
Why?
My Royal Master is the most
gentle gentleman that lives.
His nature is so benign
and pleasant, that
'til this day, I think no man
has heard many,
if any angry words pass His mouth.
On the other hand, it is not strange
that the King's Majesty was
in so little space, rid
of His 3 Queens?
And I suspect, that the first,
my great aunt, was poisoned,
the second, innocently put to death,
and the third lost for lack
of care in Her child-bed.
Frankly, Sir, if I had two heads,
then one would be at
his Majesty's service.
Alas, I only have this one.
Madam, let me plead my
Master's better qualities,
- and appeal to your heart.
- No!
You must not labour any further,
for I shall not fix
my heart that way.
Unless, of course,
the Emperor commands me to.
Madam.
Sir Francis!
The Royal Banner
of the Plantagenets.
My God, what expectation is there!
What's this?
The Royal Banner.
And this...
The most potent symbol of rebellion.
Discovered in your house.
Sir,
I am an old Lady.
I have done nothing wrong or
against the King's Majesty.
You still communicate with
your son, Reginald Pole!
Despite him being a traitor.
No doubt you plot new
treacheries with him.
How can you suposse that at my age,
I am capable of plotting anything
against anyone?
I wish only to live a quiet life,
away from this world.
If the King in His mercy could
show pity and forgive us.
Madam,
you have all been attainted for
High Treason against His Majesty.
The evidence is great against you.
For what you deserve,
you may well beg mercy,
but whom shall say if
it be granted or not.
Grandmother,
where are you?
Grandmother!
The Duchess of Milan is enchanting.
I am singularly pleased.
This picture makes Her
look very pretty, very...
full of life.
Keep your hands off her, Charles!
After our wedding,
our younger sons will be enobled
with the ancient Dukedoms of York,
Gloucester and Somerset,
and Princess Mary can marry
Dom Luís.
That's what you want,
isn't it, Charles?
An Imperial wedding.
Just as Wolsey always wanted
a french one.
Everyone has an agenda!
And what I want doesn't matter!
The Poles have an agenda.
People talk about that poor little boy
in The Tower,
and poor old Lady Salisbury.
But let me tell you, they have
Plantagenet blood in their veins!
And my father told me,
My father told me that if you leave
even a sappling in the ground,
one day it will grow into a tree!
And that little boy in The Tower
will have 40,000 troops
flocking to his banner,
and you will be the sucker!
Fetch the king's physician.
God's sake, man, run!
Charles!
Charles!
My Lord, what news of the king?
Have you heard?
Is he recovered?
- The king is dead.
- The king's not...
My Lord.
- I must see the king.
- "Must"
I may see your nephew, the Prince,
sometimes, but you prevent it.
The king has lain ill
for over a week.
There has been no news about him.
So, there are rumors.
Some say the king is dead.
That would suit you, wouldn't it?
Since your nephew would be King.
He is a child!
That would be to no-one's use.
Not to mine, not to yours,
and not to England's.
With your permission, Your Grace,
I would like the opportunity
to disprove those rumours.
Very well.
What in the name of God?
This time, the ulce
in his leg has failed to burst,
as it has always done before.
Then fetch the barber-surgeons
to lance it.
That might kill him!
How is His Majesty?
Double the guards around the prince.
No-one is to be allowed
access to him.
Yes, m'Lord.
Tell Sir Francis to take a
detachment of the Guard to Hunsdon,
so he and they may keep watch over
the Princess Mary with their lives.
For, if the ring dies, some will be
for the boy, others for her.
Yes, Your Grace.
Oh, Lord!
Lord.
What shall I do?
Mr. Cromwell,
I bid you call for the surgeon-barbers.
I will answer for it.
Yes, Your Grace.
Your Majesty, forgive me.
Soft, now.
How is the child?
It is the sweetest, prettiest
boy that ever lived.
Keep him safe.
- Mr. Cromwell...
- Majesty.
Have you spoken
to Castillon recently?
Yes, Majesty.
What he said about
Madame de Longueville?
She has already got married...
to the king of Scotland.
She'll regret it...
when she sees what the
weather's like up there.
The ambassador mentioned
there are two other cousins
of King Francis, potentially
available to your Majesty.
Marie de Vendome
and Anne of Varennes.
Apparently,
Marie de Vendome has already
announced her intention
to become a nun,
although Castillon thought that
not necessarily an obstacle.
How very french!
I need pictures! Do you understand?
I need to see them.
I need to see the woman
who's gonna be my companion for life.
What of the negotiations
with the duchess of Milan?
There is the problem of affinity.
As niece of the emperor,
the duchess is,
therefore, great-niece
to Catherine of Aragon.
In the past, such obstacles might have
been overcome by Papal dispensation...
Well, there's no question
of that now!
But, perhaps,
as head of the church of England,
the emperor will allow me...
to make a dispensation.
Yes, Majesty!
Naturally!
It'll take a good sport to
make me feel amorous again.
I thought your husband warned
you to stay away from me?
Oh, he did...
but now he doesn't care.
He said he couldn't be
bothered to kill you.
You know, the less I know about our
husband, the more he fascinates me.
See, I know, more or less,
where most people stand.
Like Suffolk, Cromwell...
I know their true beliefs,
even if they try to hide them.
But Edward... Who knows
what he truly believes.
Would you like me to tell you?
'For Services Rendered'!
You're not quite as good
as you think you are.
That'still pretty good.
Tell me.
He believes in himself.
In his destiny.
Prince Edward is the key
to his destiny,
nothing will stand in his way.
He's a reformer?
No, You can answer.
I am too. I swear.
Everyone knows
I hate popery with a passion.
That's why sometimes
they call me the black pope.
Hello! I've just been fucked
by the pope!
In Nomine Patris, et Fili
et Spiritis Sancti.
How does he think about Cromwell?
That, I don't know...
but...
Did anyone ever discover
who shot Robert Packington, M.P.?
non temebo malem.
Amen.
My Lord Montague,
I am here to help you...
to a better place.
You know I'm not guilty,
you bastard.
Only my brother is guilty,
but you can't touch him, can you,
so you have to kill the innocent.
Your guilt has been established
beyond question.
There used to be procedures here,
proper legal procedures
in this country
to establish who was
guilty and who was not.
But that's all gone, now.
You don't even have to have a trial.
So, since there is no judiciary,
what's left is only tyranny.
Where is my mother?
Lady Salisbury is...
here within The Tower.
Please have a care for her,
my Lord Bishop.
Whatever she might have done,
be it so offensive,
she is an old and true woman,
and has always lived
under the precepts of God.
I will have a...
tender care for her,
body and soul, my Lord.
Trust me.
You know, my Lord,
this the truth...
the King never made a man,
but he destroyed him again.
So take a care, my Lord.
Come along!
I like more the look of some of
these french girls more than the others.
But can the likeness be trusted?
Could the artist not use some licence
to either flatter the lady or please me?
Even Mr. Holbein.
How can I make a decision on them
when I haven't met them
in the flesh?
Talk to Castillion.
Majes...
If Your Majesty might still
choose to consider
the simple but profound charms of
Anne of Cleves, or of her sister,
and of the benefits
to you and this realm of a
new alignment with
The Protestant League.
- His Grace, the Bishop of Winchester.
- My Lord Bishop.
Majesty.
Your Majesty,
forgive me, but it has come
to my attention that
certain Evangelicals
are still preaching
against the Six Articles of Faith,
and Your Majesty's
religious agreement.
Mr. John Lambert is one such,
who preaches, once a week,
in London, to large audiences.
Mr. Lambert denies
the real presence of God
in the Sacrament of Communion.
Saying, rather, that it is merely
a symbolic commemoration
of the Passion of Christ.
Then Mr. Lambert will be condemned
in Christ's own words,
who said: "This is my body."
He will recant, or be burned.
I will not patron heretics.
Is there more?
Perhaps, it is none of my business,
Your Majesty, but I am told that
Mr. Lambert is well known
to my Lord Cromwell.
It appears that they were educated
together at Cambridge,
and some six months ago,
when Lambert was aprehended,
on suspicion of promoting
religious heresy,
my Lord Cromwell had
the charges dismissed.
Thank you, my Lord Bishop.
What news of the King's marriage
to the duchess of Milan?
Alas, princess, I think
it is not to happen.
The duchess is the great-niece
of your mother,
and so the affinity is too touch.
Also, I think the lady does not
want to marry the king
Then...
I shall not marry Dom Luis?
They say the king may now
marry a french lady,
and you,
one of the french king's sons.
Surely, that would not please you?
Anything would please me,
my Lady, which made you happy.
I'm afraid I was not born
for happiness, Excellency.
I hear Lady Salisbury is being kept
in The Tower,
and her son executed.
It is sadly so.
Her grandson, too,
is being kept a prisoner.
I am sure
it is all Cromwell's doing.
I should not say this to many people,
Excellency, but I say it to you...
as I agree with those who say
he is messenger of Satan.
I swear
he has poisoned the King's mind!
And if I could,
I would strip him
from the King's side,
and burn him.
His Excellency,
the french ambassador.
- Monsieur Castillion.
- Majesty.
We have been considering
all these candidates for our hand.
- There are so many!
- Indeed, a warren of honourable Ladies.
Quite...
but the fact is,
in the circumstances,
because
many of them appear attractive,
I do not see how I can
approach them individually.
So...
perhaps King Francis can assemble
seven or eight of them at Calais,
I could go there and make their
acquaintance, all at the same time.
No, it... it is not
a french custom to send
ladies of that rank, of such noble
and princely families to be
be passed in review,
as if they were prize horses.
Perhaps, if Your Majesty desires
one of these ladies,
You could send an envoy,
to report on their manner and
appearance, in the traditional way.
Well, I trust no one but myself.
The thing touches me too near.
I want to see and know
them before deciding.
Maybe Your Majesty would like
to mount them, one after another,
and then pick the one
you find "best broken-in"?
Monsieur Castillon,
You have ten seconds
to get out of my court,
or I will beat you like
the dog that you are!
- Mr. Cromwell.
- Majesty.
An incorrigible heretic
called John Lambert
is now imprisoned in The Tower
and likely soon to be burned.
I believe you know this man.
I... KNEW him, many
years ago, at Cambridge.
Not since?
Not to my knowledge, Your Majesty.
And whilst you were
at Cambridge, together,
did you share some of his opinions?
Tell me, Mr. Cromwell,
what do you believe NOW?
As the world stands, Your Majesty,
I believe what YOU believe.
So you think it right
that he SHOULD be burned?
Yes, unless he recants.
Yes.
Oh, I forgot!
- What were their names, again?
- Majesty?
The sisters of the Duke of Cleves.
Amelia and Anne.
Amelia and Anne.
Send someone to take a look at them.
We'll have a second opinion.
Majesty!
Duke William will receive you now.
Your Highness,
the english envoys.
- Gentlemen!
- Your Highness.
So...
His Majesty, King Henry, is alife,
and he is interested in my sisters.
Yes, His Majesty has
been persuaded of their...
aimiability and of their
suitability as royal consorts.
Especially Anne, the eldest,
who has been much praised
in the King's hearing.
I am not surprised.
His Majesty would also propose
the marriage of his daughter Mary
to your eldest son,
a liaison with the Protestant League,
and the recruitment of a hundred
seasoned cannoneers
for His army.
There is, then, gentlemen,
much to discuss.
Indeed...
but first, we should like your
permission to meet your sisters.
Why?
The King will expect us to report back
on what we have seen.
To say that we have
NOT seen the ladies...
would not exactly please him.
He has also asked
for a portrait of Anne
to be sent back to him.
Unfortunately, My Court painter,
Mr. Cranack,
is... ill...
and indisposed.
In that case, we can
send over Mr. Holbein,
who is an admirable artist.
- Indeed.
- Yes, perhaps...
but you are going too quickly!
What do you think my country is?
A meat market?
I will arrange with my chancellor
for negotiations to commence.
And you may have the opportunity,
at some stage,
of being presented to my sisters.
Your Highness, we...
We will meet... again.
Good day, gentlemen.
John!
Thomas! How good to see you,
and how excellently
you've done in the world.
I could wish our reunion
was in some better place.
I shall be quit of this place
soon enough.
On my way to a far better place.
John, you do not have to die.
All you have to say,
to satisfy the King,
is that after Consecration,
the wafer and the wine are truly
the body and the blood of Christ.
But you and I know they are not.
You don't have to believe it,
you just have to say it!
Ah, Thomas...
I see now what it takes for a man
to make his way in this world.
He must make a practice
of hypocrisy.
There is no harm in indiscretion.
And, believe me, I want to spare you
the awful pains
which have been prepared for you.
Did Christ, himself,
not suffer awful pains, Thomas?
We do not need martyrs,
we need living men,
who will go on about quietly spreading
the business of our reformation.
Who will believe a word I say,
if I alter my opinion on
such a fundamental thing?
John, I say to you, again,
while you still have a free choice,
will you live or die?
My dear Lord Cromwell,
I see that all this while, we have not
been talking about me but about you.
Not about my poor conscience,
but about yours.
I see that you are afraid
of guilt by association,
and would rather I
purged my own soul.
Alas...
it is the only thing
in this world I have left.
I am sorry you choose
not to save yourself.
<i>Get back, you rabble!</i>
<i>Get back, in the name of the King!</i>
<i>I'll pray for you!</i>
All for Christ!
<i>All for Christ!</i>
Majesty.
Mr. Lambert has gone
to his execution.
And to Hell!
Princess Mary begs you to spare
the life of Lady Salisbury,
Who, she says,
was like a mother to Her.
She was also a mother
to Reginald Pole,
whom even heaven can't forgive.
Duke William says that...
his painter is ill. He cannot
furnish images of his sister Anne.
Send Holbein.
I must see her image.
Majesty.
Mr. Cromwell.
Gentlemen!
You have my permission
to look upon my sisters.
Your Highness!
We cannot even tell which
is Anne and which Amelia!
Sirs, I am Anne.
And I am Amelia, Your Honours.
Your Highness,
for our purposes...
this is no good.
No good? What?
Would you see them naked?
Have you not been praying, Lady?
Your head is going
to be cut off now.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
No, please don't hurt me!
No. Don't. Don't. Don't hurt me.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die!
No! No, don't kill me! No!
Oh God, save me!
Oh God, help me!
For God's sake, have some dignity.
No, I don't want to die!
- Eminence!
- My child.
My poor child.
He's killed them.
My brother, my poor mother...
The King of England is the most
cruel and abominable tyrant!
Ah, there's no doubt, now,
he must be overthrown by force.
Better that he should die,
than risk the Eternal Damnation
of all his subjects!
But there's nothing we can do.
But we can!
His Holiness is ready to promulgate
the Bull of Excommunication.
The Emperor and the French
have made peace.
They are now both willing to
point their swords at England.
They will withdraw their ambassadors,
and prepare a fleet for invasion.
And, the Holy Father expects you
to return to The Netherlands
and to France,
- to assist the preparations.
- No.
No, please.
Let me help in other ways.
What? Do... tell me,
are you frightened?
Now, you should thank God that He
has called your family to Heaven.
You should not weep.
So, what is belief?
What is belief, if not
belief in the Will of God!
Do You think the Holy Father
wants you
to go to The Netherlands
for his own sake?
Don't you think He has asked
God for guidance?
Forgive me.
Whe... Whe...
When I was a young
priest in Germany,
my family's house was occupied
by Lutheran mercenaries.
I had a beautiful sister,
whom I loved
more than anything else
in the world and,
perhaps, even more than God.
Well, they raped her,
they cut off their breasts,
they threw pieces
of her to their dogs,
right in front of my eyes.
All of us...
have burdens to carry,
Cardinal Pole.
Come on now, Master Paul.
There you are, Cardinal Pole.
Now,
eat your heart!

- Maître Holbein.
- My Lord.
J'ai une mission à vous confier.
Le Duc de Clèves vous autorise
à peindre sa fille Anne.
Partez immédiatement.
Tant de choses se passent et vous avez
le temps de discuter d'une peinture ?
Ce n'est pas une toile ordinaire.
De grandes choses en dépendent.
D'ailleurs, quoi que vous trouviez
à cette dame,
quelle que soit son apparence,
il faut que votre art en renvoie
une image plaisante.
Même si elle est laide
comme un pou ?
J'espère
que ce n'est pas à ce point.
Vous souhaitez que je mente
si nécessaire ?
Évidemment.
L'art n'est que mensonge,
maître Holbein.
My Lords, depuis la signature
du Traité de Tolède
entre le Roi de France
et l'Empereur,
il y a des signes indéniables
qu'ils préparent une guerre
contre ce Royaume.
Vous savez combien le Vicaire de Rome
les y a encouragés.
À présent, on nous informe
du rassemblement
de flottes à Anvers et à Bologne
et d'une armée en Hollande.
En outre, les ambassadeurs
français et impériaux
ont été rappelés au pays.
My Lords,
nous avons réagi à ces provocations.
Les forces défensives sont en place,
ainsi que des balises
d'alerte sur la côte.
Nous avons lancé la construction
de forts d'artillerie
au bord de la Manche.
Au Nord, nous avons renforcé
nos frontières écossaises.
La flotte de guerre de Sa Majesté
a été approvisionnée.
Les navires étrangers ne peuvent
partir sans autorisation royale.
My Lords,
comment douter
que le Pape, cette idole malsaine,
cet ennemi de la vérité,
cet imposteur,
manigance pour corrompre
la religion anglicane
et la priver de sa fortune ?
My Lords, en un tel moment,
j'aime me trouver parmi mon peuple.
Je visiterai les lieux
où les barricades
et les protections du Royaume
ont été construites
pour encourager mes troupes
et intimider mes ennemis.
My Lords.
Votre Majesté.
Nous semblons menacés
de toutes parts, Sir Francis.
Écosse, Espagne, Pays-Bas.
Nous sommes piégés
comme des rats en cage.
Encore une chose.
D'après les agents de Cromwell,
il y a 2 semaines, le Cardinal Pole
a quitté Rome pour une mission secrète.
- Le poursuivons-nous encore ?
- Dès que nous saurons où il est,
nous le ferons.
Affutez vos lames.
Votre Grâce.
- Lord.
- Pourrions-nous parler
- en privé ?
- Un jour. Pas maintenant.
M. Holbein a envoyé ce portrait
d'Anne de Clèves,
Votre Majesté.
Elle est agréable.
Nos ambassadeurs
l'ont-ils bien vue ?
Sir John m'a écrit pour me faire
l'éloge de la princesse :
"Elle est incomparable
et éclipse la Duchesse de Milan
comme le soleil doré éclipse
la lune argentée."
Majesté,
puis-je ?
Le mariage avec la Duchesse de Milan
n'est plus envisageable
depuis que l'Empereur et les Français
sont ligués contre nous.
Ni avec une quelconque Française.
Votre Majesté est entourée
d'ennemis.
Le mariage avec Anne de Clèves
apportera le support financier
et militaire
de la Ligue Protestante.
Quoi ?
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Des navires ennemis
arborant l'aigle noir.
Regardez.
Je les vois !
Seigneur !
Allumez les balises.
Vite.
Allumez-les.
Que Dieu nous garde.
Duc William,
Sa Majesté est très attirée
par le portrait de votre soeur Anne.
Elle vous suggère d'envoyer
des ambassadeurs en Angleterre
pour conclure les négociations,
dont la question de la dot
de votre soeur, entre autres.
Encore une fois,
Sa Majesté va trop vite.
Mais, Votre Altesse,...
Le Roi devrait me rencontrer
publiquement,
et me supplier à genoux
pour obtenir la main de ma soeur
et la protection de la Ligue.
De toute façon,
Anne a déjà été promise
au fils du Duc de Lorraine.
Je ne vois pas comment rompre
cet engagement
- en préservant mon honneur.
- Votre Altesse,
si c'est vrai, il s'agit
de la plus inattendue
et désagréable des découvertes.
C'est parce que vous espérez
depuis le début les égards
de Clèves et de ma soeur.
Mais mon pays n'est pas un bordel,
ni ma soeur une pute.
Bien...
Si votre maître désire réellement
une alliance,
il doit montrer son respect
pour mon pays
et offrir un prix plus élevé
pour la virginité de ma soeur.
Faites place !
Merci.
Allez.
Un message pour Sa Majesté.
Majesté.
Il est de Sir Thomas Chaining,
Maître des Cinq Ports.
"Votre Majesté, Lords du Conseil,
"Ce matin, 68 vaisseaux de l'Empereur
flottaient sur la Manche.
"J'y ai envoyé deux bateaux.
Mes archers
"sont montés à bord
du navire principal
"où l'Amiral s'est montré courtois.
"Sa flotte est en route
pour l'Espagne,
"pas pour l'Angleterre
"et il ne nous veut aucun mal,
ni à nous, ni à nos côtes.
"Pour preuve de ces mots,
il suffit de voir
"ces navires aussi peu armés
"que ceux qui contenaient
"le ravitaillement pour
l'Empereur à Constantinople."
L'ambassadeur impérial,
Votre Majesté.
Je vous croyais rappelé.
Il y a eu des rumeurs,
Votre Majesté,
mais je n'avais aucune envie
de partir.
Non que je pense
que ce soit justifié.
Bien sûr.
Mais votre maître et le Roi de France
ont formé une alliance contre moi
et on dit qu'ils préparent une invasion
approuvée
par le Vicaire de Rome.
J'exerce cette fonction
depuis longtemps.
Je sais quand je dois croire
ce que j'entends,
et c'est rarement le cas.
Bien que l'Empereur ait donné l'accolade
au Roi de France
et lui ait remis
l'Ordre de la Toison d'Or,
il le déteste toujours.
Plus que tout autre ennemi,
mon maître craint les Turcs,
et les Français leur sont alliés.
Comment pardonner une telle attitude
de la part d'un roi chrétien ?
Il n'y a donc plus d'alliance ?
L'accord est déjà rompu.
La Duchesse de Milan est donc
à nouveau disponible
pour le lit de Sa Majesté.
C'est trop tard, M. Chapuys.
Dites-moi,
dois-je être soulagé
d'avoir été utilisé comme un pion
entre votre maître
et le Roi de France ?
Je vous le dis ici et maintenant :
j'en ai eu assez, M. Chapuys.
J'en ai eu assez.
Vous pouvez partir.
Je suis surpris de vous revoir
si tôt, Excellences.
Nous avons de bonnes nouvelles,
Votre Altesse.
Comment ça ?
Sa Majesté désire tant
épouser votre soeur Anne
qu'elle est prête à renoncer
à exiger une dot.
- Il ne veut rien ?
- Seulement sa nouvelle épouse.
Le plus rapidement possible.
Sa Majesté offrira également
à Votre Altesse
une généreuse somme d'argent
pour être présentée à la Ligue.
Cependant, nous vous rappelons
que votre soeur
est déjà promise
au fils du Duc de Lorraine.
Oui, c'était en effet
un obstacle important.
Néanmoins, suite à des recherches,
nous avons découvert que
le contrat n'a jamais été signé
et qu'il n'existe
aucun engagement légal.
Alors votre soeur est libre
d'épouser le Roi ?
J'enverrai mon ambassadeur en Angleterre
pour conclure les négociations.
Gentlemen.
Qu'est-ce ?
Des agents de Cromwell ont intercepté
une lettre du Cardinal Pole.
Il était en route pour Rome.
Je me suis occupé de la déchiffrer.
Puis-je la voir ?
"Au Cardinal Von Waldburg.
"J'étais censé me rendre à Paris
et y rencontrer le Roi.
"Je lui ai déjà écrit
"avoir trouvé l'Empereur bien disposé
à l'égard de ma mission,
"mais il l'appréhende.
"L'Empereur craint les Turcs
plus que le Roi Henry.
"Je pense donc
qu'il ne tentera rien contre lui.
"Mon voyage est reporté.
"Je me rendrai plutôt à la cité papale
de Carpentras
"où j'attendrai les consignes
de Sa Sainteté."
Êtes-vous déjà allé à Carpentras ?
Non...
mais j'ai très envie d'y aller.
Le Duc de Suffolk, My Lord.
Votre Grâce.
Que me vaut cet honneur ?
Je suis venu vous féliciter.
Le Roi vous a fait Comte de Hartford
et je crois
qu'il est temps d'oublier
nos disputes et difficultés passées.
Nous avons mieux à faire.
Je suis d'accord avec Votre Grâce.
- À boire ?
- S'il vous plaît.
Je vous en prie.
J'ai ordre de rencontrer la Princesse
à Calais.
Beaucoup de choses
dépendent de ce mariage, non ?
Le bonheur du Roi, déjà.
Et la réputation de Lord Cromwell.
Quel dommage
si les choses tournaient mal.
Je plaindrais le Roi.
Mais d'un autre côté ?
- Santé !
- Santé !
Alors il épouse une hérétique
luthérienne ?
- Apparemment.
- Et je n'épouserai personne ?
- My Lady... Je...
- Non, je préfère ça.
Pensez-vous que j'aimerais
être mariée au frère du Duc,
ou à un de ses cousins hérétiques ?
Je préfèrerais vivre
dans un monastère.
On ne sait plus quoi penser du Roi.
Il brûle un Lucifer
puis en épouse un autre ?
Si Dieu le veut,
qu'elle se noie en mer.
CHEQUERS, CALAIS
FRANCE OCCUPÉE PAR LES ANGLAIS
Messieurs,
nous vous souhaitons la bienvenue
à Calais sous ces bons auspices.
<i>Danke.</i>
Puis-je vous présenter Son Éminence,
le Duc de Suffolk ?
Votre Éminence, je suis honoré.
Je suis Herr Hoghesten,
et voici le comte Olisleger.
<i>Hallo !</i>
Et voici
Son Altesse la Princesse Anne.
Après si longtemps, mon Dieu !
Votre Altesse.
Bonjour, Votre Éminence.
Le mauvais temps risque de retarder
notre voyage de quelques jours.
Je comprends.
Peut-être Votre Grâce pourrait-elle
m'expliquer les habitudes
des Anglais à table ?
Bien sûr.
Et peut-être
me montrer certaines choses
que le Roi aime faire ?
Sa Majesté aime jouer aux cartes
et parier.
- Vous jouez ?
- Non.
Il me semble que seuls les hommes
jouent aux cartes dans mon pays.
Et parier, n'est-ce pas
une mauvaise chose ?
Seulement si on a pas les moyens.
Nous jouerons au piquet.
C'est assez simple.
<i>Das ist gut.</i>
Il y a quatre couleurs :
les piques, les trèfles,
les carreaux et les coeurs.
Des coeurs ?
Vous jouez avec les coeurs ?
Parfois.
Et ici, nous avons les as, les rois,
les reines et les valets.
Alors toute la Cour est présente,
<i>ja</i> ?
Le Roi gagne-t-il toujours ?
Sa Majesté n'aime pas perdre.
Que vous a-t-on dit
à propos du Roi ?
Pourquoi ?
Que devrais-je savoir ?
CARPENTRAS,
ENCLAVE PONTIFICALE DU COMTAT VENAISSIN.
- Vous êtes Francis Bryan ?
- Pouvez-vous nous mener au Cardinal ?
<i>Si.</i> Oui. Venez vite.
Il est avec nous.
Où est ce bâtard ?
Désolé, <i>signor</i>.
<i>Prego</i>.
Dieu vous garde, mes enfants.
Nous ne l'aurons jamais.
C'est une perte de temps.
Peut-être pas.
Sainte Marie, priez pour nous
et délivrez-moi de mes ennemis.
<i>Amen.</i>
- Avez-vous vu son visage ?
- Non,
mais elle joue aux cartes
aussi agréablement
et avec autant de grâce
que toute aristocrate.
Elle est venue à Rochester.
Je dois la rencontrer
dans trois jours.
Je suis plus impatient que jamais
de la voir.
Et Sir Francis Bryan ?
Lui et Sir Thomas Seymour
sont à Carpentras
où le Cardinal Pole est censé
se cacher.
On dit qu'il redoute
d'être assassiné.
Il a bien raison.
Cet homme devrait être immolé vivant
et sa peau me servir de chemise.
Il maudira le jour où il a autorisé
le Pape à m'utiliser et à me menacer.
Je ne peux plus tolérer
cette attente.
Cela fait trop longtemps.
Je dois nourrir mon amour.
- Je comprends.
- Vraiment ?
Je veux posséder cette femme
et je ne l'ai pas encore vue.
C'est une étrangère pour moi.
Et si je ne peux pas ?
Si vous ne pouvez pas... quoi ?
Bander.
- Majesté.
- Amenez-moi le palefrenier.
Je pars pour Rochester à l'instant.
Allez !
Faites place !
Descendez !
Prévenez la dame qu'un gentilhomme vient
la voir avec un présent de Nouvel An.
Je vous souhaite la bienvenue
en mon Royaume.
J'espère
que vous serez à l'aise ici,
avant votre voyage à Londres.
Merci, Votre Majesté.
Je vous verrai à Londres.
J'aurais dû prendre
plus de leçons avec le Duc.
Les manières anglaises diffèrent
beaucoup des nôtres.
Je ne l'aime pas !
Me comprenez-vous ?
Je ne l'aime pas !
Réunissez le Conseil.
Dans le mariage, les princes
souffrent plus que les pauvres,
car ils doivent accepter
ce qu'on leur impose,
alors que les pauvres
sont libres de choisir.
Anne de Clèves me déçoit.
Elle ne correspond pas
à sa réputation. Pas du tout !
Elle ressemble à un cheval.
Une jument sans poils !
Votre Majesté se souvient
que c'est Sir John
qui la décrivait comme...
Je ne l'ai jamais bien vue,
ce n'est pas ma faute.
J'ai accompli ma mission au mieux,
et vous saviez que j'étais mauvais juge
en matière de femmes.
My Lord Cromwell,
niez-vous m'avoir vanté sa beauté ?
L'opportunité de notre mariage ?
Non, Votre Majesté.
Si j'ai trompé Votre Majesté
et son Conseil
à cause d'informations erronées,
j'en suis désolé.
Si j'avais su,
elle ne serait jamais venue ici !
Quels recours avons-nous ?
Votre Majesté, il n'y en a aucun.
Vous vous pliez aux exigences de Clèves
depuis le début.
Continuez.
Aujourd'hui, l'Empereur est
l'invité du roi de France.
Ils ont renouvelé leur alliance.
Si nous offensons les Allemands,
l'Angleterre restera seule
et sans alliés, à la merci du Roi
et de l'Empereur.
Si vous rompez ce contrat de mariage
maintenant,
vous risquez que le Duc William
lui-même
veuille se venger.
Je regrette que Votre Majesté
soit déçue.
Je suis mal conseillé, M. Cromwell.
Majesté.
Milady.
Je vous souhaite la bienvenue
en votre demeure.
Votre Majesté est très aimable
et je suis très heureuse.
Mes filles, la princesse Mary
et la princesse Elizabeth.
Pour vous...
Je les trouve jolies.
Merci, Princesse.
Je vous trouve jolie aussi.
Je les aimerai toutes les deux.
Je ne l'aime pas.
Mais Votre Majesté doit l'épouser.
Qui dit ça ? Cromwell ?
Mes avocats y travaillent.
La fiancée peut être écartée
pour deux raisons :
soit les émissaires ne disposent pas
des pouvoirs
pour conclure les négociations
en vue du mariage,
soit ils ne peuvent prouver
que son fiancé a été révoqué.
Je m'en sortirai dans les deux cas.
Je le souhaite de tout mon coeur
à Votre Majesté.
Je trouve que Lord Cromwell
insiste trop sur l'absence de recours.
Le mariage était son idée.
Il y avait d'autres candidates.
La Duchesse de Milan est la femme
la plus désirable au monde.
Au lieu de ça...
Peut-être, dans cette affaire,
Cromwell s'est-il surestimé.
Peut-être.
Oh Dieu !
S'il n'y a pas de recours,
je vais devoir m'y résoudre.
Je suis désolé,
je ne vous avais pas vu, je...
Je parlais à Dieu.
Vous devez aller à l'église,
pour ça.
Ne comprends-tu rien à la Réforme ?
Dieu n'est pas seulement à l'église,
Il est... partout.
L'entremise des prêtres est inutile.
Nous pouvons Lui parler nous-mêmes,
et Il nous écoutera.
Il n'y a pas besoin de cloches,
de livres et de cierges.
Tu as juste besoin de ton âme.
Va, maintenant. Penses-y.
Attends !
Aujourd'hui,
nous célébrons l'Épiphanie
et mon mariage.
N'y a-t-il vraiment aucun recours ?
Nous n'en avons découvert aucun,
Votre Majesté.
Je suis mal entouré.
Quand Votre Majesté connaîtra
mieux la dame...
Je ne veux pas mieux la connaître,
M. Cromwell !
Rien que l'idée me révulse.
Si ce n'était pour satisfaire
le monde et mon Royaume,
rien ne pourrait me convaincre de faire
ce que je m'apprête à faire !
Mettons-nous au lit.
Majesté.
Votre Majesté apprécie-t-elle
la Reine ?
Je ne l'aimais pas beaucoup avant,
je l'aime encore moins maintenant.
Elle n'a rien de plaisant
et son odeur me répugne.
Sa poitrine tombante
n'est qu'un des signes de sa vieillesse.
Je n'ai ni la volonté ni le courage
d'éprouver le reste.
Les physiques déplaisants
me rebutent.
Je l'ai laissée vierge.
À présent, laissez-moi.
Je suis très occupé.
Parlez !
- Je ne pouvais pas dormir. Qui est là ?
- Personne.
Retournez au lit.
Dois-je vous rejoindre ?
Si vous pouvez être
mon doux Charles.
Je suis aussi bon que possible.
Acceptez-moi tel que je suis.
Je vous aime, Catherine.
J'ai drainé le pus de la blessure
de Votre Majesté.
Votre Majesté
ne devrait plus souffrir.
Grâce à Dieu.
Pardonnez-moi,
mais Votre Majesté est-elle troublée
par autre chose ?
Je n'ai pu consommer mon mariage
avec Lady Anne.
Je trouve son corps tellement
déplaisant et repoussant
qu'il ne m'excite ni ne m'attire.
En avez-vous entendu parler ?
Pas du tout, Votre Majesté.
Cela n'a rien à voir
avec ma virilité.
En effet, dernièrement, j'ai eu des
pollutions nocturnes
durant mon sommeil.
Des émissions nocturnes...
Je me sais parfaitement capable
d'accomplir l'acte avec d'autres,
mais pas avec elle.
Avec elle, je n'ai aucun appétit
pour le devoir conjugal.
- Lord Cromwell ?
- Majesté.
Pouvons-nous parler seuls ?
Seuls ?
Oh, oui. Bien sûr.
My Lord.
Madame, une affaire délicate m'amène.
Pardonnez-moi.
Je dois vous mettre en garde
contre un conflit avec le Roi.
Il est de votre devoir
de faire tout votre possible
pour être agréable à ses yeux.
Sire...
je ne sais pas comment
j'ai donné offense à Sa Majesté.
Dans votre intérêt et le mien,
votre mariage avec le Roi
doit être un succès.
Si par exemple, vous vous
trouviez rapidement grosse...
Je suis désolé d'aborder
matière si intime, mais...
vous êtes la Reine d'Angleterre.
Rien de ce qui vous touche n'est privé.
Comment puis-je être
rapidement grosse
quand le Roi ne me touche pas ?
Je ne suis pas la Vierge Marie !
Vous dites
que je n'ai plus de vie privée.
Je dis à vous
que ce n'est pas plaisant.
Je ferais tout ce que veut le Roi,
mais parfois
sa blessure à la jambe est si laide.
Elle suppure et saigne.
Et elle empeste.
Ça pue. Ça sent, <i>ja </i> ?
Vous comprenez ?
Bien. Je suis désolée, My Lord.
Je continuerai
à faire tout ce que je peux
pour être agréable à Sa Majesté.
Elle est toujours douce et gentille.
Majesté.
Madame,
comment trouvez-vous le Roi ?
Pourquoi ?
Il est charmant et attentionné,
Lady Bryan.
Quand il vient au lit,
il m'embrasse,
prend ma main et me déclare :
"Bonne nuit, mon coeur".
Puis, au matin,
il m'embrasse à nouveau
et dit : "Adieu, chérie".
My Lady, nous espérons tous
que vous porterez un enfant.
Ce n'est pas encore le cas.
Mais comment le savez-vous ?
Je le sais très bien.
Je pense que Votre Majesté
est toujours vierge.
Il doit placer son membre en vous
et le faire bouger,
pour engendrer le Duc d'York
tant attendu.
Je suis comblée, Lady Bryan.
J'ai reçu du Roi toute l'attention
que je désire.
Je n'en sais pas plus.
Lady Bryan ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Si je ne peux satisfaire le Roi,
me tuera-t-il ?

- Master Holbein!
- My Lord.
I've... I've a commission for you.
The Duke of Cleves has given
you permission
to paint his daughter, Anne.
You should leave at once.
There're so many pressing things and
you've time to talk about a painting?
This is no ordinary painting,
A great many things hang upon it.
To that effect, however
you should find the lady,
whatever her actual appearance,
I pray you use your art and give her
at least a pleasing countent
Even if she is as ugly as sin?
I truly hope she is not so.
But still, you wish me,
if necessary to lie?
Surely, all art is a lie,
master Holbein.
My Lords, since the signing
of the Treaty of Toledo
Between the French king
and the Emperor
There've been vital
and unavoidable signs
of their mutual preparations for war
Against this realm.
You know in this how much they've
been urged on by the Vicar of Rome
and now we hear competent
reports of fleets
Gathering at Antwerp and Bologna.
And of an army of the Netherlands.
Furthermore, the French and Imperial
ambassadors
Have been recalled by their masters.
My Lords,
we've not been idle
under such provocations
Defence forces have been mastered
and beacon set along the coast
for warning.
Work has also begun building
artillery forts facing
the English Channel.
In the North, we have strengthen
our borders against the Scots.
And His Majesty's fleet warships
has been provisioned.
Foreign vessels are being forbidden
to leave these shores
without Royal permission.
My Lords.
How can anyone doubt that the
Pope, that pestilent idol,
that enemy of truth,
the usurper of all princes,
is now conspiring
to corrupt England's religion
and strip her of her wealth.
My Lords, at such a time,
it is good for me to be amongst
my people.
I'll visit all the places
where the barricades
and the defences
of the realm are being built
for the encouragement of my troops.
And to my enemies' terror.
My Lords.
Your Majesty.
It seems we are threatened
from everywhere, Sir Francis.
Scotland, Spain, the Low Countries.
We are like a morsel among
these choppers.
I'll tell you something else.
According to Cromwell's agents,
Just two weeks ago, Cardinal Pole
left Rome in a secret mission.
Shall we be after him again? As soon
as we've more news of his whereabouts,
we shall.
Sharpen your knives.
Your Grace.
- My Lord.
- Can we talk?
- In private?
- Sometime. Not now.
Mr. Holbein has sent this portrait
of Anne de Cleves,
your Majesty.
She is pleasing.
Has our ambassador been able
to see her properly?
Yes, Sir John has written to me in
great praise of the princesses person.
He writes, "she's incomparable
and excels the Duchess of Milan
as the golden sun excels
the silver moon".
Majesty,
if I may.
Marriage to the Duchess of Milan
is no longer an option.
Nor since the Emperor and the French
are in league against us.
Or any of the French women.
Your Majesty is beset by enemies.
Marriage to Anne of Cleves
would bring with it the military
and financial support
of the Protestant League.
What?
- What's it?
- Enemy ships,
flying the Black Eagle.
Give it a look.
It's appeared on the ships.
For Lord's sake!
Light the beacon!
Hurry!
Light it!
God save us!
Duke William,
his Majesty is much taken
by the portrait of your sister, Anne.
He encourages you to send ambassadors
to England
to conclude the negociations
including the question of your
sister's dowry and so on.
Once again,
his Majesty is premature.
But surely, your highness...
I think the king should come to me
publicly
And on bended knee
to beg for my sister's hand.
And for the protection
of the League.
In any case,
Anne was already promised, formerly
to the Duke of Lorraine's son.
And I don't see how I can break
that promise
- or keep my honor.
- Your highness,
if true, this is most unexpected
and unwelcome news.
That is because you expected
from the start to have your way
with Cleves and my sister.
But my country is not a brothel
and my sister is not a whore.
Well...
If your master truly desires
to have an alliance,
then he must demonstrate his respect
for my country...
and put a better price
on my sister's virginity.
Make way!
Thank you.
Come on.
Message for His Majesty!
Majesty.
From Sir Thomas Chaining,
warden of the Sank Ports.
Your Majesty, Lords of the Council,
this morning we counted
68 Imperial ships in the Channel.
I sent out two ships and afterwards
my bowmen
were taken aboard
the Imperial flagship
and shown every courtesy
by the Admiral.
He said his fleet was bound
for Spain,
and not England.
That he meant no harm to either us
or our coast.
If they doubt this word,
they ought to see
How poorly armed the ships were.
Quick more like merchantmen,
That hold both the provisions for
Emperor's voyage to Constantinople.
The Imperial ambassador,
your majesty.
I thought you'd been recalled.
There was some talk, your majesty.
But I had no desire to leave here,
Not that I think
there was any cause.
Of course.
But your master and the French king
have formed an alliance against me.
There appears to have been preparations
for an invasion encouraged
by the Vicar of Rome.
Your Majesty, I've been in this job
for a long time,
I know when to believe what I am told,
and when not to.
Which is most of the time.
Although the Emperor publicly embraced
the French king,
And even gave him the Order of
the Golden Fleece from around his neck,
He still continues to hate him.
More than any other enemy,
my master fears the Turks.
And yet the French are
in league with them.
How is such behavior from another
Christian Monarch to be forgiven?
Then they are no longer
in the alliance?
The accord has already broken down.
Which means that
the Duchess of Milan is
once more available for your
Majesties bed.
It's to late, Mr. Chapuys.
Tell me,
am I to be relived that once more,
I've been used as a pawn in a game
between your master and
the French King?
I tell you this here and now,
I've had enough, Mr. Chapuys.
I've had enough.
You may leave.
I'm surprised to see you back
so soon, Excellences.
We have good news, your Highness.
How so?
His Majesty so desires
to marry your sister, Anne,
That he is willing to forfeit
the requirements of a dowry.
- He wants nothing?
- Only his new bride,
in the shorter time as possible.
His Majesty will also pay
your Highness
a considerable stipend
for introducing him to the League.
However, we recall that your sister
is already promised to the son
of the Duke of Lorraine.
Yes, that was indeed
a great obstacle.
However, on closer consideration
we have discovered that
the contract was never ratified.
And so is not binding in law
or any other way.
So your sister is free
to marry the king?
I will send my ambassadors to England
to conclude the negociations.
Gentlemen.
What's this?
Cromwell's agents, finally intercepted
a letter from Cardinal Pole.
He was on his way to Rome.
I have managed to decode it.
May I see?
To Cardinal Von Waldburg.
Supposed to travel to Paris,
to meet King Francis.
Have already written,
telling him I found the Emperor
very sympathetic to my mission.
But fear it is not so.
The Emperor fears the Turk
more than king Henry,
so I believe he will not act
against him.
So, postpone journey.
Will go instead to papal city
of Carpentras.
I wait further instructions
from his Holiness.
Have you ever been to Carpentras?
No...
but I'm dying to go.
The Duke of Sufolk, My Lord.
Your Grace.
To what do I owe this honor?
I'm here to congratulate you.
The king has made you Earl of Hartford.
And I believe it is time to patch up
our past quarrels and difficulties.
We have better quarrels to be added.
I am happy to agree with your grace.
- Drink?
- Please.
Please.
I am commanded to meet
the Princess at Calais.
Great, many things hang up
on this marriage, do they not?
The King's happiness, for one.
And my Lord Cromwell's reputation.
What a pity if all should go awry.
I would have pity for the King.
But on the other hand?
- Salut!
- Salut!
So, he is marrying
a Lutheran heretic?
- So it seems.
- And I shall marry no one?!
- My lady... I...
- No, I prefer it.
Do you suppose I'd like
to be married off to the Dukes brother,
or some heretic cousin of his?
I would prefer to live in a nunnery.
Like, you don't know
what to think of the King,
He burns one Lucifer,
and then marries another?
If God so wills it,
she might drown at sea.
Chequers, Calais
English Occupied France.
Gentlemen,
we bid you welcome to Calais
on this most auspicious occasion.
"Danke."
May I present to you, His Grace,
the Duke of Suffolk.
Your Grace, I'm honored.
I am Herr Hoghesten,
and this is Count Olisleger.
"Hallo!"
And here, is she,
Her Highness Princess Anne.
After a long time, my God!
Your Highness.
Good day, your Grace.
I'm afraid the bad weather will prevent
our sailing for a few days.
I understand.
Perhaps your Grace could...
help me to explain
how the English are eating?
Of course.
And maybe...
show me some things
the king likes to do?
His Majesty likes to play cards
and gamble.
- Do you play?
- No.
I think, only the men play the cards
in my country.
And, is it not bad to gamble?
Only if you can afford to lose.
We'll play Piquet,
it's not hard to learn.
Das ist gut.
There are 4 suits of cards.
Spades, clubs,
diamonds and hearts.
Hearts? You play with hearts?
Sometimes.
And here we have aces, kings,
queens and knaves.
Then all the Court is here, ja?
Does the king always win?
His Majesty does not like losing.
What have they told you
about the king?
Why?
What is it I should know?
Carpentras
Papal Enclave of Venaissin
- You are Francis Bryan?
- You can take us to the Cardinal?
Si. Yes. Come quickly.
He is with us.
Where is the bastard?
Sorry senor.
Prego,
go with God my sons.
We'll never catch him.
It's a waste of time.
Perhaps not.
Holy Mary pray for us...
and deliver me from my ennemies
Amen.
- You didn't see her face?
- No Your Majesty.
But she plays cards as pleasantly
and with as good a grace
as any other noble woman.
She's come to Rochester.
I'm due to meet her
in three days time.
I tell you I'm more impatient
than ever to see her.
What of Sir Francis Bryan?
He and Sir Thomas Seymour are now
to Carpentras.
Where Cardinal Pole is supposed
to be hiding.
It appears he has grown fearful
of assassination.
He's every right to be so.
I swear that man should be flamed alive
and I should wear his skin as a shirt.
He will doom the day he allowed the Pope
to use and to threaten me.
I tell you,
I cannot abide this waiting.
It's been a long time.
I need to nourish love.
- I can understand.
- Can you?
I want to possess this woman
And I haven't even seen her.
She's a complete stranger to me.
What if I can't?
What if you can't... what?
Broom.
- Majesty.
- Fetch the master of the horse,
I live for Rochester immediately.
Go!
Make way!
Dismount!
Tell the lady a gentleman has come
to see her, bearing a New Year's gift.
I'm here to welcome you to my realm.
I trust you are comfortable here?
Before your journey to London.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I'll see you in London.
I should have taken more
lessons from the Duke.
English manners are very
different from ours.
I like her not!
Do you understand me?
I like her not!
Call a meeting of the Council.
It seems, that Princes in marriage
suffer more then poor men.
Since they have to take
what is brought to them,
while poor man are
at liberty to choose.
I have been deceived
about Anne of Cleves.
She is nothing like
what was reported to me. Nothing!
She looks like a horse!
A furless mare!
Your Majesty will remember
that it was Sir John
who described her as being like a...
I never saw her properly,
which was not my fault.
I carried out my commission
as best I could,
and I told you I was no good
with women.
My Lord Cromwell.
Do you deny
that you spoke to me of her beauty?
Of the desirability
of my marriage to her?
No. Your Majesty.
And if I had misled your Majesty
and His Council
by commendations based on false reports,
then, I am truly sorry for them.
If I had known what I know now,
she would never have been brought here!
What remedy Mr. Cromwell?
Your Majesty have to say
that there is none.
That's the case, you've been following
the Cleves agenda since the beginning.
Go on.
Today, the Emperor is the guest
of the King of France.
They have renewed their alliance.
If we now reject our German allies,
then England will remain alone
and friendless and at the mercy
of the King and Emperor.
Your Majesty, if you break this
marriage contract now
you risk the possibility that even
Duke William himself
might retaliate against us.
I am sorry that your Majesty has
no better contempt.
I'm not well handled, Sir Cromwell.
Majesty.
Milady.
I am here to welcome you
to what is yours.
Your Majesty is very gracious
and I am very happy.
My daughters, Princess Mary...
The Princess Elizabeth.
For you... I think they are pretty.
Thank you Princess.
I think you are pretty too.
I shall love them both.
I like her not.
But it seems
Your Majesty must marry her.
Who says I must? Cromwell?
I have my lawyers working on it.
The betrothed can be prevented
on two grounds:
Either the German envoy fails to bring
the commission from the Duke
authorizing them to conclude
the legalities of the marriage,
Or they can't provide
written evidence
that her betrothed was formerly
revoked. Either way I can get out of it.
I wish in my heart that your majesty
is successful.
It seems to me that my lord Cromwell
is to keen to stress there's no remedy.
The marriage was his idea.
There were other candidates.
The Duchess of Milan is supposed to be
the most desirable woman in the world!
Instead of which...
Perhaps, in this matter,
Lord Cromwell...
has overreached himself.
Perhaps.
Oh God!
If there is no remedy I must put
my neck into this yoke.
I'm sorry Lord Cromwell,
I didn't see you, I...
I was talking to God.
But surely say you have to go
to church for that.
Do you understand nothing
about Reforms?
God is not just in church, he is...
everywhere.
We do not need priests
to speak for us.
We can... speak to Him ourselves,
and He will listen.
There's no need for bells,
and books and candles.
All you need is... your soul.
Now go away. Think.
Wait!
Today is the fifth of the Epiphany,
and my wedding day.
So, there is no legal remedy?
None that it was possible to discover,
Your Majesty.
I am not well handled.
I think when Your Majesty gets to know
the lady better...
I don't want to know
the lady better Mr Cromwell!
The notion of it repulses me.
My Lord, if it were not to satisfy
the world and my realm,
I would not do what I must do this day
for no earthly thing!
Shall we to bed?
Majesty.
How does
Your Majesty like the Queen?
My Lord, I didn't like her very much
before, I like her much worse now.
She is nothing fair
and has evil smells about her.
She's no maid because of the looseness
of her breasts and other tokens.
So I had neither the will
nor the courage to prove the rest.
I have no appetite
for unpleasant airs.
I left her as good a maid
as I found her.
And now my Lord, leave me.
I'm very busy.
Speak out!
- I couldn't sleep. Who is there?
- No one.
Go back to bed.
Should I come to you later?
If you could still be
my sweet Charles.
I am as good as I may be.
Can't you take me as I am?
I love you Catherine.
I have drained to the pus
from Your Majesty's wound.
Your Majesty should feel
no more pain.
I expede to God.
Forgive me,
but is Your Majesty troubled by...
other things?
I have been unabled to consumate
my marriage with Lady Anne.
I find her body in such a sort,
disordered and indisposed,
that it doesn't excite me
or provoke any lust in me.
Have you heard any rumors of it?
Not at all, Your Majesty.
It has not anything to do
with my virility.
Indeed, these last nights,
I have had
pollutione and nocturne in somno.
Two nocturnal emissions...
You see, I know myself perfectly able
to... perform the act with others,
just not with her.
With her I have no appetite to do
what a man should do with his wife.
- My Lord Cromwell?
- Majesty.
May we speak alone?
Alone?
Oh, yeah. Of course.
My Lord.
Madam, I've come on a delicate matter,
forgive me.
I... must warn you
againt antagonizing the King.
I must remind you
of the expediency of doing your utmost
to make yourself agreable... to him.
Sir...
I am not sure
how I given His Majesty offence.
It is in your interest and in mine
to make your marriage to the King
a sucess.
If for example, you were...
to find yourself,
quick with child...
I'm sorry to talk
in such intimate matters, but...
You are the Queen of England, you have
nothing private anymore.
How am I to become quick with child
when the king leaves me a maid?
I am not the Virgin Mary!
You say I have nothing private,
Then I say you
it is not all pleasing.
I would do anything the King wants,
but sometimes,
The score on his leg is bad.
It oczes blood and pus.
And it smells.
It stinks. It smells, yeah?
You understand?
Now, I am sorry, My Lord.
I will go on,
doing all that I can to make myself
agreable to His Majesty.
He is always gracious and kind.
Majesty.
Madam, how do you find the king?
Why,
he is most kind and solicitousness,
Lady Bryan.
When he comes to bed, he kisses me.
Takes my hand,
bids me "good night sweetheart".
Then, in the morning,
he kisses me again.
And says: farewell darling.
My lady,
we all hope you'll be with child soon.
I know very well, I am not.
But, how do you know you are not?
I know it well, I am not.
I think
your Majesty is a maid still.
He must put his member inside you
and stir it.
Or else we'll not have a Duke of York,
which is all this realm desires.
I am contented Lady Bryan.
I received as much
of the king's attention as I wish.
I know no more!
Lady Bryan?
Yes, Your Majesty.
If I don't please the king...
will he kill me?

Pour LauCass
My Lords,
j'ai passé presque chaque nuit
avec la Reine
ces derničres semaines,
mais ma conscience m'interdit
de consommer ce mariage
parce que je sens
qu'il y a un obstacle.
J'ai fait tout mon possible
pour convaincre mon cśur
et mon esprit, mais l'obstacle
ne quitte pas mes pensées.
En vérité, peut-ętre
existait-il un contrat
entre le fils du Duc de Lorraine
et la Princesse,
dont elle n'a jamais été libérée,
et par conséquent
je suis marié ŕ la femme d'un autre.
My Lords,
je vous laisse le soin de vérifier
si mes doutes sont justifiés ou non.
Votre Majesté.
My Lord, vous devez trouver un moyen
de soulager le coeur de Sa Majesté.
Je vous le dis, Charles,
Dieu ne me donnera plus d'enfants
si je persiste dans ce mariage.
Était-elle si innocente
qu'elle ne savait que faire ?
Ne pas dire ŕ une femme ce qui l'attend
la nuit de ses noces, c'est...
comme partir en mer sans provisions.
Je forcerai Cromwell ŕ trouver
une raison de dissoudre ce mariage.
J'y ai consenti
pour le bien du royaume
et c'est oublié.
L'Empereur et le Roi de France sont
ŕ nouveau en désaccord
et tous deux me courtisent.
Qui a besoin de Clčves ?
My Lord Cromwell.
N'était-ce pas son idée ?
La Princesse Mary.
Princesse, je vous en prie.
J'ai reçu une lettre de mon cousin,
le Duc Philippe de Bavičre.
Il aimerait venir
en Angleterre vous faire la cour.
Pourquoi ?
Il a tellement entendu
parler de vous.
Toujours en bien.
J'imagine qu'il est luthérien
aussi.
Il est charmant
et trčs beau.
Vous pourriez l'aimer un peu.
Que dois-je lui dire ?
Dites-lui...
Dites-lui de venir s'il le veut
et si le Roi y consent.
Mais qu'il n'attende rien.
Pčre ?
Gregory !
Que fais-tu donc ici ?
Vous avez oublié vos pilules
chez l'apothicaire.
Je ne voulais pas
que vous souffriez.
Assieds-toi.
Sur quoi travaillez-vous ?
Des projets de lois pour le Parlement
sur la profession médicale.
Et j'essaie de convaincre Sa Majesté
de nommer les conseillers au mérite
et rien d'autre.
Vous ętes fatigué, Pčre.
Comment va Sa Majesté ?
Elle va bien.
Sa jambe l'incommode
et lui fait mal.
Elle devient irritable.
Est-ce pour ça qu'elle vous tape
sur la tęte, parfois ?
Je n'en veux pas au Roi
mais d'autres cherchent ŕ me nuire
parce je suis né si bas
et eux si haut.
Et... aussi pour d'autres raisons.
N'y pense pas.
Occupe-toi de ton épouse
et de l'enfant qu'elle attend.
Aime-les comme tu aimes Dieu
et sa parole,
et tout ira bien.
Je regrette
que vous n'ayez pas capturé
Reginald Pole, Sir Francis.
Le Roi le déteste entre tous.
Cependant,
il a autre chose en tęte.
J'ai parlé ŕ Sa Majesté
qui m'a avoué ętre
- quelque peu fatiguée de sa vie.
- De sa vie ou de sa femme ?
Ça revient au męme.
Ne peut-elle trouver une distraction
comme elle l'a toujours fait ?
Aisément.
Mais elle est plus blasée qu'avant.
Les recours habituels seront vains.
Quelque chose de plus...
extręme... pourrait la tenter.
Dans ce domaine au moins,
Votre Grâce,
je ne décevrai pas le Roi.
- My Lady.
- My Lady.
Sir ?
Princesse Mary,
pardonnez ma brusquerie.
Nous aurions dű ętre
présentés officiellement mais...
j'étais impatient.
Vous ętes le Duc Philippe ?
Puis-je baiser votre main ?
J'espčre vous revoir, My Lady.
En présence de ma cousine la Reine,
bien sűr.
Je pensais quitter la cour demain
pour la campagne.
Je pourrais retarder mon départ,
si vous le voulez.
D'une journée.
Mon cher Francis,
vous m'avez manqué !
Toujours aussi beau.
Cela fait des mois que je ne vous ai vu.
Que faisiez-vous ?
- Je tentais de tuer quelqu'un.
- Avec succčs ?
Pas encore.
Ętes-vous venu voir
mes petites chéries ?
Aprčs vous avoir vue, chčre madame.
Allez-y.
J'en ai de nouvelles, je crois.
Trčs jolies.
J'ai parfois du mal ŕ croire
que celles qui les ont portées
ne se sont pas souciées
ou senties obligées de les élever.
- La plupart sont des bâtardes.
- Mais
des bâtardes aristocrates, mon cher.
Des bâtardes aristocrates.
Faites une robe ŕ notre poupée.
- Qui pensez-vous qu'il soit ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Il s'est battu en duel ?
- Pensez-vous ?
Sir ?
J'ai trouvé quelqu'un
pour divertir le Roi.
Qui est-ce ?
Catherine Howard.
Une parente éloignée du Duc de Norfolk.
Son passé est...
Comment dire ?
Peu conventionnel.
- J'imagine qu'elle est jeune et jolie.
- Jugez vous-męme, My Lord.
Vous pouvez entrer.
Voici les personnes
dont je vous ai parlé :
Sa Grâce, le Duc de Suffolk,
et le comte de Hertford.
- Vos Grâces.
- Quel âge as-tu ?
Dix-sept ans.
Je me demande
qui lui a appris ŕ compter.
Parle-nous de toi, de ta famille.
Ma mčre est morte
quand j'étais petite.
Mon pčre s'est remarié,
mais je ne connais pas bien
sa femme.
On m'a envoyée vivre
chez la Duchesse douairičre.
La Duchesse douairičre de Norfolk ?
- La veuve du deuxičme Duc.
- Je crois, My Lord.
Je ne la vois pas beaucoup.
Il y avait d'autres enfants,
de beaucoup de mariages.
Nous n'étions pas surveillés.
C'était assez amusant.
Bien, chčre Catherine,
je pense
que l'amusement va recommencer.
Qu'en pensez-vous ?
Je pense,
je pense
qu'elle convient pour un roi.
Lui avez-vous parlé ? Ŕ Philippe ?
Un peu.
C'est un jeune homme
trčs intelligent.
Je ne saurais le dire.
Et trčs beau.
Il vous aime beaucoup.
Il ne me connaît męme pas.
Nous n'avons rien en commun.
Votre Majesté, le Duc Philippe
vous demande audience.
Je ne veux pas le voir.
Alors cachez-vous lŕ. Vite !
Philippe.
Mon cher cousin.
Majesté.
Comment trouvez-vous le pays ?
Je l'aime beaucoup.
Je vivrais heureux ici.
Avez-vous rencontré
la Princesse Mary ?
Juste un instant
mais je revis ce moment
dans ma tęte encore et encore.
On m'avait dit
qu'elle était charmante, intelligente,
cultivée, bienveillante.
Digne héritičre de Catherine d'Aragon.
Une vraie princesse.
Mais rien ne m'avait préparé
ŕ sa beauté.
Une beauté qui vient de l'intérieur.
Pour moi,
elle est la plus belle de la terre.
Le Conseil a agi ŕ la demande
de Votre Majesté.
Nous avons exigé la preuve écrite
du contrat prénuptial
avec le fils du Duc de Lorraine.
Ils nous l'ont fournie
mais les documents suggčrent
qu'au lieu de la formule usuelle
"<i>per verba de futuro</i>"
les mots utilisés sont en fait
"<i>per verba de presenti</i>".
C'est donc un contrat
- que le délaissement ne peut défaire.
- Alors on dirait
que Votre Majesté
a raison d'ętre optimiste.
Le Roi vous a remarquée.
Il pourrait demander ŕ vous voir.
Que devrais-je lui dire ?
Que devrais-je faire ?
Soyez vous-męme.
Qui est-ce ?
C'est Katherine Howard.
C'est une parente du Duc de Norfolk.
Elle vient d'arriver.
Amenez-la moi.
Majesté.
Majesté,
Mademoiselle Katherine Howard.
Merci, Charles.
Katherine.
Votre Majesté.
Je vous en prie, asseyez-vous.
- Ętes-vous mariée ?
- Non, Votre Majesté.
- Savez-vous lire ?
- Assez pour écrire une lettre.
Qui vous écrit ?
Personne.
Avez-vous beaucoup de maisons ?
- Aďe !
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
Vous m'avez marché sur le pied.
Philip, je suis vraiment désolée !
Je vous présente mes excuses.
Philip, je suis désolée !
- Je pensais...
- Vous ne m'avez pas marché dessus.
Comment pourriez-vous ?
Vos pieds ne touchent pas terre.
Je voulais un moment seul avec vous.
Je...
Vous pleurez.
C'est parce que je suis heureuse.
Voudriez-vous m'embrasser
ŕ nouveau ?
Savez-vous d'oů vient cette bague ?
Du tombeau de Thomas Becket
ŕ Canterbury.
Le tombeau entier
brillait des joyaux
laissés par les princes
et les pčlerins.
Mais cette bague...
Cette bague était le cadeau
le plus précieux.
Un Roi de France l'a laissée
en offrande pour sauver son âme.
Puis-je la toucher ?
Bonne nuit, Princesse.
Bonne nuit, Votre Grâce.
Dites-moi, M. Cromwell,
oů en sont les travaux
de mon palais de Sans-Pareil ?
Il est presque achevé
et sera pręt
pour votre inspection de juillet.
Je veux offrir des terres
ŕ Katherine Howard.
Nous en avons confisqué ŕ un félon,
si je me souviens bien.
Avec deux grandes maisons dessus.
Je désire accorder le tout
ŕ Mademoiselle Howard.
Majesté.
Le conseil aurait trouvé une faille
dans le contrat prénuptial.
Elle n'est pas suffisante
ŕ elle seule pour justifier
la répudiation de la Reine.
Il faudra l'étayer.
Je pense qu'elle n'est pas
mon épouse légitime.
Quoi que dise le peuple,
que vous le sachiez ou non,
vous ętes encore
mon premier ministre,
dont l'amour et la loyauté
n'ont aucune raison
d'ętre remis en cause.
Si quelque chose d'important
doit ętre fait,
je sais ce qui est le mieux.
Majesté.
- M. Cromwell !
- M. Cromwell !
- M. Cromwell !
- M. Risley.
- Donnez-ça ŕ M. Risley.
- Nous faisons de notre mieux.
Nous ferons de notre mieux pour vous.
Trčs bien.
- M. Risley ! Merci, monsieur.
- Merci. Merci.
- La rencontre avec l'ambassadeur ?
- C'était...
trčs intéressant, Votre Majesté.
Le Roi entamerait volontiers
des négociations avec nous
en vue de libérer les Français
de leur alliance avec l'Empereur.
Bien.
L'ambassadeur m'a aussi
fait remarquer
ŕ quel point les relations
franco-anglaises s'amélioreraient
si Lord Cromwell
n'y faisait pas obstacle.
Mademoiselle Howard ?
Le Roi voudrait
que vous acceptiez un présent.
C'est ravissant.
Vous remercierez Sa Majesté.
Vous pouvez la remercier vous-męme.
Votre Majesté.
Entrez.
Évęque Gardiner.
L'homme qu'il nous fallait.
Nous pouvons commencer.
Gregory ? Qu'y a-t-il ?
C'est un garçon.
Un garçon. J'ai un fils.
Dieu soit loué.
Le Prince Edward, Votre Majesté.
Mon fils.
Mon fils.
Messieurs, j'ai demandé
cette réunion du Conseil pour...
Cromwell, ne vous asseyez pas lŕ.
Il n'y a pas de place pour vous.
Pas de traîtres parmi nous.
My Lord Cromwell,
nous vous arrętons pour trahison.
Je ne suis pas un traître.
J'en appelle ŕ votre conscience.
Suis-je un traitre ?
Oui ! Traître ! Traître !
Traître ! Traître !
Traître ! Traître !
Traître !
Je ne suis pas un traître !
Je ne suis pas un traître !
Je ne suis pas un traître !
Princesse Mary, asseyez-vous.
J'ai des... des nouvelles.
Le Duc Philip est retourné
en Bavičre.
Votre pčre, le Roi,
l'y a renvoyé. Je suis désolée.
Je ne peux pas expliquer.
Pas besoin d'explication.
Ça a peu d'importance.
Le Duc était charmant
mais je ne l'aurais jamais épousé.
Il est luthérien
et je suis catholique.
My Lords, je suis ici
pour déposer un acte d'accusation
contre Thomas Cromwell
pour cause de trahison.
Lord Cromwell,
que Sa Majesté
a élevé de la plus humble
et basse condition, et enrichi
par de nombreux présents,
s'est révélé ętre le plus
déloyal et corrompu
des traîtres et des tricheurs.
En hérétique exécrable,
il s'est arrangé pour organiser
et encourager l'insurrection
parmi les loyaux et aimants sujets
de Sa Majesté.
Vice-régent des affaires spirituelles,
il était censé superviser la réforme.
Mais, ŕ l'insu de Sa Majesté,
Cromwell
a permis aux hérétiques
de pręcher et d'enseigner.
My Lords,
nous avons la preuve
que dans la nuit du 31 mars,
dans la paroisse
Saint-Pierre le Pauvre,
Lord Cromwell a défendu
orgueilleusement
ces prédicateurs hérétiques.
Il a dit que si le Roi
s'en prenait ŕ la Réforme,
il ne le suivrait pas.
Et si le Roi le faisait,
soutenu par ses partisans,
alors il lutterait
sur le champ de bataille
contre le Roi
et tous ses partisans.
Et il a sorti son poignard et dit :
"Laissez ce poignard
me transpercer le cśur
"si je ne meurs pas dans ce combat.
"Et si je dois encore vivre
un an ou deux,
"ce sera sans l'autorité du Roi
pour empęcher ou gęner
notre réforme. "
Et il pręta serment.
Traître ! Traître !
Traître ! Traître !
Est-il vrai que vous aimiez
cet homme, Sir Richard ?
Comme ami.
Mais j'aimais surtout
l'amour que je croyais voir en lui,
principalement envers le Roi.
Si c'est un traître, je suis désolé
de l'avoir aimé ou cru
et je suis trčs heureux
que sa trahison ait été découverte
ŕ temps.
Traître ! Traître ! Justice !
J'espčre
que vous ętes heureuse et bien traitée.
Je n'ai aucune plainte ŕ formuler.
Oů que j'aille,
je suis traitée avec respect
et bonté par tout le monde.
J'en suis heureux.
Vous ne mangez pas.
Votre Majesté,
je me demandais...
Je vais vous envoyer quelques temps
ŕ mon palais de Richmond.
Pour votre santé et votre plaisir.
Merci, Votre Majesté.
Je dois m'occuper
d'affaires urgentes.
Le Conseil est d'avis
qu'en tant que chef de l'Église,
l'évęque est compétent
pour annuler votre mariage.
Mais...
il serait plus diplomatique
de prouver
que le mariage n'a pas été consommé
et que vous n'y avez jamais
vraiment consenti.
Envoyez une délégation
ŕ M. Cromwell.
Demandez-lui un témoignage écrit
appuyant l'annulation.
Il se souviendra sans aucun doute
ŕ quel point je hais cette femme.
Monsieur Cromwell.
Votre Grâce.
Le Roi vous ordonne
d'écrire une lettre
décrivant ses impressions
ŕ propos d'Anne de Clčves,
ce qu'il s'est dit entre vous
ŕ ce sujet,
et précisant s'il vous a dit
avoir consommé
son soi-disant mariage ou non.
Il vous ordonne également
de confirmer
que malgré les empęchements
ŕ ce mariage,
vous l'avez quand męme organisé.
Sa Majesté exige que,
vu votre responsabilité devant Dieu
au jour du jugement dernier,
mais également l'extręme danger
de damnation de vos âme
et conscience,
vous écriviez exactement
ce que vous savez.
Je me ferai un plaisir d'obéir
au Roi.
Je souhaite son plaisir
et sa satisfaction.
Je désire son bien-ętre avant tout
et mourrais volontiers pour ça.
Pouvez-vous voir votre maison
de cette fenętre ?
En réalité, Monsieur Cromwell,
ŕ peine deux heures
aprčs votre arrestation,
le Roi y a envoyé son trésorier
pour confisquer vos biens.
Le peuple s'est assemblé
pour l'acclamer.
C'était un spectacle
tout ŕ fait charmant, m'a-t-on dit.
Garde.
"Votre Majesté semblant
moins heureuse
"que je ne l'attendais, j'ai osé
"vous demander ŕ quel point
vous aimiez la Reine.
"Votre Majesté répondit gravement :
"Je ne l'aimais déjŕ pas beaucoup
avant
"mais je l'aime encore moins
maintenant.
"J'ai palpé son ventre
et sa poitrine
"et, autant que je puisse en juger,
"elle n'est pas vierge.
"Je l'ai laissée aussi vierge
que je l'ai trouvée."
Ŕ la fin.
Que dit-il ŕ la fin ?
"Je supplie humblement Votre Majesté
"de pardonner mon écriture grossičre
et de considérer que,
"malheureux prisonnier,
je suis pręt ŕ accepter la mort
dčs que Dieu et Votre Majesté
le souhaiteront. "
<i>"Pourtant, ma lâcheté me pousse</i>
<i>"sans cesse ŕ demander ŕ Votre Grâce
sa pitié</i>
<i>"et le pardon de mes offenses.</i>
<i>"Que le Christ vous sauve,</i>
<i>vous préserve et vous garde.</i>
<i>"Fait ŕ la Tour, ce mercredi,</i>
<i>"dernier jour de juin,
le cśur lourd et la main tremblante,</i>
"par le plus misérable prisonnier
de Votre Grandeur,
"par son esclave. "
Il a écrit quelque chose
tout en bas.
"Trčs aimable prince,
j'implore votre clémence, clémence,
clémence. "
Votre Grâce ira-t-elle
ŕ la Tour demain ?
Essayez de m'en empęcher.
Je peux garantir ŕ Votre Grâce
que le bouquet final
sera le plus ignominieux qui soit.
Il paraît, Votre Grâce.
Il paraît.
De quoi parle-t-il ?
Dites-moi.
Cromwell sera exécuté
sur le męme échafaud
que Lord Hungerford,
également nommé Walter le fou,
condamné ŕ mort
pour plusieurs délits
tels que sodomie, viol de sa fille
et rétribution de sorciers
pour prédire la date de la mort du Roi.
Il n'aura pas ŕ payer
pour connaître la date de la sienne.
Ainsi, Cromwell sera humilié.
Ce rustre perfide si ambitieux
et manipulateur !
Ce n'est pas notre seul projet.
Tom et moi avons prévu
d'autres divertissements
aux frais de Son Excellence.
Lesquels ?
Patience, Edward.
Patience.
Prenons une autre bičre.
Excusez-moi.
J'ai oublié votre nom, mon garçon.
- Quel est-il ?
- Gurrea, monsieur.
Gurrea. Vous avez la vérole
ou vous ętes guéri, 'urrea ?
Demain est un grand jour.
Je devrais ętre couché.
Un dernier verre. Je paie.
Buvons aux vieux amis, d'accord ?
Deux autres pintes, garçon !
Maître Gurrea,
j'espčre que vous avez
les idées claires, ce matin.
Madame, le Comte de Hartford
est arrivé.
My Lords.
Il est de mon devoir de vous informer
que le Parlement
et les assemblées de Canterbury
et de York
ont annulé votre mariage avec le Roi
en raison de votre accord
avec le Duc de Lorraine,
de la réticence de Sa Majesté
pour ce mariage,
et de sa non-consommation.
Le mariage est donc déclaré nul
et désormais, le Roi souhaite
que vous vous considériez
comme sa soeur.
Y consentez-vous ?
Auquel cas, le Roi
vous octroiera la confortable somme
de 4000 livres par an,
les manoirs de Bletchingly
et de Richmond
et le château d'Hever,
tant que vous resterez en Angleterre.
Et puisque Sa Majesté confirme
que vous ętes toujours vierge,
vous ętes libre d'épouser
l'homme de votre choix.
Je vous prie
de dire au Roi que
j'espčre qu'il me fera
parfois le plaisir
de sa noble présence,
et supplie le Tout-Puissant
de lui accorder longue vie
et bonne santé.
My Lady !
Pčre !
Chers amis,
je suis ici pour mourir
et pas pour me disculper,
comme certains pourraient le croire.
J'ai été condamné ŕ mort
et je remercie Dieu
de m'accorder cette mort
pour mes péchés,
car depuis ma majorité,
j'ai vécu en pécheur
et offensé Dieu.
De tout cśur, je Lui demande pardon.
Finissez-en !
Pour l'amour du Christ, finissez-en !
J'ai aussi offensé mon Prince,
ŕ qui je demande l'absolution.
Je vous demande ardemment
de prier pour le Roi,
qu'il vive longtemps parmi vous,
en bonne santé et prospčre,
et qu'aprčs lui, son fils,
le Prince Edward,
rčgne longtemps sur vous.
Le voilŕ.
Le palais de Sans-Pareil.
Mon bouffon dit qu'il n'existe pas.
Messires,
ne prenez pas exemple sur moi,
pauvre homme transformé
par le Prince
en gentilhomme, qui
n'ai pu me contenter
d'avoir le Royaume
sous mes ordres
et ai voulu m'élever encore.
Mon orgueil m'a apporté
son châtiment.
Dieu, accordez-moi
que quand ces yeux seront inutiles,

My lords,
I do confess to you that,
although I've lain
with the Queen almost every
night these past weeks,
my conscience will not permit me
to consummate this marriage
because I feel there is some
impediment to it.
I have done as much as any man
to move the consent of my heart
and mind, but the obstacle
will not out of my thoughts.
Perhaps the truth is that
there existed a precontract
between the Duke of Lorraine's
son and the Princess after all,
from which she was never
released, and so therefore
I am really married
to another man's wife.
My lords,
I leave it to you to investigate
whether or not
my scruples are justified.
Your Majesty.
My Lord, you must find some way
to relieve His Majesty's conscience.
I tell you, Charles,
God will not grant me any more children
if I continue in this marriage.
Was she such a maid that
she didn't know what to do?
Not telling a woman what she
must expect on her wedding night is...
like sending a sailor
to sea with no biscuit.
I will force Cromwell to bring about
a dissolution of the marriage.
I went ahead with it for the sake
of the realm and now even
that reason is forgot.
The Emperor and the King of France
are at each other's throats again
and both have come courting.
Who needs Cleves?
My Lord Cromwell.
Was the match not his idea?
Princess Mary is here.
Princess, if you please.
I have received a letter
from a cousin of mine.
He is Duke Philip of Bavaria.
Philip'd like.
To come to England
and pay court to you
Why?
He has heard many things
about you, Princess Mary.
Many good things.
I suppose he's a Lutheran,
like you?
He is charming
and very good looking.
I think you might like him a little.
What shall I tell him?
Tell him...
Tell him he may come if he
pleases and if the King wishes.
But not to expect anything.
Father?
Gregory!
What on earth are you doing here?
Well, I noticed you forgot
your pills at the apothecary.
I didn't want you to be in pain.
Sit down.
What are you working on?
I'm preparing bills for Parliament
on the medical profession.
And I'm trying
to persuade His Majesty
to appoint councillors based
upon merit,
and nothing else.
You look tired, father.
How is His Majesty?
He's fine.
His leg bothers him;
it gets sore. He gets irritable.
Is that why he strikes you
on the head sometimes?
I resent the King nothing,
but others seek to undermine me,
since I was born so low
and they so high...
And
for other reasons too.
Think not on that.
Look after your own dear wife,
and the child in her belly.
Love them as you love God
and His Holy Word,
and all shall be well.
I'm sorry you failed to
capture that traitor
Reginald Pole, Sir Francis.
The King detests him above all men.
However,
he has other matters
on his mind now.
When I last spoke to His Majesty
he confessed he was,
- in some ways, tired with his life.
- His life or his wife?
They are much the same thing.
Can he not find distraction,
as he has always done before?
Easily.
But he is more jaded than before.
The usual remedies won't suit.
Something more...
extreme...
might tempt him.
In this matter at least, Your Grace,
I shall not fail the King.
- My Lady.
- My Lady.
Sir?
Princess Mary, I hope
you can forgive my impetuosity.
I know we should have been
formally introduced, but...
I couldn't wait.
You are Duke Philip?
May I kiss your hand?
I hope I might
see you again, my Lady.
With my cousin the Queen
present, of course.
I had thought to leave court
tomorrow for the country.
I may delay my leaving,
if it pleases you.
For a day or so.
My sweet Francis, I missed you!
Handsome as ever.
We haven't seen you for ages.
What have you been doing?
- Trying to kill someone.
- Did you manage it?
Not yet.
I suppose you've come to look
over my little darlings?
Only after I've feasted
my eyes on you, my dear Lady.
Go along.
We have some new ones, I think.
Pretty little things.
I sometimes find it hard to
believe that whoever bore them
did not feel bothered
or obliged to raise them.
- Most of them were bastards.
- But
aristocratic bastards, my sweet boy.
Aristocratic bastards.
Make a dress for our doll.
- Who do you think he is?
- I don't know.
- He's been in a sword fight?
- Do you think he was?
Sir?
I have found someone
to amuse the King.
Who is she?
Miss Katherine Howard. She's a distant
relation to the Duke of Norfolk.
Her background is...
How shall I say?
Not entirely conventional.
I assume she's young and pretty.
See for yourself, my Lord.
You may come in now.
These are the excellent people
I told you of:
His Grace, the Duke of Suffolk,
and the Earl of Hertford.
- Your Graces.
- How old are you?
Seventeen.
I wonder who taught her to count.
Tell us something about
yourself. Your family. So on.
My mother died when I was little.
My father remarried,
but I didn't know his wife really.
I was sent to live in the household
of the Dowager Duchess.
That would be the Dowager
Duchess of Norfolk?
- The widow of the second Duke
- I suppose so, my Lord.
I didn't see her much.
There were other children there,
from lots of marriages.
We ran a little wild.
There was some fun in it.
Well, sweet Katherine,
I think the fun is
just about to start again.
What do you think, Your Grace?
I think,
I think she looks fit for a king.
Did you talk to him?
To Philip?
A little. Yes.
I believe he is a very
intelligent young man.
I couldn't tell.
And extremely good-looking.
He likes you a great deal.
He doesn't even know me.
We've nothing in common.
Your Majesty, Duke Philip
asks for an audience.
I don't want to see him.
Then go in there! Quickly.
Ah, Philip.
My dear cousin.
Majesty.
How do you find this country?
I like it very much.
I could most happily live here.
So, you've met Princess Mary?
It was only for a moment,
but I relive that moment
over and over again in my mind.
I was told before that she was
charming, intelligent,
well-read, gracious.
The true heir of Katherine of Aragon.
A true Princess.
But nothing prepared me
for her beauty.
But a beauty that comes from inside.
To me, she is the most beautiful
creature on God's earth.
The Council has acted upon
Your Majesty's request.
We demanded written evidence
of the Queen's envoy
about the pre-marriage contract
to the Duke of Lorraine's son.
They provided it, but the papers
seem to suggest that,
instead of the usual formula,
"per verba de futuro",
the actual wording
on the document reads
"per verba de presenti",
which is a binding contract
- which renunciation cannot undo.
- So it does seem
that Your Majesty has reason
to be optimistic.
The King has noticed you.
He may ask to see you.
What shall I say to him?
What should I do?
Just be yourself.
Who is that girl?
That is Katherine Howard.
She is a relation
to the Duke of Norfolk.
She has only just come to court.
Bring her to me.
Majesty.
Majesty, Miss Katherine Howard.
Thank you, Charles.
Katherine.
Your Majesty.
Please, be seated here.
- Are you married?
- No, Your Majesty.
Can you read?
- Enough to write a letter.
- Who writes to you?
Nobody.
Do you have many houses?
- Ouch!
- What is it?
You stepped on my foot.
Philip, I'm so very sorry!
I do apologize. I'm so sorry.
Philip, I'm so sorry!
- I thought...
- You didn't step on my foot.
How could you? Your feet
don't even touch the ground.
I wanted a moment alone with you.
I...
You're crying.
Only because I'm so happy.
Would you like me to kiss you again?
Do you know where
this ring comes from?
It once adorned the shrine
of Thomas Becket at Canterbury.
The whole shrine
glittered with jewels,
left by princes and pilgrims.
But this ring...
This ring was the most
valuable gift of all.
A King of France left it
as an offering
to save his mortal soul.
May I touch it?
Good night, Princess.
Good night, Your Grace.
Tell me, Mr. Cromwell,
how is work proceeding
on my palace at Nonsuch?
I am pleased to report
that it is almost complete,
and will be ready for your
personal inspection come July.
I want to give a gift of land
to Mistress Katherine Howard.
There is some we recently
confiscated from a felon
if I remember correctly.
With two large houses upon it?
I wish to grant the whole
to Mistress Howard.
Majesty.
I hear the Council found a flaw
in the Queen's precontract.
It was not such a flaw
that it could not be overcome
by the Queen's personal repudiation.
There must still be grounds.
Before God, I think she is not
my lawful wife.
Whatever people say, Mr. Cromwell,
either to your face
or behind your back,
you are still my first minister,
whose love and loyalty
I have no cause nor reason to doubt.
If there is anything
important to be done,
I know who best to do it.
Majesty.
- Mr. Cromwell!
- Mr. Cromwell, sir!
- Mr. Cromwell!
- Mr. Risley.
- Give it to Mr. Risley
- We're doing our best.
We'll do our best for you.
Very good, very good, very good.
- Mr. Risley! Thank you sir.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- The meeting with the French Ambassador?
- It was...
...very interesting, Your Majesty.
He told me that
the King was not averse to opening
secret negotiations with us,
with a view to disengaging the French
from their alliance with the Emperor.
Good.
The Ambassador also suggested to me
how much Anglo-French
relations would improve
if Lord Cromwell no longer
stood as an obstacle to them.
Mistress Howard?
The King would like
you to accept a gift.
It's lovely.
You must thank His Majesty.
You can thank him yourself.
Your Majesty.
Come.
Bishop Gardiner.
Just the man we needed.
Now, we may begin.
Gregory? What is it?
It's a boy.
It's a boy. I have a son.
Thanks be to God...
Prince Edward, Your Majesty.
My son.
My son.
Gentlemen, I call this council
meeting to order
Cromwell, do not sit there.
That is no place for you.
Traitors do not sit among gentlemen.
My Lord Cromwell,
you are arrested for treason.
I am no traitor.
I ask you, on your consciences,
am I a traitor?
Yes! Traitor! Traitor!
- Traitor! Traitor!
Traitor! Traitor!
Traitor!
I am no traitor!
I am no traitor!
I'm no traitor!
I'm no traitor!
Princess Mary, do sit down.
I have some... some news.
Duke Philip has been
sent back to Bavaria.
Your father, the King,
sent him away. I am so sorry.
I cannot explain.
No need to explain.
It is of little matter.
The Duke was charming
but I would never have married him.
He is a Lutheran
and I am a Catholic.
My lords, I am come here...
to introduce a bill of attainder
against Thomas Cromwell
on a charge of treason.
Lord Cromwell,
whom His Majesty
has raised from a very base
and low degree, and enriched
with manifold gifts,
is proved to be
a most false and corrupt
traitor and deceiver.
Being a detestable heretic,
he has utterly disposed to set
and sow common sedition
among Your Majesty's
loyal and loving subjects.
As the vice-regent for religion
supposed to oversee reform,
Cromwell has, without
His Majesty's knowledge,
licensed heretics
to preach and teach.
My lords,
we have evidence that
on the night of March the 31st,
in the parish of St. Peter the Poor,
Lord Cromwell did arrogantly defend
these heretic preachers.
He said if the King...
should turn against reform,
he would not turn.
And if the King did turn,
and all his followers,
then he would stand fighting
in the field with his sword
in his hand, against the King
and against all his followers.
And he took out
his dagger, and he said,
"Or let this dagger
thrust me to the heart,
"if I would not die
for that quarrel.
"And if I should live a year or two,
"then it will no longer be
in the King's power
any more to resist or hinder
our reformation. "
And he swore a great oath!
Traitor!
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!
Is it true that you loved
this man, Sir Richard?
As a friend.
But I chiefly loved him for
the love I thought I saw him bear
towards the King above all others.
But now, if he be a traitor,
then I am sorry
that I ever loved him
or trusted him,
and I am very glad
that his treason is discovered
in time.
Traitor!
Traitor! Justice!
I trust, Madam,
you are happy and well treated?
I have no complaints whatsoever.
Everywhere I go, I am treated
with great respect
and kindness from everyone.
I'm glad.
You are not eating.
Your Majesty...
I... I wondered...
I am sending you away for a
while, to my palace at Richmond.
For your health,
and for your pleasure.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I have some urgent business
to attend to.
Madam.
The Council considers it sufficient,
as Head of the Church,
that you can have
the bishops annul your union.
But...
it would be more diplomatic
if you should find proof that
the marriage was never consummated
and that Your Majesty never
truly consented to it.
Send a deputation to Mr. Cromwell.
Demand of him written evidence
supporting my annulment.
Doubtless he'll remember
how often I spoke to him
of how my nature
abhors that woman...
Mr. Cromwell.
Your Grace.
The King orders that
you write him a letter,
describing how he found
Anne of Cleves,
what passed between you
on that subject,
and whether he told you
he had consummated
his so-called marriage or not.
He also orders you to describe
the impediments to the marriage,
and whether knowing them
you still arranged it.
His Majesty charges that,
as you will answer God
on the dreadful day of judgment,
and also upon the extreme danger
and damnation of your soul
and conscience,
to write down exactly what you know.
I will most gladly do
as the King commands.
I trust to his pleasure
and satisfaction.
I desire more than anything else
the King's comfort,
and would most willingly die for it.
I wondered if you could see
your house from that window?
The fact is, Mr. Cromwell,
that only two hours
after your arrest
the King dispatched
his Treasurer there
to take away your goods.
The rabble came out
to cheer them on.
It was a pretty sight, I hear.
Guard.
"Finding Your Majesty not as pleased
"as I trusted to have done,
I was so bold
"to ask you how you liked the Queen.
"Your Majesty soberly answered,
"As you know, I liked her
not well before,
"but now I like her much worse.
"I have felt her belly
and her breasts
"and thereby, as I can judge,
"she should be no maid.
I left her as good a maid
as I found her!"
At the end.
What does he say at the end?
"I beseech Your Majesty most humbly
"to pardon my rude writing
and to consider that I,
"a most woeful prisoner,
am ready to take the death,
when it shall please
God and Your Majesty. "
<i>Yet the frail flesh</i> <i>incites me</i>
<i>continually to call</i>
<i>to Your Grace for mercy</i>
<i>and grace for my offences,</i>
<i>and thus Christ save,</i>
<i>preserve, and keep you...</i>
<i>Written at the Tower this Wednesday,</i>
<i>... the last of June with heavy heart
and trembling hand</i>
"of Your Highness' most heavy
and miserable prisoner
and poor slave. "
He's written something
right down at the bottom.
"Most gracious prince,
I cry for mercy, mercy.
Mercy. "
Will Your Grace be
on Tower Hill tomorrow?
Try to keep me away.
I can vouchsafe to Your Grace
his final end will be
the most ignominious ever.
So I have heard, Your Grace.
So I have heard.
What is he talking about?
Tell me.
Cromwell is set to appear
on the same scaffold
as Lord Hungerford...
otherwise known as Mad Walter,
who has been sentenced to death
for various offences
such as sodomy, raping his daughter,
and paying magicians to predict
the date of the King's death.
He won't have to pay them
to predict the date of his own.
Then Cromwell will be humiliated.
The false churl who was
so ambitious for others' blood!
Ah, that is not our only device.
Tom and I have conceived
some more sport
at His Lordship's expense.
What kind of sport?
Patience Edward.
Patience.
Let's have another beer.
Sorry, there; I've forgotten
your name, fellow.
- What is it again?
- Gurrea, sir.
Gurrea. D'you have the pox
or is it gone, 'urrea?
It's a big day tomorrow.
I ought to be abed.
A last pint! I'm paying.
And then let's drink
to old friends, huh?
Two more pints, my good man!
Master Gurrea,
I trust you're feeling
clear-headed this morning.
Madam, the Earl of Hartford is come.
My lords.
Madam, it is my duty to
inform you that Parliament,
the convocations
of Canterbury and York
have found your marriage
to the King to be invalid
on the grounds of your
precontract with Lorraine,
His Majesty's lack of consent
to the marriage,
and its non-consummation.
The marriage is thus declared
null and void,
and from henceforth
it is the King's pleasure
that you call yourself his sister.
Do you consent?
In which case,
I can tell you that the King
has settled upon you
a handsome annuity
of 4,000 pounds per annum,
as well as the manors
of Bletchingly and Richmond,
and also Hever Castle, so long
as you remain in England.
And since His Majesty confirms
that you are still a maid,
you are free to marry
whom you choose.
Please...
tell the King that...
I hope I will sometimes
have the pleasure
of his most noble presence,
and beseech the Almighty to send
him long life
and good health.
Oh, my Lady.
Father!
Good people,
I am come here to die,
and not to purge myself,
as some may think I should.
I am by law condemned to die
and I thank my Lord God
that has granted me
this death for my offence.
For since I came of age
I have lived as a sinner
and offended my Lord God,
for which I ask Him heartily
for forgiveness.
Get it over with! For Christ's
sake, get it over with!
I have also offended my Prince,
for which I ask him hearty amnesty.
I heartily desire you to pray
for the King's Grace
and that he may long live with
you in health and prosperity.
and that after him his son,
Prince Edward,
may long reign over you.
There it is.
Nonsuch Palace.
My Fool told me it didn't exist.
Gentlemen,
you should all take warning from me,
who was, as you know, from
a poor man made by the Prince
into a great gentleman and that I,
I not contented with that,
not with having the kingdom
at my orders,
presumed to a still higher state.
My pride has brought its punishment.
Lord, grant me that when these
eyes shall lose their use,
the eyes of my soul may see Thee.
God Lord and father, that when
this mouth shall lose his use...
Kill him!
... that my heart
will say unto Thee:
Father, into your hands
I commend my spirit.
Come on now!
Take his head off!
Pray for the Prince
and for the Lords of the Council
and for the clergy
and for the people.
Now I beg you again that
you will pray for me.
Pray, if possible, cut off
the head with one blow...
that I may not suffer much.
Chop it off!
Your Majesty.

Dites-moi, Monsieur Marillac :
qu'a dit votre roi

Il n'a pas dit grand-chose.

Voulez-vous danser ?
Allez-y.
Attendez.

Dites à votre maître
que la mort du Dauphin,
son fils aîné, m'a attristé.
Majesté.
Sa Majesté suggère un mariage

Le sujet est récurrent.
Pardonnez.
Vous êtes étranger à cela.
Savez-vous son âge ?
Dix-sept ans.
En avez-vous parlé à votre maître ?
Qu'en dit-il ?
Il doit me croire fou.
Ou bien, il est vraiment jaloux.

pour ma "grande destinée",
et me demande
de la faire venir à la cour.
Elle dit que certaines circonstances
l'ont conduite
à "la plus grande souffrance,
"ainsi qu'à une vie misérable."
Vous allez la faire chercher ?
J'y réfléchirai, Lady Rochford.
Maintenant mesdames,
si vous essayiez
vos nouvelles robes ?
<i>Encore une chose amusante
sur les Français.</i>
Pour célébrer le solstice d'hiver
à Paris,
ils font un feu de joie,
au sommet duquel ils mettent un baril,
une roue, des guirlandes,
un panier plein
de deux douzaines de chats,
et un renard qui seront brûlés vif.
Pour le plaisir du Roi !
J'ai même vu le Roi François
l'allumer avec une torche
enveloppée dans du velours rouge.
Bien sûr !
Après avoir été absent si longtemps,
comment trouvez-vous la cour ?
Je la trouve
pleine de méchantes créatures.
Beaucoup d'entre elles
sont au service de Sa Majesté.
- De qui parlez-vous ?
- De ces hommes de vile naissance :
avocats, hommes d'université,
intrigants machiavéliques,
dont le seul désir
est la destruction
de la noblesse de ce pays.
Et je les déteste... tous.
Vous parlez des Seymour ?
On ne peut pas oublier que la sœur
a donné un héritier au Roi.
Maintenant que vous êtes là,
qu'allez-vous faire ?
Surpasser les faits et gestes
de mon père et mon grand-père.
C'est une haute ambition, My Lord.
Je suis un Howard.
C'est ce qu'on attend de moi.
Depuis toujours.
Et je n'échouerai pas.
- Un cerf ?
- Aucun !
Majesté, vous n'avez pris
que quelques lapins et un cerf,
mais vous souriez.
Pourquoi ne serais-je pas heureux ?
Vous avez vu la Reine.
Tout homme à qui elle s'offrirait
ne serait-il pas toujours heureux ?
Il serait au-delà du bonheur.
Au-dessus de tout.
Je me sens comme un homme nouveau.
Je ne suis plus agacé par les choses
qui m'agaçaient auparavant.
Ma jambe commence même à guérir.
Le sexe est un grand remède.
En effet. Vous êtes très chanceux.
Comment va Catherine ?
Elle va bien,
même si elle ne m'aime plus
comme jadis.
- Nous vivons séparément.
- Prenez une maîtresse.
À choisir,
je préfèrerais qu'elle me revienne.
Je veux présenter la Reine bientôt.
Je veux que les gens la voient
comme moi.
Majesté.
Et son parent, Lord Surrey.
Je veux en faire un échanson,
lui montrer l'estime
qu'on lui porte.
C'est sûr que son Excellence
sera reconnaissante.
Non, My Lord. Il le verra
comme un droit imprescriptible.
Maître Culpepper !
Faites nettoyer cela
et préparer un bon repas.
Oui, Majesté. Rabatteurs !
Majesté. Lady Mary.
Lady Mary.
Madame.
C'est un tel plaisir
de vous rencontrer.
Le Roi parle souvent de vous.
Non, tout le temps,
avec une telle affection...
Mon vœu le plus cher
est que nous nous apportions...
bonté ainsi qu'affection...
et que nous soyons proches.
Après tout, Lady Mary,
vous êtes ma belle-fille.
Je porterai attention
à Votre Majesté
à chaque fois
que Votre Majesté m'invitera.
Merci.
Resterez-vous ?
Mes servantes ont fait des gâteaux.
Non, je vous remercie.
Passez une bonne journée.
Madame.
Votre vieille amie est ici :
Mademoiselle Joan Bulmer.
Katherine !
N'es-tu pas la femme
la plus chanceuse du monde ?
- Joan, je...
- Tu n'es pas ravie de me voir ?
Bien sûr que je le suis.
Nous étions si proches.
Tu sais l'amour sincère
que t'ai toujours porté.
Tu vas me donner une position,
je suppose ?
Je peux.
Mais il faut comprendre...
Autrement,
je végéterai dans ma situation.
Dans ma misère.
Dis que tu ne me renverras pas.
Tu te rappelles
quand vous-savez-qui entrait,
la nuit,
puis se glissait dans ton lit ?
Pour l'amour de Dieu,
attention à ce que tu dis.
Mais tu feras de moi
l'une de tes suivantes ?
Douce Katherine.
My Lords, de nouveaux rapports
parlent de perturbations en France.
Une querelle a éclaté
entre la garnison française de Ardres
et notre garnison de Guisnes.
Les Français
ont construit un château à Ardres,
ainsi qu'un pont dans le Calaisis.
Dès que nos soldats l'ont démoli,
les Français l'ont reconstruit.
Je dois montrer aux Français
que je ne me retirerai pas
d'une bataille où j'ai été provoqué !
C'est pour cela que j'envoie Seymour
et le Comte de Surrey à Calais.
Ils emmèneront la garnison,
des hommes et l'artillerie,
et feront une démonstration de force
devant Ardres.
Que les Français
se décident à renoncer...
ou non.
- Il pleut des roses !
- My Lady.
M. Thomas Culpepper est ici.
M. Culpepper.
Votre Majesté,
le Roi m'envoie.
Venez.
Sa Majesté vous fait savoir
que vous l'escortez pour une visite
du domaine de Sir William Paget
dans le Berkshire,
pour votre plaisir.
Je suis très reconnaissante
envers Sa Majesté
et j'attendrai avec hâte
cette visite.
Sa Majesté vous fait aussi savoir
qu'il a fait préparer
le château de Baynard comme douaire.
Où se trouve ce château ?
Ici à Londres,
sur la rive nord de la Tamise,
près de la Fleet Tower.
Vous avez dû le voir.
Est-il grand ?
Oui il est très grand.
Dans ce cas, dites à Sa Majesté
que je lui suis
très très reconnaissante.
Je ne peux imaginer
posséder un château.
<i>Puis-je recommander à Votre Majesté
de prendre une action décisive</i>
<i>contre les Français,
en honorant mon frère du commandement ?</i>
<i>Sa Majesté désire aussi
que vous acceptiez ce cadeau.</i>
Dites à Sa Majesté que...
Que vous êtes
très, très, très reconnaissante.
Oui.
Je ne sais à qui me confier,
M. Culpepper.
Quand je sors,
et quand j'irai faire cette visite
avec le Roi,
je...
n'ai pas l'habitude que les gens...
... me regardent.
Et parfois...
j'aimerais qu'ils évitent.
Laissez les hommes vous regarder,
car ils vous regarderont.
Vous n'y pouvez rien.
Votre Majesté.
Lady Rochford.
<i>Votre Majesté.</i>
<i>Bonjour, My Lady.</i>
<i>Je vous aime.</i>
<i>Embrassez-moi.</i>
<i>Non !</i>
<i>Embrassez-moi s'il vous plaît.</i>
<i>Bon, d'accord.</i>
<i>Venez ici.</i>
<i>Oh, My Lady ! Oh, ma Reine !</i>
<i>Majesté !</i>
Je vais m'absenter un temps.
M. Risley vous fournira
un itinéraire.
Oui Votre Majesté.
J'ai aussi l'intention de convoquer
le Conseil pendant mon absence.
Les Conseillers devront y être
ou avoir une très bonne raison.
- Majesté.
- Voici mes instructions.
Autre chose :
pendant notre absence je veux commencer
les embellissements du palais.
Il y aura une nouvelle façade
le long de la rivière,
des appartements pour Lady Mary,
et une maison des banquets.
- Maudite chaleur...
- Pardon, Votre Majesté ?
Dites-moi Messire,
qui est actuellement détenu à la Tour ?
Lord Grey,
accusé d'abus de pouvoir en Irlande,
Lord Lisle,
pour la même raison à Calais,
et Sir John Neville qui mena,
Votre Majesté s'en souvient,
les troubles récents dans le nord,
pour lesquels il a été arrêté.
Il y a aussi un autre noble,
le cousin de la Reine, Lord Dacres.
Pour quel crime ?
Votre Majesté, Lord Dacres
est un jeune homme de 23 ans,
qui avec quelques amis,
et après avoir bu,
s'en est pris à un vieil homme
et l'a tué.
Son père et d'autres membres
de sa famille ont écrit à Sa Majesté
vous suppliant de le gracier
en raison de son jeune âge.
Les trois premiers
seront exécutés pendant mon absence.
Lord Dacres est un cas à part.
Il a déshonoré sa lignée
en se comportant en criminel.
Et je veux donc
qu'il soit traité comme tel.
Qu'il soit trainé dans les rues
jusqu'à Tyburn
pour y être pendu en public,
à la vue de tous.
Oui Votre Majesté.
Va-t-il enfin pleuvoir,
pour l'amour de Dieu ?
Lady Hertford,
le Comte de Surrey, Mylady.
Messire.
Que puis je faire pour vous ?
Je pensais voir le Comte ici.
Je pars pour la France.
C'est un dur à cuire.
Je voulais ses conseils.
Mon mari est au conseil avec le Roi.
Une de mes connaissances
m'a parlé de vous,
faisant un tel tableau de vos vertus
et vos talents,
que je voulais faire
votre connaissance.
Je viens de rentrer de France
et je connais intimement
très peu de gens à la Cour.
Eh bien, nous voici présentés.
Si c'est ce que vous vouliez ?
Je dirai à mon mari
que vous souhaitez lui parler.
Merci.
Mylady.
Sir Edward !
Ces souliers doivent être bien rangés
et soigneusement entretenus.
Oui, My Lady.
Votre Majesté, le Roi est là !
Eh bien !
Mon cœur, voici deux personnes
venues se présenter.
- Lady Bryan.
- Votre Majesté.
Voici mon fils, le Prince Edward.
Venez ici mon enfant.
Voici ma nouvelle reine, Katherine.
- Dis-lui bonjour.
- Bonjour, Votre Majesté.
Quel adorable garçon !
Bonjour, votre Grâce.
Je suis ravie de vous rencontrer.
Merci.
Il va bien ? Il mange bien ?
Souffre-t-il de la chaleur ?
Malgré la canicule il doit toujours
être protégé des courants d'air.
Il va bien,
et tous les soins nécessaires
à son confort sont pris.
Cela étant dit,
ne le gâtez pas trop !
Vas-y.
- Et sois sage, tu m'entends ?
- Merci Sire.
Au revoir, Madame.
Bienvenue, Elizabeth.
Voici ma fille, Lady Elizabeth.
Votre Majesté, c'est un honneur
de vous rencontrer
et de vous souhaiter
joie et bonheur.
C'est aussi un honneur
de vous rencontrer, Lady Elizabeth.
Vous êtes
une très jolie jeune demoiselle
Merci, Madame.
Je veux vous offrir ceci.
Ils n'ont guère de valeur,
mais vous feront penser à moi.
Votre Majesté est très généreuse.
Je le chérirai toujours.
Votre Majesté.
Faites vos bagages,
nous partons demain.
Madame.
À nous, M. Risley.
Les arrêts de mort, Lord Hertford.
Lord Grey.
Lord Lisle, Sir John Neville
et Lord Dacres.
J'ai pitié de lui pour son âge.
Il parait que les juges ont pleuré
en lisant sa sentence.
Que Dieu nous protège, M. Risley,
des juges en pleurs.
Messire.
Surrey vous a parlé
avant de partir ?
Non. Depuis son retour le Comte
a dit à tout le monde
qu'il nous considère
comme des parvenus.
Se pourrait-il
qu'il traite avec vous ?
Peut-être.
Pourquoi est-ce important ?
Surrey est héritier d'un grand titre
et d'une grande fortune.
Sa famille est de sang royal.
Même vous pouvez voir l'intérêt
de traiter avec lui.
Sir William ?
La Reine et moi vous remercions
de ce splendide accueil.
Votre Majesté est trop généreuse.
Nous sommes honorés de votre visite
Sir Richard.
Votre Majesté. J'arrive de la Cour.
Des nouvelles de France.
Apparemment, peu après mon arrivée
Sir Thomas Seymour
et Lord Surrey, ont fait
une démonstration de force,
et ensuite des ouvertures
au gouverneur français.
Il y a eu échange de cadeaux
et les Français ont été invités
à regarder de la lutte.
Et depuis, au lieu de ne parler
que de guerre, on ne parle plus
que de vouloir vivre en paix.
Alors, c'est pour le mieux.
Pourtant, Sir Richard,
je me sens déçu.
J'ai faim de guerre.
Je n'ai connu ses joies qu'une fois,
il y a bien longtemps.
C'est drôle, je pensais
que les Français
me feraient plaisir cette fois.
Majesté.
Êtes-vous heureuse ?
Avez-vous tout ce que vous voulez,
tout ce dont vous avez besoin ?
- Dites-moi.
- Oui, tout.
Il y a une chose.
Laquelle ?
Il n'y a que...
Lady Mary
ne me montre pas de respect.
Et je pense
qu'elle devrait me respecter.
Elle le fera. Croyez-moi.
Laissez-lui du temps.
C'est nouveau pour elle,
mais elle s'habituera à vous.
Puis elle vous aimera.
Je l'espère.
Katherine, Katherine.
Je suis fatigué. Très fatigué.
Une dure journée m'attend demain.
Bonne nuit mon amour.
Dormez bien.
Bonne nuit Votre Majesté.
Bonne nuit, My Lady.
Joan !
Qu'y a t-il ?
Ne t'inquiète pas. Je ne reste pas.
J'ai juste envie de parler.
De quoi ?
C'était comme ça, avant.
Toi et moi, ensemble.
Fais attention à ce que tu dis.
Je n'en parle qu'à toi.
Alors, ils entraient tous les deux,
un pour toi, l'autre pour moi.
Et tous ces rires et ces
soupirs dans le noir...
Vous vous embrassiez,
unis l'un à l'autre
comme deux moineaux.
Il n'y avait aucun mal à ça.
C'était entendu.
Nous devions nous marier.
Tu l'as dit au roi ?
Ne sois pas stupide.
Il n'a pas besoin de savoir
ce qui s'est passé avant.
Et si tu en parles à quelqu'un,
je jure que...
Penses-tu
que je n'aime pas être
une personne en vue à la cour ?
Alors jure sur ton honneur
et sur ta vie,
que tu n'en parleras à personne,
pas même aux autres dames d'honneur.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Je le jure.
Honnêtement.
Retourne te coucher.
Te souviens-tu de ceci ?
Je suis une reine.
Fais ce que j'ordonne.
Sir William est fort aimable
- de nous ouvrir sa cave.
- Je pensais, Sir Edward,
- que vous l'aviez ouverte vous-même.
- J'avais soif !
J'ai encore soif !
- Elle est dévergondée.
- Qui donc ?
Vous savez de qui je parle.
La reine Catherine.
C'est une boule de feu.
Trop brûlante pour vous,
M. Culpepper.
Vraiment ?
Osez prétendre
que vous ne l'imaginez pas dévêtue.
Imaginez son corps nu.
Ses seins.
Ses cuisses.
Son joli petit cul rebondi.
Nom de Dieu.
Toutes ces choses
appartiennent au roi.
Bonne nuit, messieurs.
À votre place,
je n'abuserais pas davantage
de l'hospitalité de Sir William.
Je n'arrive pas à boire assez
pour la chasser de mes pensées.
Demain, nous irons chercher
quelque chose
étancher cette soif.
- Holà !
- Bonjour, monsieur.
Bonjour.
- Qui es-tu ?
- La femme du gardien, monsieur.
- Et où est ton mari ?
- À la foire, monsieur.
- Quelqu'un est là ? Tes enfants ?
- Non, monsieur.
J'avais une fille, mais elle est morte.
Il n'y a personne d'autre.
Je peux vous aider ?
Tu peux me rendre un service,
tu y prendras plaisir.
Non, monsieur !
Sais-tu qui je suis ?
Un gentilhomme de la cour.
Je sers le roi.
- Allons à l'intérieur.
- Non !
Si vous êtes un vrai gentilhomme,
vous n'essaierez pas de me forcer.
Vous partirez,
puisque je vous le demande.
Par ici !
Par-derrière !
Par ici, ma poulette !
Allez les gars !
- Laissez-moi !
- Regardez-la courir !
- Tu vas adorer !
- Attrapez-la !
- Allons, doucement.
- Tenez-la.
Qui es-tu ?
M. Roper, monsieur. Le gardien.
M. Roper.
Que diable me voulez-vous ?
Vous savez très bien
ce que je veux, monsieur.
La justice.
Je sais ce que vous avez fait.
Je vous emmène chez le shérif.
- Venez, monsieur.
- Ne me touche pas.
Tu devrais connaître tes maîtres.
Retourne à ta porcherie.
J'irai chercher
le shérif moi-même,
dont la justice
vaut mieux que la vôtre !
N'importunons pas le shérif.
Combien pour ton silence ?
Allons.
Quel mal a été fait ?
Voici une couronne en or
pour acheter une douzaine de porcs
et oublier l'affaire.
Non, monsieur.
La honte serait toujours là
dans les yeux de ma femme.
Et dans mon âme.
Maudit imbécile.
Je dois dire
que votre invitation m'a surpris.
Vraiment ?
J'aurais cru qu'il en fallait bien plus
pour vous surprendre, messire.
Il est vrai que j'ai vu
bien des choses dans ma vie.
Mais les gens
peuvent encore me surprendre.
Je vous ai invité
car je désire que nous soyons amis.
Quel genre d'amis ?
De bons amis.
Qui voudrait être détesté ?
Les gens sont bons
lorsqu'ils ont peur.
Lorsqu'ils n'ont pas peur...
ils peuvent être ce qu'ils veulent.
Je n'ai pas peur.
Je n'aurai jamais peur.
Votre Majesté !
Mes conseillers arrivent.
Je devrais me laver.
Oui.
Messieurs. Messires.
Votre rapport, Lord Hertford ?
Votre Majesté,
la peste s'est déclarée en ville
durant votre absence,
mais elle se termine, grâce à Dieu.
Les travaux ordonnés par Votre Majesté
ont débuté.
Les exécutions de Lord Grey,
Lord Lisle, Sir John Neville
et Lord Dacres ont eu lieu
selon le désir de Votre Majesté.
Assis.
Messires.
Concernant les 500 hommes
emprisonnés pour hérésie,
je désire qu'ils soient
pardonnés et donc libérés.
Votre Majesté
montre une grande charité
Oui ?
Notre Seigneur ne commande-t-il pas
de ne pas oublier
la miséricorde et la foi ?
Comment va mon fils ?
Le prince Edward se porte très bien,
Votre Majesté.
Le roi François a officiellement
proposé un contrat de mariage
entre son fils, Henri, Duc d'Orléans
et Lady Mary.
Nous ne pouvons
croire en ses intentions
quand nous pensons qu'il projette
- d'envahir ce royaume
- Oui.
Les évènements de Calais
n'étaient qu'un test.
Nous devons donc renforcer
nos défenses et favoriser l'empereur.
Maintenant,
concernant la reine Catherine,
Je veux lui attribuer
les terres et les manoirs
qui étaient à Jane Seymour.
De plus, certains domaines et biens
de Thomas Cromwell
lui seront également légués.
Ses emblèmes seront
placés dans tous les palais,
et elle devra désormais
être traitée avec les égards
dus à la reine d'Angleterre.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Écoutez.
Vous entendez ?
Il pleut !
Il pleut !
Où allez-vous ?
Il pleut, Henri !
Il pleut !
<i>Previously on The Tudors.</i>
We are come here
together to join Henry VIII
and the Lady Jane Seymour.
- <i>I think she'll make him happy.</i>
- <i>With God's help,</i>
- <i>we'll all be happy.</i>
- <i>I promise you</i>
that I'll show favor to Lady Mary.
The Lady Mary Tudor.
May I present you to Queen Jane.
<i>Princess Elizabeth.</i>
Je suis en famille!
If the queen favors
the Catholic religion
as she's rumored to do,
our Reformation is in jeopardy.
We must press ahead with
the dissolution of monasteries.
My Lord, we have to tell you
that the North
have risen in sudden rebellion.
We will fight, and we will die!
<i>These wretched men have threatened
my whole realm with uproar!</i>
<i>You told there was opposition,</i>
that people were glad
to see such places dissolved.
You were wrong.
<i>I'll teach these bastard ingrates</i>
a fearful bloody
lesson in slaughter!
Lady Rochford, I'd like to appoint you
my principal lady in waiting.
Madam, the King has taken
Lady Misseldon as a mistress.
Do not be troubled for me for
I have great reason to be happy.
- I think you're with child.
- I am.
<i>I want you to organize
the celebrations for my son.</i>
I want them to be spectacular.
- Madam!
- Is it time?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Please, don't give up!
<i>Your Majesty may have to decide soon</i>
<i>between the life
of the mother or of the child.</i>
Her Majesty is delivered
of a healthy son.
A son.
Right high, right excellent
and noble Prince Edward.
The Queen's health
has rapidly deteriorated.
We've tried everything we know
but Her Majesty continues to weaken.
Please, God,
don't take her away from me.
I wonder if Your Majesty could frame
your mind towards a new marriage.
<i>Enemy ships!
For Lord's sake, light the beacon.</i>
Your Majesty is beset by enemies.
<i>Marriage to Anne of Cleves
would bring with it</i>
<i>the military support
of the Protestant League.</i>
Have I been used as a pawn in a game
between your master
and the French King?
I've had enough, Mr. Chapuys.
Allow me to present my companion,
Mr. Thomas Seymour,
- <i>brother of the Queen.</i>
- Monsieur.
We are threatened from everywhere.
Sharpen your knives.
You don't even know who I am.
<i>You're Edward Seymour's wife.</i>
I thank you, Sir Francis,
in future to leave my wife alone.
I've warned Sir Francis Bryan
to stay away from you.
Well, it's a pity.
He makes me laugh.
<i>Mr. Holbein has sent this portrait
of Anne of Cleves.</i>
<i>She is pleasing.</i>
Sir John has written to me.
I want to possess this woman
and I haven't even seen her.
Many things hang upon this marriage.
<i>What a pity if all should go awry.</i>
I'm deceived about Anne of Cleves.
She's nothing like what was reported!
She looks like a horse!
If it were not to satisfy
the world and my realm,
<i>I would not do what I do
this day for no earthly thing.</i>
It seems to me that Cromwell
has overreached himself.
- <i>I've found someone to amuse the King.</i>
- She is Miss Katherine Howard.
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.
<i>I was sent to live in the household
of the Dowager Duchess.</i>
We ran a little wild.
- What do you think, Your Grace?
- She looks fit for a King.
<i>My Lord Cromwell,
you are arrested for treason.</i>
Traitor! Traitor!
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!
I am no traitor!
As head of Church,
you should find proof
that the marriage
was never consummated.
Send a deputation to Mr. Cromwell.
Demand of him written evidence
<i>supporting my annulment.</i>
<i>Cromwell will be humiliated.</i>
He was so ambitious
for others' blood.
Your Majesty...

<i>I must report to the Emperor
that it has not rained</i>
<i>in over two months.</i>
<i>It is the hottest summer
in living memory,</i>
<i>which is a great inconvenience
to the 500 citizens</i>
<i>the King has incarcerated

<i>His Majesty continues to demonstrate
his perversity,</i>

- Mr. Culpepper.
- Majesty.
- Lady Rochford.
- Majesty.
Katherine.
Will you not come to bed,
My Lord?
The King!
- My Lady.
- Your Majesty.
Who is that talking to Chapuys?
Norfolk's eldest son,
the Earl of Surrey.
The Earl's been away a few years,
practicing his chivalry in France.
They say he writes poetry
and runs a little wild.
Your Grace.
Excellency.
Your Grace seems distracted.
I was thinking of those
who are no longer here
to sup with us.
I had a moment of nostalgia
even for my enemies.
I understand Thomas Boleyn
died recently.
Yes. And the only mourners
at his funeral were the
ghosts of his children.
Ambassador Chapuys.
Monsieur Marillac, we are
happy accept your credentials
from King Francis.
Welcome to our Court.
I come here this day
to introduce to you my new wife,
Queen Katherine.
I was first attracted to her
by a notable appearance of honour,
cleanness...
and maidenly behaviour...
It seems incredible to have obtained
such a perfect jewel of womanhood
who bears towards me
such perfect love.
A love that will not only bring me
the peace and tranquility I desire,
but may also bring forth
the desired fruits
of such a marriage.
- To Queen Katherine.
- Queen Katherine!
Now,
let's eat! I'm starving!
Your Majesty,
may I introduce the Earl of Surrey.
We are glad to welcome you back
my Lord Surrey.
- Allow me to introduce my new wife.
- And my niece, I believe.
My Lord.
Sorry.
Majesty.
So, you are
the new French ambassador.
Tell me, Monsieur Marillac:
what did your King really say
when you told him His Majesty
had got rid of his last Queen?
Well, he didn't say much.
He just sighed very deeply
and then he said: "Ah!"
Would you like to dance?
Go on.
Wait.
Majesty.
Tell your master I was very
sad to hear about the death
of the Dauphin, his eldest son.
Majesty.
His Majesty would like
to propose a marriage
between his second son,
Henri, Duke of Orleans,
and your daughter, the Lady Mary.
How often it comes around.
Forgive me.
You're new to all of this.
Do you know how old she is?
Seventeen.
Have you told your master about her?
What does he say?
I suppose he thinks I'm mad.
Or else he's just plain jealous.
<i> Come here, ladies!
Come and look at this!</i>
The King sent it to me this morning.
Now, ladies...
You must promise that from now on,
as you are all sworn in,
you will all dress
in the French fashion, like me.
- Do you promise?
- Yes, Your Majesty!
We are more than happy
to oblige Your Majesty.
My Lady. You have a letter,
just delivered.
What is it?
Oh, nothing. Just an old friend,
Joan Bulmer.
She has heard of my "great destiny"
and will I please now
send for her to court.
She says that some
altered circumstances
have brought her
"to the utmost misery in the world
and a most wretched life."
Shall you send for her?
I shall think on it, Lady Rochford.
Now, ladies, why don't we
try on your new dresses!
<i>I'll tell you another amusing
thing about the French.</i>
To celebrate the winter
solstice in Paris,
they build a bonfire and on the
top of it they put a barrel,
a wheel, garlands,
and a basket
filled with two dozen cats
and a fox to be burned alive
for the King's pleasure!
I actually saw King Francis himself
light it with a torch
wrapped in red velvet.
Of course!
My Lord Surrey, after so long away,
how do you find the English court?
I find it full of mean creatures.
Many of them
in the service of His Majesty.
- Of whom do you speak?
- Those men of vile birth:
lawyers, university men,
Machiavellian intriguers
whose only desire is the destruction
of the nobility of this country.
And I hate them...
all.
You mean men like the Seymours?
One cannot forget their sister
provided the King with an heir.
And now that you've returned,
what are your ambitions?
To surpass the achievements
of my father and my grandfather.
That is a very high
ambition, my Lord.
I'm a Howard.
It is expected of me.
And always has been.
And I will not fail.
- Any deer?
- No deer!
Majesty, you've caught nothing all day,
beyond some rabbits and a deer,
but you're still smiling.
Have I not every reason to be happy?
You have seen the Queen.
Shouldn't the man that that woman
gives herself to always be happy?
I'd say he'd be beyond happiness.
In a higher state altogether.
I feel almost
like a new man, Charles.
I am no longer vexed by the things
that before vexed me daily.
And even my leg
is beginning to heal.
Sex is a great medicine.
Indeed. You are very fortunate.
How is your Catherine?
She is well, although she no longer
loves me as she once did.
- We live mostly apart.
- Take a mistress.
I would rather make her
love me again, if I could.
I want to take the Queen
on a visit soon.
I want the people
to see her as I see her.
Majesty.
And her kinsman, Lord Surrey.
I want to make him a cupbearer,
and give him other tokens of our esteem.
I am sure His Lordship
will be most grateful.
No, My Lord. He will merely
see it as his birthright!
Master Culpepper!
Come on, boy! Have them
flush us out something edible!
Yes, Majesty. Beaters!
Majesty. The Lady Mary.
Lady Mary.
Madam.
It gives me such pleasure
to meet you.
The King talks about you often,
no, all the time,
with such affection...
It is my dearest wish that you
and I may be...
kind and...
loving and...
warm to each other.
After all, Lady Mary,
you are now my stepdaughter.
I shall attend upon Your Majesty
whenever Your Majesty
chooses to invite me.
Thank you.
Will you stay a while?
My maids have made some cakes.
No, thank you.
I bid you a good day.
Madam.
Your old friend is here:
Miss Joan Bulmer.
Katherine!
Are you not the luckiest,
most fortunate woman in all the world?
- Joan, I-
- Are you not pleased to see me?
Of course I'm pleased.
We used to be so close, didn't we?
You know the unfeigned love my heart
has always borne towards you.
You are going to give me
a position, I presume?
I may. But you must understand-
Otherwise I must persist
in my wretchedness.
In my misery.
Say you will not turn me away.
Do you remember when you know who
used to come in,
late at night and slip into bed?
For God's sake,
be careful what you say.
But you will make me
one of your ladies, won't you?
Sweet Katherine?
My Lords, there are new reports
of disturbances in France. Sit.
There is a quarrel
between the French garrison at Ardres
and our own at Guisnes.
The French built a castle at Ardres
and then a bridge into
the Pale of Calais.
When our soldiers pulled it down,
the French promptly rebuilt it. Now,
I mean to show these French
that I will not shy away
from battle if I am provoked!
For reasons which I am sending Seymour
and the Earl of Surrey to Calais.
They will bring with them
from the garrison, men and ordnance
and they will make a show
of force before Ardres.
In which case the French
must either decide to desist...
or fight.
- It's raining roses!
- My Lady.
Mr... Thomas Culpepper is here.
Mr Culpepper.
Your Majesty, the King has sent me.
Come.
Mr Culpepper?
His Majesty wants you to know that you
will shortly accompany him on a visit
to Sir William Paget's estates
in Berkshire
for your pastime and disport.
I am very grateful to His Majesty
and I look forward
to the visit very much.
His Majesty also wants you to know
that he has settled Baynard's Castle
on you as your jointure.
Where is Baynard's Castle?
It is here in London,
on the north bank of the Thames,
near the Fleet Tower. You've
probably seen it from the river.
Is it that big one?
Yes. It's a very big one.
In that case,
please tell His Majesty
that I am very,
very grateful to him.
I cannot imagine owning a castle.
<i>Majesty, may I commend your Majesty
on taking decisive action</i>
<i>against the French, and for honouring
my brother with a command?</i>
<i>His Majesty also desires you
to accept this gift.</i>
Please tell His Majesty that...
That you're very,
very, very grateful.
Yes.
I do not know who to say this to,
Mr Culpepper.
But,
when I go about,
and when I shall go
with the King on a visit,
I am...
not so used to everyone...
... looking at me.
And sometimes...
wish they would not do.
My Lady, you must give men leave
to look, for they will look upon you.
There is no help for it.
Your Majesty.
Lady Rochford.
<i>Your Majesty.</i>
<i>Hello, my Lady.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>Kiss me.</i>
<i>No!</i>
<i>Please kiss me.</i>
<i>Well, all right then.</i>
<i>Come here.</i>
<i>Oh, my Lady! Oh, my Queen!</i>
<i>Your Majesty!</i>
I'm going away for a while.
Mr. Risley will supply
you with an itinerary.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Also, while I'm away I intend
to call a meeting of the Council.
Every Councillor must attend or give
very good reason why he may not.
- Majesty.
- That's the agenda.
Also,
while we're away I intend for work to
begin on the improvements to the palace.
There will be a new front
along the east river,
privy lodgings for the Lady Mary,
and a banqueting house.
- Damn this heat...
- Pardon, Your Majesty?
Tell me, my Lord,
who is presently kept in the Tower?
There is Lord Grey, accused
of grave misconduct in Ireland;
Lord Lisle, the same but in Calais;
and Sir John Neville who led,
as you may remember, Your Majesty,
the recent disturbance in the north,
for which he has been arraigned.
There is also one other
of high birth,
namely the queen's cousin,
Lord Dacres.
For what crime?
Your Majesty, Lord Dacres
is a young man of 23 years,
who, along with some companions,
and after a drinking bout,
set upon an old man in a brawl
and killed him.
His father and other members of
his family have written to Your Majesty
begging you, for the sake of his youth,
to show mercy.
The first three are to be
executed whilst I'm away.
Lord Dacres is different.
He has besmirched his noble birth
by behaving like a common criminal.
And so I intend he shall be
treated like one.
Have him dragged through the streets
to Tyburn
and there hanged in public,
for all to see.
Yes, Your Majesty.
For God's sakes, will it ever rain?
Lady Hertford,
the Earl of Surrey, my Lady.
My Lord.
How may I be of assistance?
I rather trusted to find
the Earl here.
I am leaving presently for France.
He is a military man.
I wanted some advice.
My husband is in council
with the King.
Someone of my acquaintance
has told me about you,
painting such a picture
of your virtues
and your talents,
that I thought to make
myself known to you.
I am recently returned from France
and I know... intimately
so few people at court.
Well, Sir, now we are introduced.
If that is what you wanted?
I will tell my husband
that you wish to speak to him.
Thank you.
My Lady.
Sir Edward!
These shoes must be nicely put
and always carefully attended.
Yes, my Lady.
Your Majesty, the King is here!
Oh my!
Sweetheart, there are two people
come to be introduced to you.
- Lady Bryan.
- Your Majesty.
This is my son, Prince Edward.
Come forward, child.
This is my new Queen, Katherine.
- Say hello to her.
- Hello, Your Majesty.
Oh, he's such a sweet boy!
Hello, Your Grace.
I am so delighted to meet you.
Thank you.
Is he well? Eating well?
How does the heat affect him?
Even though it is so hot he must always
be wrapped up against any sudden chills.
He is very well and healthy,
and every care that could be taken
is taken for his better comfort.
On the other hand,
don't spoil him too much!
Go on.
- And be a good boy, do you hear?
- Thank you, sir.
Good day, Madam.
Welcome, Elizabeth.
This is my daughter,
the Lady Elizabeth.
Your Majesty, I am honoured
to be presented to you
and wish you every
joy and happiness.
It is also an honour for me
to meet you, Lady Elizabeth.
You are a very pretty young lady.
Thank you, Madam.
I want to give you these.
They are of not much value,
but will remind you of me.
Your Majesty is very generous.
I will always cherish it.
Your Majesty.
Carry on packing;
we depart tomorrow.
Madam.
Now, Mr. Risley.
The death warrants,
my Lord Hertford.
Lord Grey.
Lord Lisle. Sir John Neville.
And Lord Dacres.
I pity him for his youth.
They say the judges wept
when they read his sentence.
God save us, Mr Risley,
from weeping judges.
My Lord.
Did Surrey speak to
you before he left?
No. Since his return the Earl
has made it plain to all who will listen
that he despises us as "new men."
I don't suppose that
he would deal with you?
Perhaps.
Why is it so important?
Surrey is heir to a great
title and a great fortune.
His family have royal blood.
Surely even you can see
the merits of dealing with him.
Sir William?
The Queen and I thank you
for your most lavish hospitality.
Your Majesty is most gracious.
We are so honoured that you and
your Queen have chosen to visit us.
Sir Richard.
Your Majesty, I just came from court.
We've had news from France.
Apparently, soon after I arrived,
Sir Thomas Seymour and Lord Surrey,
as you commanded, made warlike
preparations and showed their strength,
and afterwards made overtures
to the French governor.
Some gifts were exchanged and the French
were invited to watch a wrestling match.
And where, until recently, nothing
but war had been talked of.
Now, there is no mention
but of wishing to live at peace.
Then it was all well done.
And yet, Sir Richard,
something inside me is disappointed.
It hungers for a war.
I have known its mad
excitements only once,
that was a long time ago.
Funny.
You know, I actually thought
the French might oblige me this time.
Majesty.
Are you happy?
Do you have everything you want,
everything you need?
Tell me.
Yes, everything.
There is one thing.
What is it?
It's just that...
the Lady Mary doesn't
treat me with respect.
And I think she ought to, don't you?
She will. Believe me.
Give her time.
All this is new to her,
but she will grow used to you.
And then she will love you.
I hope so.
I'm tired. I'm very tired.
I have a long day tomorrow.
Good night, sweetheart.
Sleep well.
Good night, Your Majesty.
Good night, my Lady.
Joan!
- What is it?
- Don't worry. I won't stay.
I just want to talk.
About what?
This is how it used to be, remember?
You and me together.
I told you to mind what you say.
I'm only talking to you.
And then, the two of them
would come in,
the one for you, and the other mine.
And all that puffing
and blowing in the dark.
And you and him would kiss and hang
by your bellies like two sparrows.
There was no harm in it.
We were agreed
we were to be married.
Is that what you told the King?
Don't be stupid.
I don't need to tell him
anything about...
what happened before.
And if you talk of it to anyone
- I swear I'll...
- Hush. Hush.
Do you suppose I don't like being
at court, like a special person?
Then swear on your honour,
and hope to die,
that you will speak of it to nobody,
not even any of my other ladies.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I do so swear.
Honestly.
Good.
Now go back to bed.
And do you remember this?
I am Queen now.
Do as I command.
How very obliging of Sir William
to open his cellar for us.
I rather thought, Sir Edward,
that it was you who opened it.
Well, I was thirsty!
I still am!
By God she's wanton.
Who is?
You know very well who I mean.
Queen Katherine.
She's a little fireball.
Too hot for you, Mr. Culpepper.
Really?
Tell me you can't imagine her
without her clothes on.
Just picture her naked body.
Those breasts.
Those thighs.
That sweet plump little arse.
Holy Jesus.
All those things belong to the King.
I bid you gentlemen good night.
And if I were you,
I would not outstay your welcome
in Sir William's kitchen.
I can't drink enough
to banish the thoughts of her.
Tomorrow let's go out
and find something
to quench that thirst.
- Ho there!
- Sir, a good day.
And to you. And who are you?
The wife of the park-keeper, sir.
- And where is your husband?
- He's away at a fair, sir.
- Anyone else here? Your children?
- No, sir.
I had a daughter, sir, but she died.
There's no one else here.
Can I help you, sir?
You can do me a great favour,
and it will please you too.
Oh no, sir!
Do you know who I am?
A gentleman of the Privy Chamber.
I serve the King.
- Now, let's go inside.
- No!
If, as you say, you are a gentleman,
then you would not try
to force me against my will.
You would just leave,
as I ask you to.
Come on!
This way! Around back!
Come on, little chicken!
Come on, boys!
Leave me alone!
Look at her run!
You'll enjoy it!
Take her!
Come on now. Easy.
Hold her still.
Who are you, there?
Mr. Roper, sir. The park-keeper.
Mr. Roper.
What on earth do you want with me?
You know very well what I want, sir.
I want justice.
I know what you've done.
I have come to take
you to the Sheriff.
- Come, sir.
- Don't you dare touch me.
You should know your betters.
Now go back to your pigsty.
I will go, sir,
and fetch the Sheriff myself,
whose justice is better than yours!
I would rather not
trouble the Sheriff.
How much do you want
for your silence?
Come on, man.
What real harm was done?
Take a gold crown,
enough to buy a dozen pigs,
and forget the whole matter.
No, sir.
For the shame would still be there
in my wife's eyes.
And in my soul.
Damn you for a fool.
I have to say I was surprised
at your invitation.
Really?
I had imagined that very little
would surprise you, my Lord.
It is true that I have seen
most things in my life.
But I find that people
can always be surprising.
I invited you here because
I want us to be friends.
What kind of friends?
Good friends.
Who wants to be cursed?
People are good
when they are afraid.
When they are not afraid...
they can be anything.
I am not afraid.
I will never be afraid.
Katherine Howard!
Your Majesty!
My Councillors are arriving.
Then I'd better wash.
Yes.
Gentlemen. My Lords.
What is your report,
my Lord Hertford?
Your Majesty, there was a small
outbreak of plague in the city
during your absence,
which now has abated, thank God.
The building works Your Majesty
requested have all commenced.
The executions of Lords Grey and Lisle,
of Sir John Neville and Lord Dacres
have all been carried out in accordance
with Your Majesty's wishes.
Sit.
My Lords.
I refer to the 500 men kept in prison
on suspicion of heresy.
It is my desire that they should be
pardoned and therefore released.
Your Majesty shows
remarkable charity.
Why should I not?
Does our Lord not commend us
to never to let mercy and faithfulness
depart from us?
How is my boy?
Prince Edward is very well,
Your Majesty.
King Francis
has formally proposed
a marriage contract between his son,
Henri, Duc of Orleans,
and Lady Mary.
We do not, and cannot
trust the intentions of King Francis
and still think he means
to invade this realm.
Events at Calais were{\ just} a preliminary
exercise to test our resolve.
In which case we must continue
to look to our defences
and favour the Emperor.
Now, to the subject
of Queen Katherine.
It is my intention to settle upon her
all the lands and manors
which formerly belonged
to Jane Seymour.
Furthermore, some lands and properties
formerly in the possession
of Thomas Cromwell
are also to be settled upon her.
Her badges and emblems
are to be set up in all palaces,
replacing all others, and henceforth
she is in all ways to be treated
as the Queen of England.
Hush!
What is it?
Listen.
Can you hear that?
It's...
It's raining!
It's raining!
Katherine, where are you going?
It's raining! Henry!
<i>Précédemment...</i>
<i>On m'a menti sur Anne de Clèves.</i>
J'aurais su ce que je sais maintenant,
elle ne serait jamais venue ici.
Je dois vous informer
que le Parlement
considère votre mariage
avec le roi invalide.
<i>Messieurs et Mesdames,</i>
je viens vous présenter
ma nouvelle épouse,
la reine Katherine.
Je me sens un homme nouveau.
<i>En s'offrant à lui, elle rendrait
un homme toujours heureux.</i>
Le sexe est un grand remède.
Je ne sais à qui me confier,
M. Culpepper.
Je n'ai pas l'habitude
que tout le monde me regarde.
My Lady, les hommes vous regardent.
Vous n'y pouvez rien.
Comment trouvez-vous la Cour ?
Pleine d'hommes de vile naissance.
Sa famille est de sang royal.
Même vous pouvez voir l'intérêt
de traiter avec lui.
Je vous ai invité
pour que nous devenions amis.
Amis ?
Lady Mary,
mon vœu le plus cher est
que nous soyons proches.
Après tout, vous êtes
ma belle-fille maintenant.
Votre vieille amie est ici,
Mademoiselle Joan Bulmer.
Te rappelles-tu quand
tu-sais-qui venait
la nuit se glisser dans ton lit ?
Pour l'amour de Dieu,
attention à ce que tu dis !
C'est une boule de feu.
- Trop brûlante pour vous.
- Vraiment ?
Imaginez son corps nu, ses seins,
ses cuisses, son joli petit cul.
Tout appartient au Roi.

Comme Sa Majesté doit être heureuse,
Lady Rochford.
Il me semble qu'elle ne fait
que danser et se réjouir !
Elle a de bonnes raisons
d'être heureuse, M. Culpepper.
Le Roi la gâte.
Il lui achète presque chaque jour
des robes ou des bijoux.
Rien n'est trop beau pour elle !
J'imagine que le Roi aussi
est comblé ?
Sa Majesté semble
être un nouvel homme.
Il se lève entre 5 et 6 heures,
assiste à la messe à 7 heures,
sort chasser tôt,
revient dîner à 10 heures,
s'occupe du royaume l'après-midi.
Cette nouvelle règle de vie
doit le garder vif
si vous me comprenez.
Il en aura besoin
s'il veut la satisfaire.
Elle est très...
séduisante.
C'est une folle, M. Culpepper.
Une adorable... petite folle !
Et vous, Lady Rochford ?
George Boleyn est mort
depuis quelque temps.
Vous n'êtes pas remariée ?
Non.
Le duc de Suffolk, Votre Majesté.
Je veux vous montrer quelque chose.
J'ai fait frapper une médaille
pour commémorer mon mariage.
"<i>Henricus VIII :</i>
"<i>Rutilands rosa sine spina</i>."
"Ma rose sans épine."
Dites-moi,
comment va Anne de Clèves ?
Elle s'est établie dans son domaine
et se montre reconnaissante
de la générosité de Votre Majesté.
Je sais également
qu'elle a maintenu ses relations
avec les filles de Votre Majesté
et les convie souvent à dîner.
- Risley.
- Majesté.
Nous écrirons à Lady Anne
pour l'en remercier,
et l'assurer qu'ainsi,
elle trouvera en nous
un véritable ami,
la reconnaissant
comme une très chère sœur.
Majesté.
La duchesse
t'aime-t-elle davantage ?
Elle le semble...
pour sauver les apparences.
Comment puis-je t'aider ?
Quand elle consentira
à me refaire l'amour,
frappez une médaille.
My Lady.
Lord Surrey.
Je préfèrerais l'entendre de vous.
Quoi ?
Lors de notre souper,
vous m'avez donné à croire que...
M. Culpepper.
Votre Majesté.
Que je quoi, My Lord ?
Que vous m'obligeriez
et satisferiez mon désir.
Je suis désolée de vous avoir donné
cette impression.
Ce n'était pas mon intention.
Couchez avec moi.
Ne savez-vous pas qui je suis ?
Je le sais, bien sûr.
Et vous savez qui est mon mari.
Absolument.
C'est un Seymour.
Une famille de loups.
Nous sommes des lions.
Pardonnez-moi...
de viser si bas.
My Lord, Sa Majesté veut vous voir.
Le Comte d'Hertford, Votre Majesté.
J'aimerais aller danser
comme vous tous !
Quand j'entends la musique,
j'ai l'impression
que personne ne fait attention.
Occupez-vous-en !
Autrefois quelqu'un s'en occupait !
Il est mort désormais.
Comment va mon fils ?
Le Prince Edward va très bien.
Il est fort et en bonne santé.
- La fierté de son père.
- Dieu merci.
Il sera bientôt suivi
d'autres princes.
Je vous octroie une nouvelle charge.
Je vous nomme
Lieutenant Général du Nord.
Il y a trop d'incursions
entre l'Écosse et l'Angleterre.
Vous traiterez avec mon cousin,
le roi d'Écosse,
et arrêterez ces incursions.
S'il ne les arrête pas,
vous avez notre permission
de harceler
et persécuter les gens
de l'autre côté de la frontière
avec autant de force
que vous le croirez nécessaire.
Je comprends.
Nous rencontrerons, l'heure venue,
notre cousin, le roi James.
Il n'est pas aussi stupide
qu'il en a l'air. Pour l'instant,
assurez-vous que les Écossais
cessent leurs...
impertinences.
Katherine !
Seigneur !
Baise-moi !
Baise-moi...
- Katherine !
- Oh oui... Oh oui...
Seigneur...
Baise-moi...
Continuez. Allez plus loin.
Je lui ai promis de me taire.
Chère Joan,
parlez.
Je suis responsable
des faits et gestes de la Reine.
Je dois donc tout savoir.
De façon à la protéger.
Alors, quand vous viviez à Lambeth,
sous la protection de la Duchesse,
que s'est-il passé ?
Il y avait deux galants.
Ils s'appelaient Frances Dereham
et Edward Waldegrave,
c'était un gentilhomme
au service de la Duchesse.
Peu importe.
Ils ont trouvé un moyen
de nous appeler secrètement, la nuit,
Katherine et moi.
Ils venaient dans nos lits
toutes les nuits.
Vous avec Waldegrave,
et Katherine avec Francis Dereham ?
Oui. Ça se passait comme ça.
Que vous faisaient
ces gentilshommes ?
Personne n'a rien dit ?
Ça n'a pas été découvert ?
Eh bien,
si Dereham a agi avec elle
comme si c'était son épouse,
c'est qu'elle
se croyait déjà fiancée à lui.
Comme sa promise.
Ça a duré comme ça un long moment.
Vous n'en parlerez à personne ?
Vous ne direz rien ?
Elle m'a fait jurer.
Non, je ne dirai rien.
<i>Bonjour ! C'est une belle journée !</i>
<i>Allez ! Dégagez de mon chemin !</i>
<i>Que regardez-vous ?</i>
<i>Attendez !</i>
<i>Hors de ma vue, sale catin !</i>
Au nom de Dieu, que faites-vous ?
Vous n'avez jamais vu
de vraie femme ?
Que regardes-tu ?
Joli coup My Lord, joli coup !
Dégagez !
Le Comte de Surrey a été emprisonné
pour désordre public, Votre Majesté.
Il maintient
qu'il est le fléau de Dieu ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Et il appelle Londres
"la putain effrontée" ?
Oui. En effet.
Et pour la viande durant le carême ?
Il a dit avoir un permis
pour en manger. Mais...
Mais quoi ?
L'évêque Gardiner
soupçonne My Lord Surrey
d'obtenir sa viande au marché noir,
par des bouchers évangélistes,
d'Honey Lane,
près de l'église d'All Hallows.
Cette même église, Votre Majesté,
est soupçonnée par certains
de prêche secrète
et d'exposition hérétique luthérienne,
de délibérément violer les lois
sur le carême.
Je n'aurais jamais cru
que Surrey était un hérétique.
Son père est proche d'un papiste
bien que devant moi,
il fasse semblant
Sa Grâce et moi serions enclins
avec la permission de Votre Majesté...
à examiner le Comte de plus près,
sur ces questions fondamentales.
En le torturant ?
Non.
Relâchez-le... à l'instant.
Majesté.
Nous devrions préparer le Nouvel An.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Je voudrais inviter Lady Mary
à la cour.
Je voudrais aussi inviter
Anne de Clèves,
pour les fêtes du Nouvel An.
My Lady, voici vos cadeaux
envoyés par le Roi.
Des cadeaux !
C'est si beau.
Regardez !
- Ça brille !
- Sentez !
Ça sent la rose ! Charmant.
C'est parfait !
My Lady ! Regardez !
Oh mon Dieu !
Sa Majesté vous gâte !
Je le sais !
Je le vaux bien.
Touchez ça, c'est si doux.
Je suis la Reine d'Angleterre.
Oh l'or ! J'aime l'or !
Ça va avec ma robe.
- Joyeux Noël, Mesdames.
- Joyeux Noël, Votre Majesté.
- Où allons-nous ?
- Il y a d'autres cadeaux.
Encore !
Qu'en dites-vous ?
Ils sont magnifiques.
Ils ont été offerts
par Anne de Clèves.
Elle arrive demain.
Anne de Clèves ?
Oui, je l'ai invitée
pour le Nouvel An.
Ça ne vous dérange pas ?
Bien sûr que non.
Que Votre Majesté
fasse comme bon lui semble.
Mais...
Vais-je l'apprécier,
cette Anne de Clèves ?
Vous verrez bien.
Reste calme.
J'espère
que Lady Mary sera plus aimable.
<i>My Lords, Lady Mary.</i>
Votre Majesté.
Ma magnifique fille.
Saluez la Reine.
Madame.
Lady Mary. Je suis très heureuse
de votre retour à la cour.
Merci pour mes cadeaux. Votre Majesté
s'est encore montrée très généreuse.
Charles.
Lady Anne.
Votre Grâce.
Je me souviens que vous m'avez appris
à jouer aux cartes.
Je vous suis reconnaissante.
Suite à vos cours,
j'ai gagné une fortune !
My Lords,
Lady Anne de Clèves !
Lady Anne.
Bienvenue à ma cour.
Votre Majesté ! Joyeux Noël.
Permettez-moi de vous présenter
ma nouvelle épouse,
- la Reine Katherine.
- Lady Anne.
Votre Majesté.
Quels grands privilège
et honneur de vous être présentée.
Je suis enchantée.
Vous êtes la bienvenue à la cour,
Lady Anne.
Nous vous remercions
pour l'envoi des chevaux,
et nous vous souhaitons
une heureuse nouvelle année.
Merci, Votre Majesté.
Je pense
que nous devrions tous être heureux !
Oui !
Ladies. Excellence.
Ça ne va pas ?
Ces derniers temps,
je souffre de goutte, Lady Mary.
- Asseyez-vous
- Merci.
Vous avez toujours été
mon plus fidèle
et vrai ami dans ce monde.
Je ne supporterais pas votre départ.
Il n'aurait pas dû divorcer
de Lady Anne.
Je la connais mieux,
et je la trouve parfaite,
douce et gracieuse.
Néanmoins, Lady Mary,
vous allez devoir vous réconcilier
avec la nouvelle Reine.
Certainement pas. Je la déteste.
Alors peut-être
qu'après tout,
vous n'avez plus besoin de mes conseils.
My Lady, avez-vous des nouvelles
de mon frère Edward ?
Il va bien.
Il fait froid mais ça va.
Il fait humide, mais ça va.
Apparemment, il pleut toujours
au nord, et la boue y est abondante.
Aura-t-il un peu d'action ?
Il veut punir les Écossais
pour leur comportement.
Ça ressemble à mon frère.
Si seulement vous pouviez être
comme lui, Sir Thomas.
Que voulez-vous dire ?
Mon mari obtient toujours
ce qu'il veut.
Mesdames, veuillez m'excuser.
Je suis parti chasser tôt
ce matin et je suis très fatigué.
Nous dînerons ensemble demain soir.
- Lady Anne.
- Votre Majesté.
Ma belle épouse.
J'insiste pour que vous
restiez pour la danse.
Petit.
Petit !
Lady Mary !
Je vous souhaite à tous bonne nuit.
Bonne année !
Bonne année, Votre Majesté.
Voudriez-vous
un peu plus de vin Lady Anne ?
Avec plaisir,
si Votre Majesté en prend aussi.
Du vin, oui.
- Votre Majesté.
- Merci !
Lady Anne.
Sa Majesté me dit que sa fille,
Lady Elizabeth,
vient parfois vous voir.
Que pensez-vous d'elle ?
Elle est charmante.
Si intelligente. Et si belle.
Et si affectueuse.
C'est un plaisir de la voir.
Voyez-vous,
je ne souhaite pas me remarier,
je suis donc sûre
de ne pas avoir d'enfants.
Je considère un peu Elizabeth
comme ma fille.
C'est vrai.
L'avoir eue comme fille aurait été
un plus grand bonheur
que d'être Reine.
Bon Dieu !
Ça va mieux.
Puis-je vous poser
une question, Majesté ?
Faites.
Pourquoi avoir invité
Anne de Clèves pour Noël ?
Je l'apprécie, malgré tout.
Elle tient ses promesses, petit.
Majesté ? Venez !
Alors...
Que vous a dit cette Joan Bulmer ?
Elle a dit que...
les nuits où Dereham
visitait le lit de Katherine,
il apportait du vin,
des fraises, des pommes,
et...
d'autres choses pour faire la fête.
Ensuite ?
Ensuite...
Ensuite quoi ?
Ils s'embrassaient
et...
il baissait ses chausses
et couchait avec elle.
Et ils se collaient
ventre contre ventre
comme deux tourtereaux.
Venez.
"Ils se collaient ventre contre ventre
comme deux tourtereaux."
Pourquoi êtes-vous ici ?
Pour prendre ce que je veux,
comme le fait mon frère.
Comme il l'a toujours fait.
Et si je n'en veux pas ?
Et si j'appelle mes servantes ?
Vous ne le ferez pas.
Savez-vous pourquoi ?
Parce que vous haïssez mon frère.
Vous le haïssez
presque autant que moi
mais vous ne pouvez
le dire à personne
sauf à moi.
Eh bien,
M. Seymour,
venez dans mon lit.
Profitez donc
de ce dont votre frère profite.
Il sera intéressant
de vous comparer.

<i>Patris omnipotentum.</i>
My Lady ! My Lady !
La Reine est là !
Majesté.
Lady Mary, je suis venue
en personne vous demander
pourquoi ne me montrez-vous pas
en tant que Reine, le respect
que j'attends, même de votre part.
J'ai remarqué comme tout le monde,
que vous montriez le plus grand respect
à Lady Anne,
alors qu'elle n'est plus
qu'une personne comme les autres.
Excusez-moi, mais
Lady Anne ne mérite-t-elle
pas le respect ?
Elle se comporte
avec beaucoup de dignité
et de modestie,
et ne désire rien d'autre
que de plaire au Roi.
Dites-vous que moi,
je n'essaie pas ?
Je pense que vous ne désirez
rien d'autre que le plaisir !
Rien ne vous plaît à part
vos parures et la danse.
Certains trouveront cela frivole
de la part de l'épouse du Roi,
qui est sacrée.
Si Sa Majesté me trouve
si frivole, pourquoi m'épouser ?
On vous pense
capable de lui donner des fils.
Malheureusement,
malgré les attentions du Roi,
vous n'êtes toujours pas enceinte.
De toute façon,
il se lassera de vous.
Vous verrez.
Et vous ?
Et moi quoi ?
Vous êtes jalouse.
Vous êtes jalouse
car vous êtes mon aînée
et toujours pas mariée.
Peut-être ne le serez-vous jamais,
et finirez-vous vieille fille !
Comment osez-vous me parler ainsi ?
Parce que je le peux.
Et je peux faire ceci, moi aussi.
Pour punir votre manque de respect
envers l'épouse de Sa Majesté,
je vous retire deux domestiques.
Bonne journée, Lady Mary.
À l'amour.
À Katherine,
Reine d'Angleterre.
Et si Dieu le veut, puissiez-vous
être enceinte bientôt.
Merci.
À vous deux.
Vous êtes si gentille, Lady Anne
et mon doux seigneur.
Je suis plus heureuse
que je ne l'ai jamais été
de toute ma vie.
J'ai un cadeau.
Oh mon Dieu !
Puis-je le voir, Majesté ?
Oh, qu'est-ce ?
Encore des cadeaux ?!
Les aimez-vous ?
Je les adore, tout simplement.
Ils sont si beaux.
Mais...
Mais ?
Avec votre permission, Majesté,
J'aimerais partager
ces cadeaux avec Lady Anne.
Moi ?
Oh non !
Puis-je ?
Bien sûr.
Merci !
Adorables !
Ils sont à vous.
- Merci, Katherine !
- Bonne année, Lady Anne,
Coucou !
Coucou.
N'est-il pas chou ?
Lady Mary !
Que faites-vous ?
Je retourne à Hunsdon.
Avec la permission de Sa Majesté ?
Pouquoi partez-vous ?
Vous ne savez pas ?
Elle a congédié
deux de mes domestiques !
La Reine ?
Il paraît
que je ne la respecte pas assez.
Madame, s'il vous plaît.
Je suis sûr que si vous trouviez
moyen d'être conciliante avec elle,
les domestiques resteraient...
Non ! Pourquoi le ferais-je ?
Je ne veux pas être conciliante.
Que vous a-t-elle dit ?
Elle a dit...
que je la jalouse.
Car elle est...
mariée
et moi non.
Peut-être à jamais.
Elle n'aurait pas dû parler ainsi.
Non, mais...
c'est vrai !
C'est vrai !
Ma tendre Lady.
Ma pauvre et tendre Lady.
Lady Rochford.
Comment va le roi, M. Culpepper ?
Très bien, Votre Majesté.
Il vous transmet son amour
et s'enquiert de votre bien-être.
Je n'ai pu monter à cheval
car il pleuvait.
J'en suis navré.
Sa Majesté vous informe
que la campagne contre les Écossais
a été un succès.
Elle est ravie de la façon
dont Lord Hertford
s'est illustré au champ.
Quel champ ?
Le champ de bataille.
Je suis heureuse.
Heureuse ?
Qu'ils aient réussi.
Au champ de bataille.
Y a-t-il autre chose,
M. Culpepper ?
Oui, oui.
Ce livre.
Il a été écrit par Richard Jonas,
venu ici avec Anne de Clèves.
Il comptait le lui dédicacer.
Il souhaiterait à présent
le dédier à Votre Majesté.
Qu'est-ce ? Donnez.
"La naissance... de... l'Humanité" ?
C'est le premier ouvrage en anglais
sur l'art des sages-femmes.
Leur art ?
M. Jonas désire le dédicacer
à la plus gracieuse,
généreuse, excellente
et vertueuse dame.
Quel effet cela ferait-il ?
Quoi donc ?
Je devrais lui apporter du vin,
des pommes et des fraises,
même si ce n'est plus de saison.
De qui parlez-vous ?
À votre avis ?
Unis l'un à l'autre
comme deux tourtereaux !
- Vous le voulez vraiment ?
- Quoi ?
Si c'est le cas,
je peux l'arranger.
Messire.
- Dieu soit loué !
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
Approchez !
Est-ce grave ?
Votre Grâce, la plaie s'est, hélas,
à nouveau ulcérée.
Nous devons la vider du pus
qui s'y est accumulé.
Sinon... la vie de Sa Majesté
est en danger !
Pardon, Majesté.
Cela est pire qu'avant, votre Grâce.
Et si le roi venait à mourir ?
Priez le ciel que cela n'arrive pas.
Il semble mourant.
J'en ai bien peur.
Messires,
je ne suis pas du tout satisfait.
Je m'en suis remis à vous
pour me conseiller
et vous avez trahi ma confiance.
Je vous ai accordé mes faveurs.
J'ai à présent
une triste opinion de vous.
Vous êtes des menteurs,
des flatteurs,
ne servant que votre propre intérêt.
Je sais ce que vous complotez.
Si Dieu me donne la force,
je veillerai à ce qu'aucun
de vos projets ne réussisse !
Je pleure Cromwell.
Oui !
Je le pleure.
Je le pleure
quand je vois que mes conseillers,
sous de futiles prétextes
et fausses accusations,
m'ont amené à condamner
mon plus fidèle serviteur.
Culpepper.
Votre Majesté, M. Culpepper est là.
Seigneur ! Puis-je voir Sa Majesté ?
Pardon, My Lady,
mais Sa Majesté est souffrante.
Elle vous envoie
ce gage d'amour.
Je remercie Sa Majesté, mais...
Cela fait dix jours
que je ne suis pas autorisée à le voir.
Ne veut-il pas me voir ? Pourquoi ?
L'ai-je offensé ? Qu'ai-je fait ?
Il ne doit pas m'aimer vraiment
puisqu'il me délaisse ainsi !
Il a peut-être une maîtresse !
A-t-il une maîtresse, M. Culpepper ?
Est-ce la raison ?
Je ne peux répondre, Majesté.
Est-il avec sa maîtresse ?
Très bien. Partez,
puisque vous ne dites rien,
même si vous voyez
combien je suis malheureuse !
Vous savez
que je ferais l'impossible,
l'impossible...
Pour vous consoler
et vous rendre heureuse.
Plus que tout autre femme,
vous le méritez.
M. Culpepper est beau garçon.
Il est amoureux de vous.
Amoureux ?
Oui.
Il m'a tout avoué.
Il vous aime passionnément.
Il me l'a dit.
Il mourrait pour vous !
Vous êtes dans ses pensées
nuit et jour.
Surrey a écrit un poème
- qui circule à la cour.
- Sur nous ?
Que dit-il ?
Il vous appelle la femme-louve.
Bien sûr, il est le lion.
Vous voulez le piéger,
mais le lion est trop noble
pour se prendre à vos ruses !
Il vous avertit
que si vous le contrariez,
il vous dévorera
comme vous comptiez le dévorer.
Il dit que nous nous sommes élevés
en tuant des innocents !
<i>Vous savez
que je ferais l'impossible,</i>
<i>l'impossible...</i>
<i>pour vous rendre heureuse.</i>
<i>Plus que tout autre femme,
vous le méritez.</i>
Il veut vous voir.
En privé.
Qui ?
Culpepper.
Ce n'est pas possible !
Bien sûr que si.
Comme cet homme
qui vous rejoignait la nuit.
Vous êtes au courant ?
Bien sûr.
Joan Bulmer me l'a dit.
Il pourrait en être ainsi.
Un secret.
Personne ne doit savoir...
ni le roi,
ni personne.
Êtes-vous sûre ?
Venez !
Venez !
<i>Previously on The Tudors</i>
<i>I've been deceived
about Anne of Cleves.</i>
If I had known what I know now,
she would never have been brought here.
It is my duty to inform you
that Parliament
have found your marriage
to the King to be invalid.
<i>Gentlemen and Ladies of the Court,</i>
I come here this day
to present to you my new wife,
Queen Katherine.
I feel almost like a new man.
Should the man that woman
gives herself to, always be happy?
Sex, Charles, is a great medicine.
I do not know who to say this to,
Mr. Culpepper.
I am not so used to everyone
looking at me.
My Lady, you must give men
leave to look...
There is no help for it.
My Lord Surrey,
how do you find the English Court?
I find it full of men of vile birth.
His family have royal blood.
Surely even you can see
the merits of dealing with him!
I invited you here
because I wanted to be friends.
What kind of friends?
Lady Mary,
it is my dearest wish that you and I
may be warm to each other.
After all, you are
now my stepdaughter.
Your old friend is here,
Miss Joan Bulmer.
Do you remember when
you-know-who used to come in?
Late at night, and slip into bed?
For God's sake,
be careful what you say!
She's a little fireball.
- Too hot for you, Mr. Culpepper.
- Really?
Just picture her naked body,
those breasts,
those thighs,
that sweet little arse.
All those things belong to the King.

How happy Her Majesty must be,
Lady Rochford.
It seems to me she does
nothing but dance and rejoice!
She has every reason
to be happy, Mr. Culpepper.
The King spoils her.
Almost every day he buys her
new dresses or jewels.
It seems he cannot
treat her well enough!
I presume the King
is also very happy?
His Majesty seems like a new man.
He rises between 5 and 6 am,
attends Mass at 7,
rides out early to hunt,
comes back at 10 for dinner,
attends to business
in the afternoon.
I think his new rule of living
is intended to keep him fit
if you understand me.
I suppose he would needs be fit,
if he wants to satisfy her.
She is very...
appealing.
She's just a fool, Mr. Culpepper.
A sweet... little fool!
How about you, Lady Rochford?
It's been some time since
George Boleyn's death.
You've not remarried?
No.
The Duke of Suffolk, Your Majesty.
Charles,
I have something I want to show you.
I've had a medal struck
to commemorate my marriage.
"<i>Henricus VIII:</i>
"<i>Rutilands rosa sine spina</i>."
"My rose without a thorn."
Tell me,
how is Anne of Cleves?
I believe she has settled
into her new estates,
and shows every sign
of being grateful
for Your Majesty's
charity and generosity.
I also understand that she
has maintained her relationships
with Your Majesty's daughters
and often asks them
to dine with her.
- Risley.
- Majesty.
We shall write to the Lady Anne
to thank her for being so conformable,
and to assure her
that if she continues,
she will find in us
a perfect friend,
content to repute her
as our dearest sister.
Majesty.
Does the Duchess love
you any better, Charles?
She seems to...
but only for the sake
of appearances.
How can I help you Charles?
Well, when she consents
to make love to me again...
strike a medal to commemorate it!
My Lady
My Lord Surrey.
I'd rather trusted to hear from you.
Why?
When we supped together,
you gave me to suppose that...
Mr. Culpepper.
Your Majesty.
That I what, My Lord?
That you would oblige me,
and accommodate my desire.
If I gave you that
impression I am truly sorry.
It was far from my intention.
Sleep with me.
Don't you know who I am?
Of course I know who you are.
And you know who my husband is!
Yes I do!
He's a Seymour.
His family are wolves.
Mine are lions!
Forgive me...
for aiming so low!
My Lord, His Majesty
wants to see you.
The Earl of Hertford, Your majesty.
I wish I could go
dancing like all of you!
Whenever I hear the music,
I feel like nobody has
a care in the world!
Look at my cares!
I had someone once
who could take care of all of this!
But now he's gone!
How is my son?
Prince Edward is very well.
He is a strong and healthy boy.
- He does his father proud.
- Thank God.
I trust he will soon be followed
by other princes.
I'm making you a new appointment.
I'm making you
Lieutenant General to the North.
There's been too many incursions
over the border
from Scotland into England.
I want you to deal with my cousin,
the King of the Scots,
and I want these incursions stopped.
If he does not stop them,
you have our express
permission to harry
and persecute the people
on his side of the border
with as much aggression
and as much force as you see fit.
I understand.
We might, in time, meet
our cousin, King James.
For all we know, he may not be
as stupid as he appears. But for now,
I am trusting you to ensure
that the Scots cease their...
impertinence.
Katherine!
God!
Fuck me!
Fuck me...
- Katherine!
- Oh yes... oh yes...
God...
Just fuck me...
Go on! Tell me more!
I promised her I wouldn't.
Dearest Joan,
you can tell me.
I'm responsible for everything
to do with the Queen.
So, I have to know everything.
That way, I can protect her.
So, when you both lived at Lambeth,
under the protection of the Duchess,
what exactly happened?
There were these two Gallants.
They were called Frances Dereham
and Edward Waldegrave,
who was a Gentleman
in waiting upon the Duchess.
Anyway,
they found a way to call,
secretly, at night,
upon Katherine and me.
And they would lie
in our beds all night.
You with Waldegrave
and Katherine
with this Francis Dereham?
Yes. That's how it was.
And what would these gentlemen
do to you?
Didn't anyone say anything?
Didn't they find out?
Well,
if Dereham used her
as a man doth his wife,
it was only because she thought
herself already betrothed to him.
Like on a promise.
It went on between them a long time.
Still, you won't tell anyone,
will you?
You won't say anything?
She made me swear!
No. I won't say anything.
<i>Good morning!
It's a lovely day today!</i>
<i>Come on! Get out of my way!</i>
<i>What are you looking at?</i>
<i>Wait!</i>
<i>Clear out of here, you fucking slut!</i>
Hey! What in God's name
are you doing?!
Starin' at a real woman, are you?
What are you looking at? Eh?
Good sport my Lord, good sport!
Fuck of!
The Earl of Surrey has been jailed
for public disorder, Your Majesty.
The Earl maintained
he was the scourge of God?
Yes, Your Majesty.
And called London itself
"a shameless whore"?
Yes. He did indeed so.
What about eating meat during Lent?
He told us he had
a license to do so. But...
But what?
Bishop Gardiner suspects
my Lord Surrey
of obtaining his meat on the black
market from some evangelical butchers
in Honey Lane,
near the church of All Hallows.
This same church, Your Majesty,
is suspected by some
of secretly sowing and setting forth
Lutheran heresies,
and of deliberately
flouting the fasting laws.
I never thought Surrey
could be a heretic.
His father is closer to a Papist...
although to my face,
he pretends otherwise!
His Grace and I would be inclined,
with Your Majesty's permission, to...
examine the Earl more closely
on these fundamental matters.
You want to torture him?
No.
Release him... for now.
Majesty.
We should make plans
for the New Year.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I would like to invite
the Lady Mary to court.
I'd also like to
invite Anne of Cleves
for New Year's celebrations.
My Lady, here are your
presents from the King.
Presents!
So beautiful!
Look!
So shiny! Smell!
Smells of roses! It's lovely.
It's perfect!
My Lady! Look!
Oh my goodness!
His Majesty spoils you!
I know he does!
But am I not worth it?
Feel it, it's so soft.
I am the Queen of England.
Oh gold!
I love gold!
It goes with my dress.
- Happy Christmas, Ladies.
- Happy Christmas, Your Majesty.
- Where are we going?
- There are more presents.
More?
What do you think?
They're beautiful.
They were sent ahead by
Anne of Cleves as a gift.
She arrives tomorrow.
Anne of Cleves?
Yes. I've invited her for New Year.
You don't mind, do you?
No, of course I don't mind.
Your Majesty must do as you will.
But...
will I like her,
this Anne of Cleves?
Wait and see.
Stay quiet.
I hope the Lady Mary will be
more gracious than before.
<i>My Lords, Lady Mary.</i>
Your Majesty.
My beautiful daughter.
Say hello to the Queen.
Madam.
Lady Mary. I am very glad
to see you back at court.
Thank you for my gifts. Your Majesty,
as always, is more than generous.
Charles.
Lady Anne.
Your Grace.
I remember that you once
taught me to play cards.
I am very grateful.
As a result of your tuition,
I have won a fortune!
My Lords,
Lady Anne of Cleves!
Lady Anne.
Welcome to my court.
Your Majesty!
Happy Christmas.
Allow me to introduce
to you my new wife.
Your Majesty.
What a great privilege
and honour it is for me
to be presented to you.
I am so delighted.
You are very welcome to court,
Lady Anne.
We thank you so much for the
two fine horses you sent,
and wish you a very happy New Year.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I think we should all be merry!
Yes!
Ladies. Excellency.
You are not well?
These days I suffer a
little from gout, Lady Mary.
- Please sit.
- Thank you.
You are and always have been...
my most faithful...
and truest friend in all this world.
I could not bear it if you
were ever to leave here.
He ought not to have
divorced the Lady Anne.
Now that I know her better,
I think she is perfectly
sweet and gracious.
Nevertheless, Lady Mary,
I fear that you will have to
reconcile yourself to the new Queen.
No, I will not. I hate her.
Then, perhaps,
after all, you do not require
my advice any more.
My Lady, I wanted to ask if you
had any news of my brother Edward?
He's well enough. Cold, but well.
Wet, but well.
Apparently, it always rains
in the north, and the mud is free.
Will he see some action?
I believe he intends to punish
the Scots for their wickedness.
That sounds very like my brother.
If only you could be more
like him, Sir Thomas.
What do you mean?
My husband always
takes what he wants.
Ladies, you must forgive me.
I rode out early to hunt
this morning, I am very tired.
We shall dine again
together tomorrow evening.
- Lady Anne.
- Your Majesty.
My beautiful wife.
Now, I must insist
you stay to enjoy the dancing.
Boy.
Boy!
I bid you all a good night.
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year, Your Majesty!
I wonder... Will you have
some more wine, Lady Anne?
With pleasure, if Your Majesty will.
Yes.
Wine.
- Your Majesty.
- Thank you!
Lady Anne.
His Majesty tells me that
his daughter, the Lady Elizabeth,
sometimes comes to see you.
How do you find her?
Oh, she is charming.
So clever. And so beautiful.
And so very affectionate.
It is always a pleasure to see her.
You see,
I have no desire to remarry,
so I am sure I will never
have any children of my own.
I think a little that Elizabeth
is like a daughter to me.
Surely it is so:
To have had her as a daughter
would have been
a greater happiness to
me than ever being Queen.
Jesus Christ!
That's better.
May I ask Your Majesty a question?
Go on.
Why did Your Majesty invite Lady
Anne of Cleves for Christmas?
I like her, after all.
She keeps her promises, boy.
Majesty? Come!
So...
What did this Joan Bulmer tell you?
She said that...
on the nights Dereham
visited Katherine's bed,
he would bring with him wine,
strawberries, and apples,
and...
other things to make good cheer.
And then?
Then...
What then?
There would be kissing
and...
he would pull down his hose
and lie down with her.
And the two of them would
hang by their bellies
like two sparrows.
Come here.
"And the two of them would hang by
their bellies like two sparrows."
Why are you here?
Taking what I want.
Just like my brother does.
Just like he's always done.
And what if I don't want it?
What if I call my servants?
You won't.
And you know why?
Because you hate my brother.
You hate him
almost as much as I hate him
but you can't tell anyone
except me.
Well,
Mr. Seymour,
come into my bed.
Enjoy what your brother enjoys.
It will be interesting
to compare you.
<i>Credo in unum Deum
patris omnipotentum.</i>
<i>Credo in unum Deum patris</i>
<i>Patris omnipotentum.</i>
My Lady! My Lady!
The Queen is here!
Majesty.
Lady Mary, I have come here
in person to ask you
why you will not show me the respect
which, as Queen of England,
I am entitled to expect,
even from you.
I noticed, as did everyone else,
that you show
the greatest respect to the Lady Anne,
even though she is a private person
and worth no account.
Forgive me.
But surely the Lady Anne is
worthy of every respect?
She carries herself
with great dignity
and also modesty,
and desires nothing more than
to please the King, her Lord.
Do you mean
I do not try to please him?
I think you desire almost
nothing else than pleasure!
It pleases you, it seems, to do nothing
but wear pretty clothes and dance.
Some people may think that frivolous
in the consort of a King,
whose flesh is also sacred.
If his Majesty thought me
only frivolous, why did he marry me?
You are thought
capable of bearing sons.
Unfortunately,
for all the King's attentions,
I see you are still not pregnant.
In any case,
he will soon tire of you.
You'll see.
And what about you?
And what about me?
I think you're jealous.
You're jealous because
you're older than me
and you're still not married.
Perhaps you'll never be married,
and will grow old a maid!
How dare you speak to me like that.
I dare because I can.
And I can do something else, too.
As punishment for your lack of respect
towards his Majesty's wife,
I am removing two of your maids
from your service.
A good day to you, Lady Mary.
Here's to love.
To Katherine,
Queen of England.
And, God willing, may you
soon be ripe with children.
Thank you.
Both of you.
You are so kind, Lady Anne
and my gracious Lord.
I am the most happy
I have ever been in my whole life.
I have a gift for you.
Oh my God!
May I please see it, Your Majesty?
Oh, what's this?
Not more presents!
Do you like them?
Oh, I just adore them.
They're so pretty.
But...
But?
With Your Majesty's permission,
I would like to share these gifts
- with the Lady Anne.
- With me?
Oh No!
May I?
Of course.
Thank you!
So sweet!
They're yours.
- Thank you, Katherine!
- Happy New Year, Lady Anne,
Hello!
Hello.
Isn't he sweet?
Lady Mary!
What are you doing?
I'm going back to Hunsdon.
You asked his Majesty's permission?
Why are you leaving?
Haven't you heard?
She has removed two of my maids!
The Queen?
Apparently I don't treat her
with sufficient respect.
Madam, please.
I am sure if you found some
small means to conciliate the Queen,
then the maids would remain...
No! Why should I?
I don't want to conciliate her.
What did she say to you?
She said...
that I'm jealous of her.
Because she...
is married
and I'm not.
And may never be.
She ought not to have said
such things.
No, but...
they're true!
They're true!
My sweet Lady.
My poor sweet Lady.
Lady Rochford.
How is the King today,
Mr. Culpepper?
He is very well, your Majesty.
He sends you his love
and hopes you are
well looked after and entertained.
I wanted to go riding today
but the weather was too bad.
I'm sorry to hear it.
His Majesty wants you to know
that the military campaign against
the Scots has been a great success,
and he is most pleased
with Lord Hertford
and his other Captains,
who performed well in the field.
Which field?
It means the battlefield.
I'm glad.
Glad?
That they did so well.
In the field.
Is there anything else,
Mr. Culpepper?
Yes, yes. This book.
It was written by Richard Jonas,
who came with Anne of Cleves,
and meant to dedicate it
to his mistress.
But now, with Your Majesty's permission,
he would like to dedicate it to you.
What is it? Give it me.
"The Byrthe..."
"of Mankind"?
I believe it's the first major work
on midwifery to be written in English.
Midwifery?
Mr. Jonas would now like to
dedicate it to the most gracious
and in all goodness,
most excellent, virtuous lady,
I wonder what it would feel like?
What what would feel like?
I should go down to her with wine,
apples, and strawberries,
although they are all out of season.
Who are you talking about?
Who do you think I'm talking about?
Hanging by their bellies
like two sparrows!
- Do you really want to?
- What?
If you do,
I could arrange it.
My Lord.
- Thank God, your Grace!
- What's happened?
Come!
How bad is it?
Your Grace,
the ulcer on his Majesty's leg
has become clogged again.
We have no option but to drain off
the fluid which has collected there.
Otherwise...
We fear for His Majesty's life!
Forgive me, Majesty...
This is worse than ever before,
Your Grace.
What happens if the King should die?
Your Grace must pray to
heaven that he does not.
But he looks likely to die!
That is what I'm afraid of.
My Lords,
I assure you that I am not content.
I have relied upon you
to inform and counsel me
and yet I am the most deceived.
I have trusted
and favored all of you.
I have formed
a sinister opinion...
that most of you are liars
and flatterers
who look only to your own profits.
I know what you are plotting.
And if God gives me the strength,
I will see to it that none
of your projects ever succeed!
I mourn Cromwell's death.
Yes!
I mourn him.
I mourn him now
that I perceive my Councilors,
by light pretext,
and by false accusations,
made me put to death the most
faithful servant I ever had.
Culpepper.
Your Majesty, Mr. Culpepper is here.
Thank God! May I see His Majesty?
Forgive me, my Lady,
but his Majesty remains indisposed.
He sends you his love
and this as a token of it.
I thank His Majesty, but...
It is ten days since I have
been allowed into his presence.
Why will he not see me? Why?
Have I offended him in some way?
What have I done?
He cannot love me so much
if he can so easily neglect me!
Perhaps he has taken a mistress!
Has he taken a mistress?
Is that why he won't see me?
I cannot answer your Majesty.
I'm sorry.
Is he with his mistress now?
Very well. You may go,
since you will not tell me anything,
even though you see how
unhappy and miserable I am!
You know I would do
anything in the world,
anything...
To bring you comfort
and make you happy.
More than any other woman,
you deserve to be happy.
Mr. Culpepper is so handsome.
He's in love with you.
In love?
Yes.
He has confessed everything.
He loves you madly.
He told me so. He said
he would happily die for you!
And that he thinks and dreams of you
day and night.
Surrey wrote a poem about us,
- which is circulating the court.
- About us?
What does he say?
He calls you the wolf lady.
Naturally, he is the lion.
He says you tried to entrap him
but he is too noble a beast to
be tangled by such cunning hooks!
He also warns you
that if you should cross
his path again, he will feed on you as
you meant to feed on him.
He says that we rose high
by murdering the innocent!
<i>You know I'd do
anything in the world,</i>
<i>anything...</i>
<i>to bring you comfort
and make you happy.</i>
<i>More than any other woman,
you deserve to be happy.</i>
He wants to visit you.
Privately.
Who?
Culpepper.
He can't!
That's not possible.
Of course he can!
Just like that other one...
coming to you at night.
You know about that?
Of course.
Joan Bulmer told me.
And it can be just the same.
A secret.
Nobody else need ever know...
not the King,
not anybody!
Are you sure?
Come!
Come!
<i>Précédemment...</i>
Lady Anne de Clčves.
Bienvenue ŕ ma cour.
Pourquoi avoir invité
Anne de Clčves pour Noël ?
Je l'apprécie, malgré tout.
Il n'aurait pas dű divorcer
de Lady Anne.
Vous allez devoir vous réconcilier
avec la nouvelle Reine.
Certainement pas. Je la déteste.
Lord Surrey,
quelles sont vos ambitions ?
De surpasser mon pčre
et mon grand-pčre.
Le Comte nous a clairement
exprimé son mépris.
Il dit que vous voulez le piéger,
mais qu'il est une bęte trop noble
pour se prendre ŕ vos ruses !
Je suis venue vous demander
pourquoi vous ne me montrez pas
le respect qu'en tant que Reine,
je suis en droit d'attendre.
On vous pense capable
de lui donner des fils.
Malheureusement,
vous n'ętes toujours pas enceinte.
Elle est trčs attrayante.
Ętes-vous sűr ?
Je peux arranger cela.
Votre ulcčre ŕ la jambe
s'est enflammé ŕ nouveau.
La vie de Sa Majesté est en danger !
Sa Majesté est indisposée.
Il ne veut pas me voir ?
A-t-il pris une maîtresse ?
Je ne peux répondre.
- Désolé.
- Partez, si vous ne voulez rien dire.
Vous savez que je ferais tout
pour votre bien-ętre et votre bonheur.
- Il veut vous voir en privé.
- Ce n'est pas possible.
Personne ne doit savoir.
Ni le Roi
ni personne.

My Lady ! Par ici !
Non, non, non.
Je vais vous montrer.
<i>Comme ça !</i>
Vous voyez ?
<i>Élégant.</i>
Tout est <i>élégant</i>.
Magnifique !
Tout ce qui n'est pas <i>élégant</i>

Majesté.
Je ne vous ai pas vue
depuis un moment. Je suis désolé.
Je n'en connaissais pas la raison.
Personne ne me l'a dit.
J'étais souffrant.
Mais je vais mieux.
Dieu merci.
Je pense que vous avez su
vous divertir pendant mon absence ?
Votre Majesté m'a tellement manqué.
Vous avez reçu mes cadeaux ?
Ça ne vous remplace pas.
Lord Surrey.
Majesté.
Vous ętes parent avec ma femme.
Pour cela et pour votre bravoure
en France,
je vous fais Chevalier
de l'Ordre de la Jarretičre.
Cela vous plaît-il ?
Je vous suis trčs reconnaissant.
Lord Surrey.
Majesté.
J'ai quelque chose pour vous.
Merci.
Elle est belle.
Vous l'ętes aussi.
Je pars demain pour quelques jours.
Mais ce soir je viendrai
dans votre chambre.
Car rien ne me ferait plus plaisir
que de vous voir porter mon enfant.
- Bonjour, Votre Majesté.
- Votre Excellence.
Majesté, ces pauvres sujets
vous supplient

Votre Majesté pourrait-elle

RÉSIDENCE D'ANNE DE CLČVES
Bravo, my Lady. Bravo !
- Majesté.
- Majesté.
Votre Majesté.
Surprise ?
Bien.
Lady Elizabeth.
Votre Grâce.
J'ai un cadeau.
Et votre latin ?
J'aime l'étudier, merci Majesté.
M. Grindle, le tuteur
que vous m'avez fourni,
est un excellent professeur.
Ce livre est de l'historien romain
Tacite.
Vous pourriez le trouver
difficile ŕ lire,
mais il en vaut la peine.
Car sans culture,
la vie ne vaut rien.
Merci infiniment, Majesté.
Je vous suis reconnaissante
et je remercie Dieu chaque soir
de votre bonne santé,
et je sais que vous resterez
notre Roi, et mon pčre,
encore longtemps.
Madame.
Je suis venu souper.
J'espčre que ça ne vous dérange pas.
Je pense qu'il y a assez
dans le garde-manger, Majesté.
Bien.
Votre élévation ŕ l'Ordre
aura bientôt lieu, Lord Surrey.
Le roi m'a demandé
de vous y préparer,
ce que je fais volontiers
et de bon cśur.
Je suis certain que vous comprenez
la grande importance
que Sa Majesté attache ŕ l'Ordre
et le grand honneur
qu'Elle vous fait en vous y nommant.
Comme vous le savez,
l'Ordre comprend 25
nobles et vaillants chevaliers
et leur souverain.
C'est l'honneur supręme.
Votre Seigneurie
n'a pas ŕ me vanter l'Ordre.
Depuis quand y ętes-vous ?
- J'ai été nommé cette année.
- Quelques mois.
Mon pčre et quatre générations
de ma famille
lui ont déjŕ appartenu.
Mangeons.
Oů pensez-vous
que le roi soit allé ?
Je l'ignore, Votre Majesté.
C'est la pleine lune demain
et nous serons tous déments.
Pour certains,
la lune est la plančte de l'amour.
Je veux le revoir.
Si vous voulez.
Peut-ętre...
pourrais-je le conduire
ŕ ma chambre.
Et je ferais le guet
au cas oů quelqu'un viendrait.
J'exhorte Votre Majesté
ŕ ętre prudente,
- quand...
- Quoi, Lady Rochford ?
Je sais comment batifoler avec un homme
sans tomber enceinte.
Votre Majesté doit ętre fičre
de ses filles.
Des deux.
Elles vous font honneur.
Lady Mary est...
trčs sérieuse et pieuse
mais trčs intelligente.
Comme certaines femmes,
elle préfčre le cacher.
Mais Lady Elizabeth ne peut pas
le cacher.
Elle sera une grande dame,
je le pense,
si Dieu le veut.
Votre Majesté.
Je voudrais rendre quelque chose
ŕ Votre Majesté.
Mon alliance.
Vous devriez la réduire en pičces,
elle n'a aucune valeur.
Chérie ?
Oui ?
Aimez-vous qu'on se voie ainsi ?
Oui.
M'aimez-vous ?
Prouvez-le-moi avec un cadeau.
En vous embrassant ?
Nous nous sommes déjŕ embrassés,
Katherine chérie.
Vous ne m'aimez pas pour autant.
Comment vous le prouver ?
Lord Surrey,
je dois maintenant
vous parer de la jarretičre,
pour que vous la portiez
ŕ l'initiation.
"Honi soit qui mal y pense."
Monsieur.
Les compagnons les plus aimables
de cet Ordre,
dit de la Jarretičre,
vous adoubent comme ami,
frčre et compagnon,
et témoignent leur joie
par la jarretičre
qu'ils vous donnent,
que vous recevez ŕ juste titre,
pour la porter et l'utiliser
ŕ la gloire de Dieu.
Merci, mes amis,
mes frčres,
mes compagnons.
Votre Grâce.
Je vous suis trčs reconnaissant
de ne pas objecter
ŕ l'annulation de notre mariage.
J'avais une expérience opposée
des femmes.
Votre Majesté,
en vérité,
je souhaite vous plaire
en toutes choses,
en reconnaissant
vos bons traitements,
et rester dans ce pays
que j'aime déjŕ comme le mien.
Savez-vous ce que l'ambassadeur français
a écrit de vous ?
Nous avons intercepté sa lettre.
Notre peuple regrette beaucoup
notre divorce,
vous avez gagné son amour
en peu de temps
et il vous estime
l'une des plus douces,
gracieuses
et compatissantes reines
qu'il ait eu.
Vous en avez une autre désormais.
Oui.
Je l'aime bien.
Elle est belle, bien sűr.
Trčs jeune. Pleine de vie.
Vous devez l'adorer.
Madame...
Vous avez fait votre devoir.
Il est insupportable.
Il se croit supérieur ŕ nous.
Hélas,
nous lui avons fait l'immense faveur
de couronner reine
un membre de sa famille.
Ce qui est fait
peut parfois se défaire,
comme un lit.
Est-ce possible ?
Le roi est entiché d'elle.
On le sait tous.
Ça pourrait changer.
Je la trouve stupide et frivole.
En tout cas,
vous donnerez une leçon d'humilité
au duc.
Je ne laisserai aucun homme
me traiter
de louve,
et vous ne permettrez pas qu'une injure
contre votre famille reste impunie.
Sans doute,
mon cher époux,
pouvez-vous le faire
tomber en disgrâce ?
Bonjour mes amis !
Jésus-Christ !
Pas tout ŕ fait !
Comme vous voyez,
j'ai été reçu dans le noble
et prestigieux
Ordre de la Jarretičre.
Voici la jarretičre en question !
C'est une bonne devise.
Je suis d'accord.
Une bičre !
Mes responsabilités dans l'Ordre
m'ont déjŕ terriblement assoiffé.
Trčs bien, My Lord ! Merci.
Pour l'amour de Dieu,
comment pouvez-vous vous permettre ça ?
J'ai souvent été sans le sou,
mais je n'ai jamais été pauvre.
Jeune fille !
Aimeriez-vous sucer le sexe d'un homme
qui est membre
de l'Ordre de la Jarretičre ?
Que diraient vos amis ?
Ils me diraient de ne pas avaler
ce genre d'histoires.
Votre main !
Elle est...
toute nue.
Voilŕ, voilŕ, voilŕ.
Elle est habillée.
Merci.
Viens lŕ.
D'autres bičres. Buvez mon ami.
Buvez.
My Lords,
nous devons convenir de plans
pour notre avancée dans le nord
qui a trop tardé.
Nous prendrons une grande escorte,
dont des hommes armés,
puisque nous devrons visiter
des parties du royaume qui, depuis peu,
sont entrées en rébellion
contre nous.
Cette fois, nous attendons
que le peuple pardonné par Notre Grâce
fasse grand acte de soumission,
en raison de sa dépravation passée.
My Lady.
Il est aussi dans nos intentions
de rencontrer le Roi d'Écosse,
ŕ York, en septembre.
Votre Majesté.
Votre Majesté.
Votre Majesté.
Le Roi est en plein Conseil !
Préparez le transport
de nos tapisseries.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Désolé, Votre Majesté.
Venez.
- Katherine, petite sotte.
- J'ai du retard.
Je crois que je suis enceinte.
Ma douce bien-aimée...
Je dois dire ŕ Sa Majesté
que je suis désolée de l'avoir fâchée.
Je ne suis pas fâché.
Comment le pourrais-je ?
Katherine, écoutez-moi, écoutez-moi.
Pour le bien de notre enfant,
s'il vous plaît,
ne vous excitez pas.
Allez vous allonger.
Reposez-vous,
et je viendrai vous voir
trčs bientôt.
Dieu vous bénisse.
Rentrez.
Ma magnifique jeune Reine.
Rentrez.
Comment va mon pčre ?
Le Roi a récupéré
de sa récente maladie
et semble de meilleure humeur.
Il projette d'avancer
dans le nord de l'Angleterre.
De grands travaux ont commencé.
Il se dit que les brodeurs
travaillent sur des accessoires
ŕ partir des chapes et des ornements
pris dans des églises, hélas.
Excellence.
Merci, Madame.
Il y a une autre raison
ŕ l'entrain du Roi.
Il y a des rumeurs.
La Reine pense ętre enceinte.
Sa Majesté serait surement ravie
si elle lui donnait un Duc d'York.
D'un autre côté,
si elle ne le fait pas,
la question de la succession
resterait ouverte.
Comment ça ?
Edward est le premier-né.
Qui en douterait ?
Lady Mary,
certaines personnes ŕ la cour
m'ont dit
qu'elles avaient des doutes
concernant la mčre du Prince Edward.
La Reine Jane
n'a jamais été formellement couronnée,
au contraire de votre mčre,
la Reine Catherine.
La rumeur dit
que le Roi a l'intention de couronner
sa nouvelle Reine ŕ York,
et donc si elle a un fils,
personne ne pourra émettre de doute
sur sa légitimité au trône.
Mais, si elle n'avait pas de fils...
Exactement.
Cela renforcerait votre droit
ŕ réclamer la couronne.
C'est pour cela
que ces personnes m'ont assuré prier,
non seulement pour le renversement
des vils réformateurs comme Hertford,
mais pour le moment
oů Votre Grâce accédera au trône.
Si Dieu le veut, Excellence.
Si Dieu le veut.
Mais il le voudra, Lady Mary.
Sinon, comment l'obédience et la foi
seraient-elles rétablies
dans ce pays ?
Sinon, en continuant ainsi,
elles vont sombrer.
Parlez-moi de l'avancée.
Oů irons-nous ?
D'abord ŕ Hatfield,
puis ŕ Dunstable,
Ampthill et Grafton,
en chassant ŕ courre en chemin.
Ensuite ŕ Stamford,
puis ŕ Lincoln,
et enfin ŕ Boston et Yorkshire.
Vous devrez commander
de nouvelles robes
pour les grandes occasions
et les banquets pendant le trajet.
Et de grandes foules viendront voir
votre magnificence.
Je suis si excitée.
Tout cela semble un ręve
dont je voudrais
ne jamais me réveiller !
Me rejoindrez-vous dans ma chambre
ce soir ?
Non ma bien-aimée.
C'est trop dangereux.
Pas tant que vous ętes enceinte.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Vous ętes enceinte ?
Je me suis trompée.
Je me suis...
My Lady ?
My Lady ?
<i>Monsieur Culpepper,</i>
<i>c'est avec mon cśur que je me confie</i>
<i>ŕ vous...</i>
<i>et vous prie de me donner
de vos nouvelles.</i>
<i>J'aimerais que vous soyez avec moi</i>
<i>et soyez témoin de la détresse
que j'endure</i>
<i>tandis que je vous écris.</i>
"On m'a dit que vous étiez malade.
"Et je n'ai jamais tant voulu
vous voir.
"Mon cśur se brise ŕ l'idée
de ne pouvoir ętre en votre compagnie."
<i>Mon cśur se brise</i>
<i>ŕ l'idée de ne pouvoir ętre
en votre compagnie.</i>
<i>Éternellement vôtre,</i>
Katherine.
Ce n'est pas de sa faute.
Elle est si jeune.
Si. C'est de sa faute.
Vous jouez bien.
Cela n'a pas toujours été le cas.
Je ne buvais jamais de vin,
ne jouais de la musique.
Je fais tout cela ŕ présent.
Ça me plaît.
Je suis libre et ça me plaît.
Puis-je partager votre lit ce soir ?
Je suis lŕ, maintenant.
Je ne veux pas que ton cśur se brise.
Tu es si douce.
Mon adorable petite folle.
Je t'aime.
Tu ne dois pas...
Tu sais ?
Je sais.
Je promets.
Majesté, Lady Bryan.
Votre Majesté. Messire.
Votre fils, le prince Edward.
Votre Majesté. Mon oncle.
Votre Grâce.
J'espčre que l'on veille sur vous,
que vous ętes bien traité.
Oui, Sire.
J'ai un cadeau pour vous.
Merci, Votre Majesté.
Je dois m'absenter quelque temps.
Votre oncle restera.
Il faut le garder au chaud
ŕ Windsor, Lady Bryan.
Si, Dieu nous préserve,
il tombait malade,
donnez-lui ceci.
C'est ma potion personnelle.
Vous ressemblez ŕ votre mčre.
Savez-vous qui elle était ?
C'est elle.
C'était son dé ŕ coudre.
Tu es un bon garçon.
Votre épée, monsieur.
Votre Majesté.
My Lady, le roi est lŕ.
Katherine, nous quittons Whitehall
dans deux jours.
Ętes-vous pręte ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
J'allais oublier,
- Lady Mary nous accompagnera.
- Pourquoi ?
Est-ce nécessaire ?
Visiblement, vous ne comprenez pas.
Mary est appréciée dans le Nord
oů nous devons impressionner
nos sujets.
La décision n'a rien
ŕ voir avec vous.
Désolée de ne pas ętre enceinte.
Je le serai un jour.
<i>Soulevez !</i>
<i>Avancez !</i>
- <i>Ramassez !</i>
- <i>Ici, le foin !</i>
<i>Hé, petit !</i>
<i>En ligne ! Ŕ vos rangs !</i>
<i>Toi, lŕ-bas !</i>
En avant !
Suivez la cadence !
Place au roi !
- Le roi !
- Lady Mary et le roi !
Voyez combien ils nous aiment.
Voici de vrais sujets anglais.
Ils aiment leur roi.
Son Excellence, l'évęque Gardiner.
Messire.
J'espčre que je ne vous dérange pas.
Vous avez une lourde responsabilité,
en l'absence du roi.
Votre Excellence est la bienvenue.
- Comment se passe le voyage du roi ?
- Trčs bien.
Il reçoit partout un accueil chaleureux.
Et il fait bonne chasse.
La semaine derničre, il a abattu
quatre cents cerfs en deux jours.
Ils vont vers Lincoln.
Je suis ravi de savoir
que Sa Majesté est de si bonne humeur.
Je présume...
que le Comte de Surrey
fait partie de sa suite.
Tout ŕ fait.
- Messire.
- Pourquoi ?
On m'a rapporté de nouveaux faits
concernant la conduite du comte.
Il semble qu'aprčs son admission
ŕ l'Ordre de la Jarretičre,
il soit allé dans une taverne,
en grande tenue.
Il se serait moqué de l'Ordre
et de ses membres.
Devant des catins et des souteneurs.
Ce sont des déclarations
sous serment ?
Oui, Messire. Allez-vous enquęter ?
Oui, bien sűr.
Je remercie Votre Grâce
pour ces informations.
J'espčre que vous les utiliserez.
Je suis persuadé
que Surrey et sa clique
n'observent pas le caręme.
Ce sont des luthériens
et des sacramentaires fanatiques.
Ces hérésies condamnables
devraient les conduire au bűcher.
Votre Grâce.
Gauche, gauche, droite, gauche...
Henry,
par la grâce de Dieu,
roi d'Angleterre,
d'Irlande et de France,
représentant de Dieu sur Terre,
chef de son Église
et âme de tout le royaume.
Nous vous prions en toute humilité
d'inspirer, de gouverner
et de sauver votre peuple.
Nous prions Dieu,
dans son infinie miséricorde,
de bénir et maintenir dans la foi,
dans l'amour et la fécondité,
la reine Katherine
et votre fille bénie,
Lady Mary.
Amen.
Amen.
Votre Majesté.
Peuple de Lincoln.
Ai-je besoin de rappeler
que nombre d'entre vous
se sont rebellés
de façon illégitime et indigne
contre leur roi ?
Vous ętes, selon les lois divines,
tenus d'obéir.
Eh bien,
nous venons aujourd'hui
pour une autre raison.
Nous venons ici en pčlerinage,
celui du Pardon.
Nous pardonnons
ŕ nos sujets pour leurs péchés
et leur désobéissance.
Nous avons vu l'amour
que vous nous portez.
Nous avons vu les gages
et témoignages de votre loyauté.
De bon cśur,
nous pardonnons.
Voici la chambre de Votre Majesté.
Oů cela mčne-t-il ?
Aux lieux d'aisances.
Et ça ?
Un escalier dérobé.
Venez ! Je veux voir.
Et lŕ derričre ?
La chambre de Sa Majesté.
Avec ses serviteurs ?
Est-ce infecté ?
Ça pourrait ętre mieux,
je vais nettoyer.
Je comptais rejoindre la reine
ce soir.
Elle semblait si pure et belle
dans cette cathédrale.
N'est-ce pas ?
Vous étiez tous deux magnifiques.
Le peuple adore et vénčre
Votre Majesté
avec une ferveur inégalée.
Pensez-vous que le roi dorme ?
Il a du retard.
Il est presque minuit.
Oů est-il ?
- Il s'est couché.
- Allez le chercher.
- Pressons !
- Oui, My Lady.
Aidez-moi ŕ enlever ça.
- Qui est-ce ?
- Le garde.
Venez.
Je serai ŕ côté.
Je monte la garde.
Pas ici !
Oů, alors ?
Par lŕ.
Jésus-Christ.
<i>Previously...</i>
Lady Anne of Cleves.
Welcome to my court.
Why did Your Majesty invite
Lady Anne of Cleves for Christmas?
I like her after all.
He ought not to have divorced
the Lady Anne.
I fear that you will have
to reconcile yourself to the new queen.
No, I will not. I hate her.
Tell me, my Lord Surrey,
what are your ambitions?
To surpass the achievements
of my father and my grandfather.
The Earl has made it plain
that he despises us.
Says you tried to entrap him
but he is too noble a beast
to be tangled by such cunning hooks.
I have come here to ask you why
you will not show me the respect
which, as Queen of England,
I'm entitled to expect even from you.
You are thought capable
of bearing sons.
Unfortunately, I see
you are still not pregnant.
She is very appealing.
Do you really want to?
I can arrange it.
The ulcer on His Majesty's leg
has become clogged again.
I fear for His Majesty's life.
His Majesty remains indisposed.
Why will he not see me?
Has he taken a mistress?
I can't answer Your Majesty.
- I'm sorry.
- Go, since you won't tell me anything.
You know, I would do anything
to bring you comfort and make you happy.
- He wants to visit you, privately.
- That's not possible.
Nobody else need ever know.
Not the King,
not anybody.

I haven't seen you for

I did not know the reason for it.
No one told me.
I was unwell.
But now I am better.
Thank God.
I trust you found something
to amuse yourself while I was away?
I missed Your Majesty so much.
I hope they gave you my gifts.
Your gifts are not you.
My Lord Surrey.
Majesty.
You are a blood relative of my wife.
For that reason, and because
you so distinguished yourself in France,
I've decided to make you a Knight

RESIDENCE OF ANNE DE CLEVES
Bravo, my Lady. Bravo!
- Your Majesty.
- Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Did I surprise you?
Good.
Lady Elizabeth.
Your Grace.
I have a gift for you.
How is your Latin?
I enjoy learning it,
thank you, Your Majesty.
Mr Grindle, the tutor you gave me,
is an excellent teacher.
This book is by
the Roman historian Tacitus.
Now you may find it
difficult to read
but the effort will be worthwhile.
For without knowledge,
life is not worth having.
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.
I am very grateful
and thank God every night
for your good health,
and trust you will be
our good King, and father,
a long time.
Madam.
I have come for supper. I hope
that doesn't inconvenience you.
I think we may find something
in the larder, Your Majesty.
Good.
Your formal installation into the Order
will take place soon, my Lord Surrey.
The King's grace has commanded me
to prepare you for the event,
which I am happy and willing to do.
I am sure your lordship is aware
of the great significance
attached to the Order by His Majesty
and the great honor
that he conveys upon you
by electing you to it.
As you know, the Order comprises
of twenty-five
noble and valiant knights
and their sovereign.
There is no greater
honor in England.
Your lordship has no need
to sell the Order to me.
How long have you
belonged to the Order?
- I was elected earlier this year.
- A few months.
My father and four generations
of my family
have already belonged to it.
Shall we eat?
Where do you suppose
the King has gone?
I don't know, Your Majesty.
They tell me there's
a full moon tomorrow
and we shall all
behave like lunatics.
For some, the moon
is the planet of love.
I want to see him again.
As you wish.
Perhaps...
I could bring him to my room.
Then I could wait outside,
in case anyone should come.
I only urge Your Majesty
to be careful,
- when you...
- What, Lady Rochford?
Don't you think I know how to meddle
with a man without conceiving a child?
Your Majesty should be
proud of your daughters.
Both of them.
They do you a great credit.
The Lady Mary is...
very serious and religious
but very clever.
Like some women,
she likes to hide her intelligence.
But the Lady Elizabeth,
she cannot hide her intelligence.
She will be a great lady,
I think... if God so wills it.
Your Majesty.
I have something which I should
like to return to Your Majesty.
My wedding ring.
I should like you
to break it into pieces,
as a thing of no value.
Katherine?
Sweetheart?
Yes?
Do you like our meeting like this?
Yes.
Do you love me?
Let me perceive by some token
that you love me.
Shall I kiss you?
We have kissed before,
Katherine sweet.
It does not mean that you love me.
What else can I show you?
My Lord Surrey,
I am commanded now
to invest you with the Garter,
for you to wear
at your installation.
<i>"Honni soit qui mal y pense."</i>
"Evil be to him who evil thinks."
Sir.
The most friendly
Companions of this Order,
denominated from the Garter,
have admitted you, their friend,
brother, and companion,
in faithful testimony of which
they impart and give you the Garter,
which God grant that you,
deservedly receiving it,
may rightly wear
and use to the Glory of God.
Thank you, my friends,
brothers,
and companions.
Your Grace.
You know I am very grateful to you
for raising no objection
to the annulment of our marriage.
It runs rather counter
to my experience of women.
Your Majesty,
I can truly say
that I wish in all things
to please you as my Lord,
to bear testament
to your good treatment of me,
and to stay in this country
that I already love as my own.
Do you know what the French
Ambassador wrote about you?
We... intercepted his letter.
He said that our people much
regretted our divorce,
and that in a short time
you had won their love,
and that they esteemed you
as one of the most sweet,
gracious,
and humane queens they had ever had.
You have another queen now.
Yes.
I like her.
She is beautiful, of course.
And very young.
Full of life.
You must adore her.
My Lady!
My Lady...
You did your duty.
He's insufferable.
He thinks us all his inferiors.
Unfortunately,
we did him the great favor
of making
a member of his family the Queen.
What is made
can sometimes be unmade,
like a bed.
What chance is there?
The King is besotted by her.
Everyone knows that.
That may change.
She seems to me nothing
but a frivolous and stupid girl.
In any case,
I want you to teach
the Earl a lesson in humility.
I will be called a she-wolf
by no man,
nor should you allow the slanders
against our family to go unpunished.
Surely,
my dear husband,
you could arrange for some
misfortune to befall him?
Hello, my friends!
Jesus Christ!
Not quite!
As you see, I have been
received into the most noble,
most prestigious
Order of the Garter.
And here indeed is the garter!
<i>"Honni soit qui mal y pense."</i>
"Evil to him who evil thinks!"
It's a good motto.
I agree with it.
Ale, please!
My responsibilities to the Order
have already made me
dreadfully thirsty.
Very fine, my Lord! Thank you.
How in God's name did you
afford all this, my Lord?
I have often had no money,
but I have never been poor.
Wench! How would you like
to suck the cock of a man
who's a member
of the Order of the Garter?
What would your friends say?
They would tell me not to
swallow stories like that.
Your hand!
It is...
all naked.
There, there, there.
It is dressed.
Thank you.
Come here.
More ale. Drink up, my friend.
Drink up.
My Lords,
we must before long agree
on these plans
for our much-delayed progress
to the North.
We shall take a large retinue,
including men-at-arms,
since we mean to visit those parts
of our realm which, not long ago,
rose in rebellion against us
This time we expect the people,
being pardoned by Our Grace,
to make further submissions
in acknowledgments
of their past depravities.
My Lady.
It is also our intention to
invite James, King of Scots,
to meet with us at York
in September.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
The King's in Council!
Arrange for the conveyance
of our tapestries.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I apologize, Your Majesty.
Come.
- Katherine, you silly-
- I have missed my bleeding.
I believe I am with child.
My sweet sweetheart...
I had to tell Your Majesty.
I am sorry I made you angry.
I'm not angry. How could I
be any bit angry? God forbid.
Katherine, listen to me,
listen to me. Listen to me.
For the sake of our child,
please, girl, don't excite yourself.
Go and lay down.
Rest,
and I will come
and see you very, very soon.
God bless you.
Go.
My beautiful young Queen.
Go.
How is my father?
The King, having recovered
from his recent illness,
seems in much better humor, My Lady.
He is planning to make a progress
to the North of England.
A great deal of work
is already instigated.
They say that embroiderers
are working on furniture
using copes and ornaments
stripped from the churches, alas.
Excellency.
Thank you, Madam.
There is another reason
why the King's humor is improved.
There are rumors.
The Queen
is thought to be with child.
I'm sure His Majesty
would be overjoyed
if she produced a Duke of York.
On the other hand,
if she does not,
then the succession may,
in fact, remain an open question.
What do you mean?
Surely Edward is first in line?
Who could doubt it?
Lady Mary,
certain important people
at court have told me
they feel a "scruple" Of conscience
over the fact
that Prince Edward's mother,
Queen Jane, was never
ever formally crowned,
unlike your own mother,
Queen Catherine.
So the rumor also goes,
that the King intends to crown
his new Queen at York,
so if she has a son
no one can question his
legitimacy or right to the throne.
But if she does not have a son...
Exactly.
It would strengthen
your own claim to the crown.
Which is why these certain people
have assured me how they pray,
pray, not only for the overthrow
of vile reformers like Hertford,
but for the day and the hour
that Your Grace
succeeds to the throne.
Only if God wills it, Excellency.
Only if God wills it.
But He must will it, Lady Mary.
For how else will this country
ever be restored to obedience
and to faith?
Otherwise, as things are,
it will go to the devil.
Tell me more about the progress.
Where shall we go?
First to Hatfield,
then to Dunstable,
Ampthill, and Grafton,
hunting and hawking along the way.
Then to Stamford,
and then Lincoln,
and so on to Boston and Yorkshire.
You'll have to have
plenty of new dresses made,
for there will be many great
occasions and banquets along the way,
and great crowds will come
to see your magnificence.
I'm so excited.
All of this seems to me
still like a dream,
from which I hope never to wake!
Will you come to my
bedchamber tonight?
No, sweetheart.
It's too dangerous.
Not while you're with child.
What's the matter?
You are with child?
I was mistaken.
I miss...
My Lady?
My Lady?
<i>Master Culpepper,</i>
<i>I heartily recommend me</i>
<i>unto you...</i>
<i>Praying you send me word
how that you do.</i>
<i>I would you were with me now</i>
<i>that you might see what pain I take</i>
<i>in writing to you.</i>
"I heard that you were sick.
And never longed so much
for anything as to see you."
"It makes my heart die to think
I can't always be in your company."
<i>It makes my heart die</i>
<i>to think I cannot always
be in your company.</i>
<i>Yours... as long as life endures,</i>
Katherine.
It's not her fault, she's so young.
No. That is her fault.
You play well.
You didn't used to, I remember.
And I never used to drink wine,
or play music.
Now I do all those things...
and I like to do it.
I am free, and I like to do it.
May I come to your bed tonight?
I'm here now.
I don't want your heart to die.
You feel so sweet.
My sweet little fool.
I love you.
You mustn't...
You know?
I won't.
I promise.
Your Majesty,
Lady Bryan.
Your Majesty. My Lord.
Here is your son, Prince Edward.
Your Majesty. Uncle.
Your Grace.
Edward.
I trust you are well looked after
and everybody is kind to you.
Yes, sir.
I have a gift for you.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I have to go away
from London for a while.
But your uncle will stay here.
He is to be kept warm and well
at Windsor, Lady Bryan.
And if, heaven forbid,
you should fall ill,
dose him with this.
It's my own concoction.
I can see your mother in you.
Do you know who she was?
This is her.
And this is her thimble.
You're a good boy.
Your sword, sir.
Your Majesty.
My Lady, the King is here.
Katherine, I've come to tell you that
we are leaving Whitehall in 2 days time.
I trust you are prepared.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I've also come to tell you,
- the Lady Mary will be accompanying us.
- Why?
Must she come?
Obviously you don't understand.
Mary is a much-loved
figure in the North,
where we mean to impress
our subjects.
The decision has
nothing to do with you.
I'm sorry I was not with child.
I am sure I can be.
<i>Lift it!</i>
<i>Keep moving!</i>
-<i> Gather it up!
- Hay up!</i>
<i>Boy!</i>
<i>Keep in line! Fall in!</i>
<i>You there!</i>
<i>Keep moving!</i>
<i>There's the King!</i>
- The King!
- Lady Mary and the King!
You see how much they love us?
These are the real people
of England.
They love their King.
His Grace, Bishop Gardiner.
My Lord. I trust
I am not disturbing you.
I know you bear a heavy burden,
in His Majesty's absence.
Your Grace is most welcome.
- How goes the King's progress?
- Most excellently.
He has been graciously received
everywhere. And he has had good sport.
Just last week he and his companions
shot over four hundred deer in two days.
They're going to Lincoln.
I am very glad to hear
His Majesty is in such good spirits.
I suppose...
he would number among his companions
the Earl of Surrey.
Yes, for certain.
- My Lord.
- Why?
I have received more reports
of the Earl's behavior.
It seems that, after his investiture
into the Order of the Garter,
he appeared in a tavern
in his regalia
and made great fun of the Order
and of those belonging to it.
Even before bawds and pimps.
And these are sworn
statements of his behavior?
They are, my Lord.
Are you going to investigate further?
Yes, I will.
I am most grateful to Your Grace
for this information.
I trust that someday
you will use it.
For I am as convinced as I can be
that Surrey and his crew
flout the fasting laws
and are fanatic Lutherans
and Sacramentarians
for which damnable heresies
they ought to be burned
at Smithfield.
Your Grace.
<i>Left, right, left, right,
left, right...</i>
Henry,
by the Grace of God,
King of England,
Ireland, and France;
also God's High Minister here,
Head of His Church
and soul of the whole kingdom.
We beseech you in all humility
to animate, rule
and save your people.
And we further pray God,
of his infinite mercy,
that he will bless
and maintain in faith,
in love, and in fecundity
Queen Katherine
and your blessed daughter,
Lady Mary.
Amen.
Amen.
Your Majesty.
People of Lincoln.
Do I need to remind you
many of you here and about rose up
in an unnatural and unlawful
rebellion against your King,
who you, by the laws of God,
are bound to obey.
Well,
today we come here
for an altogether different reason.
Today we come here
on a Pilgrimage of Forgiveness.
We are here to pardon
all our subjects
for their past sins and disobedience.
And since we have seen
how much you love us,
and seen all your tokens
and signs of loyalty,
with a free heart,
we forgive you.
<i>Here is Your Majesty's bedchamber.</i>
Where does this go?
To the stool chamber.
And that?
To the backstairs.
Come on! I want to see.
What's behind here?
His Majesty's bedchamber.
With his servants?
It looks bad, doesn't it?
I have seen it better, Your Majesty.
But I'll bathe it.
I wanted to visit the Queen tonight.
She looked so pure and beautiful
in the cathedral today.
Don't you think?
You were both magnificent.
And the people adored
and worshipped Your Majesty
such as I have never seen the like.
Do you think the King's asleep yet?
He must be late.
It's almost midnight.
Where is he?
- He has gone to sleep.
- Go and fetch him.
- Hurry!
- Yes, my Lady.
Help me change out of this.
- Who's that?
- The night watchman.
Come.
I'll stay out here.
I'll watch outside.
Not in here!
Where then?
In here.
Jesus Christ.
<i>Précédemment dans The Tudors...</i>
Il y a trop d'incursions
entre l'Écosse et l'Angleterre.
Vous traiterez avec mon cousin,
le roi d'Écosse,
assurez-vous que les Écossais
cessent leurs impertinences.
Ça fait longtemps.
Je pense que vous avez su
vous divertir pendant mon absence ?
Votre Majesté m'a tellement manqué.
Je pensais
ŕ ceux qui ne sont plus parmi nous.
Un instant de nostalgie,
męme pour mes ennemis.
Convenons de plans pour notre avancée
au nord, qui a trop tardé.
On prendra des hommes armés,
puisqu'on visitera des régions du pays
qui, depuis peu,
sont entrées en rébellion contre nous.
Promettez de ne plus jamais
tenir d'assemblée illégale.
En échange,
Sa Majesté vous garantit son pardon.
Votre fils.
Vous ressemblez ŕ votre mčre.
Savez-vous qui elle était ?
C'est elle.
C'était son dé ŕ coudre.
Vous ętes un bon garçon.
Nous quittons Whitehall
dans deux jours.
- Lady Mary nous accompagnera.
- Vraiment ?
Mary est appréciée dans le Nord
oů nous devons impressionner nos sujets.
La décision n'a rien
ŕ voir avec vous.
Deux galants nous rendaient visite,
la nuit.
Katherine avec Francis Dereham ?
- Puis quoi ?
- Ils s'embrassaient.
Et ils se collaient ventre contre ventre
comme deux tourtereaux.
Je veux le revoir.
J'exhorte Votre Majesté
ŕ ętre prudente.
Je sais
comment batifoler avec un homme.
Je comptais rejoindre la reine.
Elle semblait si pure et belle
aujourd'hui, n'est-ce pas ?
Jésus-Christ !
The Henry's Team.

<i>Le Roi approche.</i>
Sa Majesté arrive.
Pręt !
Attention !
Tournez ŕ droite !
Pręt !
Sir Ralph, Messires et messieurs,
grâce ŕ Dieu, je me trouve enfin
parmi mes fidčles serviteurs
du Yorkshire et du Nord.
Permettez-moi
de vous présenter mon épouse.
Votre Majesté.
Vous connaissez ma fille aînée,
Lady Mary.
My Lady.
Vos Majestés,
et vous tous qui les accompagnez,
soyez les bienvenus
au Château de Pontefract.
Puisse votre séjour ici
vous apporter plaisir et richesse.
- Sir Ralph.
- Votre Majesté.
Je dormirai avec la Reine, ce soir.
Amenez-la-moi.
Majesté.
Le Roi semble réjoui.
Sa Majesté va trčs bien, Sir Ralph.
La nouvelle Reine
lui a donné un regain de vitalité.
Son voyage a été joyeux.
Les foules l'ont acclamé.
D'éminents hommes l'ont encensé.
Sous peu, des hommes
viendront exprimer leur honte
d'avoir porté l'emblčme
de la rébellion.
Bienvenue au Château de Pontefract,
Votre Grâce.
Pardonnez-moi.
Ces murs doivent vous rappeler
d'autres temps.
En effet.
Je dois vous avouer, Sir Ralph,
que ce château est rempli de fantômes
que je devrais plutôt oublier.
Pour moi aussi.
Je sais
que c'était un grand traître,
mais Lord Darcy, le vieux Tom,
semble toujours hanter ces remparts.
Je m'attends ŕ le voir
en allant me coucher.
Dites-moi franchement.
Que font les gens
sans leurs saints,
leurs superstitions,
leurs monastčres ?
Quelques-uns
bougonnent sur les niches vides
dans les églises,
sur l'absence de bougies
et de pričres pour les morts.
Mais avec la mort de Cromwell,
la réforme semble ralentir.
Ou est finie ?
Nul ne sait si le Roi
va continuer ŕ supprimer les autels
ou retourner aux vieilles croyances.
Ils ne parlent pas,
de peur de commettre une erreur.
Il n'est pas toujours aisé
de lire l'esprit du Roi.
- Lady Rochford.
- Maître Culpepper.
Sa Majesté va vous recevoir.
Plus tard ?
Votre Majesté, la Reine est ici.
L'Empereur et le Roi de France
sont au bord de la guerre.
Votre Majesté
ne veut peut-ętre pas me voir...
en un tel moment.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que...
vous avez des affaires
plus importantes.
Plus importantes que vous ?
Laissez-les avoir leur guerre.
Savez-vous qui est mort,
dans ce château ?
Une multitude.
Je parle d'hommes importants.
Richard II est mort ici,
aprčs avoir été renversé.
Il avait 33 ans.
Ils l'ont emprisonné et affamé.
Pauvre fantôme.
Il a commis l'erreur
de préférer des roturiers ŕ des nobles.
Certains d'entre eux
sont déterminés
ŕ remplacer la noblesse,
mais aussi ŕ nous détruire.
Parfois, Messire, c'est ainsi.
Mais le Roi a raison
de donner fonctions et rangs
ŕ des hommes qualifiés.
Ces hommes de vile naissance,
anoblis par le Roi,
ont été la risée
de toute la noblesse de ce royaume !
Et si Dieu rappelle le Roi,
ils souffriront.
Messire,
prenez garde
ŕ ne pas désirer la mort du Roi.
C'est une trahison.
Sir Thomas,
je pense que votre ami Surrey
vous est hostile.
Sa Majesté, le Roi !
M. Sidwell, Votre Majesté.
Vos humbles serviteurs,
pauvres hčres que nous sommes,
avouent avoir,
gravement et sans raison,
atrocement offensé Votre Majesté.
Nos actes contre nature
furent odieux
et détestables,
notre désobéissance scandaleuse
et notre rébellion déloyale.
Nous prions Votre Majesté
de chasser de son esprit
tout sentiment d'outrage
qu'elle pourrait
encore avoir envers nous.
Désormais, nous prierons
sans cesse pour votre sauvegarde
et celle de votre reine
et de votre fils, le Prince Edward.
Que Dieu Tout-puissant nous aide.
Je n'ai aucun
ressentiment envers vous.
Et, contre ces preuves de loyauté,
je vous pardonne toutes vos offenses
ŕ Notre égard.
Vive le Roi !
Lady Mary Tudor.
Dieu bénisse Votre Majesté !
My Lady !
Réveillez-vous !
Joan ?
Quelle heure...
Voyez.
<i>Dieu bénisse Lady Mary !</i>
<i>Je veux que vous disiez une pričre
pour Sa Majesté le Roi.</i>
Nous prions pour que le rčgne
de Sa Majesté soit long et béni
et pour sa bonne santé.
Au nom de la Sainte Vierge
dont le fils
est mort pour nos péchés.
Au nom du Pčre, du Fils
et du Saint-Esprit,
je vous bénis tous.
Tout ira pour le mieux.
Tout ira pour le mieux pour tout.
<i>Benedictus Deus.</i>
<i>Dieu bénisse Sa Majesté !</i>
<i>Vive la lignée des Tudors !</i>
Un petit oiseau.
Bien choisi, parce que...
c'est un petit oiseau.
Qu'est-ce ?
C'est lui !
C'est bien lui, non ?
M. Francis Dereham, Votre Majesté.
Votre Majesté.
M. Dereham.
Je vous en prie,
appelez-moi Francis.
- Qu'est-ce qui vous amčne ?
- Je suis venu vous donner ceci.
- Qu'est-ce ?
- Une lettre de recommandation.
Votre Majesté
se souvient de la Duchesse ?
Quel besoin de cette lettre ?
Je pense que c'est nécessaire
quand on cherche un poste.
Vous verrez que dans sa maisonnée,
j'ai eu de hautes fonctions
depuis notre derničre rencontre
et qu'elle me recommande.
Je ne peux pas
vous offrir une place.
Pourquoi ?
Vous avez une grande maisonnée.
Avez-vous un secrétaire ?
J'en ferais un excellent.
Vous comprenez bien que
je ne peux rien vous proposer.
Mais vous avez bien employé
Joan Bulmer, non ?
Et elle sait ce que je sais...
Quelle différence ?
J'ai remarqué
qu'une de vos demoiselles m'a annoncé.
Vous n'avez pas de majordome ?
Je suis sűr que vous devriez,
étant donné qui vous ętes.
Je ne le peux.
Mais si vous le pouvez,
Votre Majesté.
Vous ętes la Reine, aprčs tout.
Vous faites ŕ votre guise.
D'accord.
Mais attention ŕ ce que vous dites !
Votre Majesté.
Votre Majesté,
l'ambassadeur de France.
- Excellence !
- Majesté.
Vous rapporterez ŕ votre maître
ce que vous avez vu ici.
Des milliers d'ex-rebelles
venus implorer leur souverain !
Je relaterai bien sűr ŕ mon Roi,
ces faits extraordinaires.
Non. Dites-lui
qu'aprčs ce que vous avez vu
il serait téméraire d'envisager
d'envahir cette île
en pensant ŕ tort
qu'elle est déchirée
par la querelle religieuse
et truffée de mécontents.
Majesté, je suis sűr
que mon Roi n'a pas de tels projets.
Au contraire, il voit
l'Angleterre comme un allié naturel
contre l'Empereur.
Bien,
Excellence.
Votre Grâce, oů en sont les préparatifs
pour notre visite ŕ York ?
Majesté,
des chambres sont préparées
dans l'ancienne abbaye de St Mary,
meublées avec vos tapisseries
et la vaisselle venues de Londres.
Des tentes ont été érigées pour
héberger votre cour
ainsi que celle du Roi James.
Bien.
Ma chérie, comment allez-vous ?
Je vais bien, merci.
Votre Majesté.
Je dois vous dire
que j'ai nommé mon nouveau
secrétaire et majordome.
Comment ?
Écrirez-vous des lettres désormais ?
- Cela vous dérange ?
- Je vous ai dit de faire ŕ votre gré.
Merci.
Mon Oncle.
Mon Oncle.
Madame, ŕ votre santé !
Merci, votre Grâce.
Bonjour Joan.
Comme au bon vieux temps, hein ?
Non.
C'est différent, cette fois.
Vous le savez parfaitement.
Imaginez-vous, Joanie !
Notre petite Kate
est Reine d'Angleterre.
Elle n'est plus notre Kate.
Elle lui appartient.
Elle appartient au Roi.
Ne l'oubliez pas.
Ne vous faites surtout pas d'idées.
Quel genre d'idées ?
Vous savez trčs bien
de quoi je parle.
Ces jours sont révolus, Francis.
C'est fini !
C'est la belle vie.
C'est la plus belle vie
que nous puissions imaginer !
Pour l'amour de Dieu,
ne la gâchez pas.
Ni pour nous, ni pour elle !
Alors,
oů dois-je dormir ?
Pas ici.
Pas avec nous !
Pour l'amour de Dieu,
demandez un endroit
au chambellan du Roi.
Comprenez-vous ?
En quelque sorte.
Qu'est-ce ?
Juste un baiser
Par nostalgie !
Qui est lŕ ?
Lord Darcy.
Votre Grâce.
Vous ętes mort.
Oui, mais pas encore au repos.
Les vivants ignorent
que les morts récents
sont toujours autour d'eux
Nous errons pour nous repentir
et veiller sur nos parents
en attendant notre deuxičme mort.
Pourquoi m'apparaissez-vous ?
Je suis parmi les morts.
J'ai rejoint les fantômes
de vos victimes, Votre Grâce.
Ne soyez pas peiné
car ils ne sont pas amers.
Męme les enfants ne pensent
qu'ŕ arręter ce mouvement infini,
se précipitant çŕ et lŕ,
comme nos doubles terrestres.
Quand nous aurons réglé nos comptes,
les anges viendront nous chercher,
pour que nous reposions en paix.
J'aimerais ne pas avoir été dérangé.
Et lŕ, je souhaiterais
que vous soyez lŕ.
Je ne suis pas vraiment lŕ.
Mais je peux vous voir
et vous entendre.
Vous ętes...
Darcy.
Je ne suis pas Darcy !
Je ne suis rien !
Si vous tendiez votre main
pour me toucher,
vous ne trouveriez que de l'air.
Désolé de vous avoir trahi.
Pardonnez-moi.
Vieux Tom.
Je ne peux pas.
Les vivants sont si égoďstes.
Ils ne pensent ŕ rien d'autre
qu'ŕ eux-męmes.

- My Lady.
- Votre Majesté.
Qui est-ce ?
C'est Francis Dereham.
D'oů vient-il ?
Je l'ai connu il y a longtemps.
Nous avons vécu
avec la Duchesse Douairičre.
Elle m'a écrit
pour me le recommander.
Ŕ quel point l'avez-vous connu ?
Comment ?
Ŕ quel point l'avez-vous connu ?
Nous étions des enfants.
Vous ne l'avez jamais été.
- Jamais.
- Vous devriez savoir.
Ne me touchez pas !
Ne me touchez jamais comme ça !
Vous oubliez qui je suis.
Ou ce que je pourrais vous faire.
Vous ne pensiez pas ętre le seul ?
J'ai beaucoup d'amants
en dehors de vous !
Maintenant sortez !
Sortez !
Votre Majesté.
CATHÉDRALE DE YORK MINSTER
Votre Grâce !
Votre Majesté.
Le clergé dévoué
ŕ l'Église Anglicane de Votre Majesté,
la noblesse
et les gentilshommes d'York,
vous accueillent chaleureusement.
En signe de gratitude
pour le pardon gracieux de Votre Majesté
pour nos anciens et graves péchés,
nous espérons
que Votre Majesté acceptera
ces bourses d'or.
Nous remercions Votre Grâce.
Nous remercions York.
Tout est pręt
pour la visite du Roi ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Le Roi James attend.
J'ai envoyé des messages
pour le rassurer.
Pourquoi ?
Que craint-il ?
Pense-t-il qu'on voudrait le tuer ?
Et c'est le męme ?
Celui qui la visitait ?
Et ŕ qui elle était promise ?
Oui, My Lady.
Le męme gentilhomme.
Puis-je vous y intéresser ?
Il n'a pas beaucoup changé.
A-t-il toujours été si familier ?
C'est sa façon d'ętre.
Que Dieu nous aide.
Du vin, My Lady ?
- Non, merci.
- Oh, allez.
Un peu. Un verre.
J'ai dit non, M. Dereham.
Merci.
Bon Dieu !
Je vais me coucher.
- Votre Majesté.
- Mesdames ?
Venez, Mesdames.
Mesdames.
M. Dereham,
j'ignore qui vous ętes,
mais vous n'avez pas le droit
d'ętre aussi familier avec la Reine.
Ou de blasphémer en sa présence.
M. Fell,
je connais bien mieux la Reine
que vous.
- Je ne pense pas.
- Que voulez-vous dire par lŕ ?
Elle s'appelle Katherine Howard,
et je l'ai bien connue.
Nous étions trčs proches.
Trčs proches.
Bonne nuit, doux Edward.
Lady Bryan !
Lady Bryan ! Venez vite !
Il a de la fičvre.
Touchez son front.
- Allez chercher un médecin !
- Oui Madame.
- Envoyez un message ŕ Lord Hertford.
- Oui, Madame.
Pauvre agneau.
Votre comportement est indigne.
Je veux que vous promettiez
de ne plus parler ŕ la Reine
d'une maničre
qui pourrait offenser sa dignité.
Sa dignité ?
Je lui parlerai comme je l'entends.
Mais vous ne devez pas
ętre si familier.
Si familier ?
Mais nous sommes trčs familiers !
Pour l'amour de Dieu !
Votre vantardise et vos mensonges
ne font du mal qu'ŕ vous-męme.
Mes mensonges ?
Vous croyez que je mens ?
Laissez-moi vous dire une chose.
Je connais assez Katherine Howard
pour avoir eu sa chatte.
Mon Dieu !
Et je la reconnaîtrais
parmi une centaine.
Je veux
que vous lui donniez un message.
Ŕ qui, Votre Majesté ?
Vous le savez !
Culpepper.
- Dites-lui... que je dois le voir.
- My Lady...
Qu'il y a un passage
dans ma chambre.
Dites-lui de venir demain
quand le Roi sera endormi.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Un genre de fičvre tertiaire,
My Lord Hertford.
Va-t-il mourir ?
Va-t-il mourir ? Répondez.
Peut-ętre, si la fičvre persiste.
Nous avons des remčdes, Messire.
Faut-il avertir le roi ?
S'il devait écourter son voyage
et revenir en hâte
pour trouver le prince guéri...
Essayez vos remčdes.
Pour Dieu
et pour la paix du royaume,
ne le laissez pas mourir.
C'est intéressant.
C'est votre cousin, je crois ?
Votre Majesté.
Bonjour, mesdames.
Majesté.
Pardon, je vous ai négligée.
J'avais beaucoup ŕ faire
avec mes conseillers.
Mon neveu James, le roi d'Écosse,
doit nous rendre visite.
Nous signerons un traité de paix.
Nous rentrerons ensuite ŕ Londres.
Je vous le promets.
J'obéis ŕ Votre Majesté.
Toujours.
Dites-moi,
se peut-il que vous soyez enceinte ?
Messieurs.
On dit que le roi d'Écosse
est en chemin.
York sera remplie d'Écossais ivres
avec leurs bras musclés
et leurs toges.
Quelle aubaine pour vous, mesdames !
Assis, M. Dereham.
- Avez-vous transmis le message ?
- Oui.
Viendra-t-il ?
Nous avons connu un Écossais.
Quel était son nom ?
Vous souvenez-vous ?
Quel était-il ?
Manox.
Avez-vous oublié Manox ?
Monsieur ?
Joan, vous devez vous le rappeler.
Il me semble que vous et lui...
Ça suffit.
Mesdames.
Majesté.
Messieurs.
Comment osez-vous ?
J'avertirai le roi.
Il doit savoir comment son épouse
est traitée par ses serviteurs.
Allez au diable, Fell !
M. Dereham ! Arrętez !
Arrętez !
Qu'est-ce, Messire ?
Oh, rien. Une bagatelle.
Il se peut qu'un jour,
vos bagatelles vous classent
parmi nos plus grands počtes.
Votre Grâce
est donc autorisée ŕ la lire.
C'est la traduction,
arrangée en sonnet,
d'un épigramme de Martial.
Le počte romain,
mais cela n'a pas importance.
Ça parle...
de la vie heureuse.
Du juste milieu.
"Voilŕ ce qui rend la vie heureuse :
"Une fortune acquise sans peine
"Un sol fertile
"Un esprit en paix
"Un égal pour ami
"Ni rancune ni querelle
"Ni responsabilité ni pouvoir
"Une bonne santé, une vie saine
"La sagesse et la simplicité
"La nuit libérée de ses fardeaux."
Un esprit en paix.
La nuit libérée de ses fardeaux.
La sagesse et la simplicité.
Seigneur, si tout cela existait.
Parmi ces choses,
que vous manque-t-il ?
Tout.
Alors vous ętes comme moi.
Comme les Romains.
Comme les barbares.
Comme toutes les générations passées
et les générations ŕ venir.
Qui ne désirerait de tout son coeur
avoir l'esprit en paix ?
Est-il une seule âme
qui ait trouvé la paix ?
Vous avez changé d'avis ?
Je vous aime.
Vous le savez.
Je ne désire rien d'autre
que de vous voir.
Mon coeur se brise
quand je ne peux vous voir.
Je vous aime aussi.
Mais ce Dereham,
vous devez le renvoyer.
Oui, je sais. Je le ferai.
Je le promets.
Dčs notre retour ŕ Londres.
Ętes-vous toujours fâché ?
Ne soyez pas fâché contre moi.
Je désire vous obéir.
Tu sais ce que je veux.
Fais-le.
C'est ça.
Oui. C'est ça, ma douce.
Ma petite sotte ŕ moi.
Le cadeau pour le roi d'Écosse.
Qu'avez-vous ŕ dire ? Parlez.
Majesté,
le roi ne viendra pas.
Il est rentré ŕ Édimbourg.
Il y a pire, que Dieu leur pardonne.
Une armée écossaise
a franchi la frontičre,
harcčle le peuple, saccage
et brűle les fermes.
Ils tuent tous leurs opposants.
Majesté.
Organisez les représailles.
Pillez, incendiez, tuez.
Trois ripostes pour chaque attaque.
Oui, Majesté.
Je m'en occupe sur-le-champ.
Majesté.
Que voulez-vous ?
Parlez ou je vous coupe la langue !
Je dois vous annoncer
que votre fils,
le prince Edward,
est gravement malade.
Votre Majesté.
Seigneur,
ayez pitié de mon frčre Edward.
<i>Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris Filim.</i>
Pčre.
Messire,
faites appeler l'évęque de Londres.
Qu'il organise une messe
dans la chapelle royale.
Je veux remercier Dieu
pour mon fils et mon épouse.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Au nom du Pčre, du Fils
et du Saint-Esprit.
En ce jour de Toussaint,
Sa Majesté remercie Dieu
de l'avoir dotée
d'une épouse si parfaite,
la reine Katherine.
Les mots de Sa Majesté :
"Je rends grâce ŕ Dieu,

<i>Previously on The Tudors...</i>
There's been too many incursions over
the border from Scotland into England.
I want you to deal with my cousin,
the King of the Scots,
to ensure that the Scots
cease their... impertinence.
I haven't seen you for a while.
I trust you found something
to amuse yourself when I was away?
I missed your Majesty so much.
I was just thinking of those
who are no longer here to sup with us.
I had a moment of nostalgia
even for my enemies.
We must agree on these plans for
our much-delayed progress to the North.
We shall take men-at-arms-since we mean
to visit those parts of our realm
which, not long ago, rose up
in treacherous rebellion against us.
You promise never again
to make unlawful assembly.
In return, his Majesty
will grant you mercy.
Your son, Edward.
I can see your mother in you.
Do you know who she was?
This is her.
And this is her thimble.
You're a good boy.
Katherine, I've come to tell you
we're leaving in two days.
- Mary will be accompanying us.
- Must she come?
Mary is a much-loved figure in the North
where we mean to impress our subjects.
The decision has nothing
to do with you.
There were these 2 gallants, they found
a way to call upon Katherine and me.
- Katherine with this Francis Dereham?
- Yes!
- What then?
- They would be kissing.
And the two of them would hang
by their bellies like two sparrows.
I want to see him again.
I only urge your Majesty
to be careful.
What? Don't you think I know
how to meddle with a man?
I wanted to visit the Queen tonight.
She looked so pure and beautiful
today, don't you think?
Jesus Christ!

<i>The King approaches!</i>
His Majesty's coming!
Ready!
{\a3}Attention!
{\a3}Right turn!
Ready!
{\a3}Sir Ralph, my lords and gentlemen,
I thank God at last, I've been able
to come among my faithful servants
in Yorkshire and the North.
Allow me to introduce my wife,
{\a3}Queen Katherine.
{\a3}Your Majesty.
And you know my eldest daughter,
the Lady Mary.
My Lady.
Your Majesties,
and all those with you,
are welcome to Pontefract Castle.
I trust your stay here will bring you
both pleasure and profit.
- Sir Ralph.
- Your Majesty.
Culpepper!
I will sleep with the Queen tonight.
Bring her to me.
Majesty.
The King seems in good spirits,
your Grace.
His Majesty is very well, Sir Ralph.
He has both a new Queen
and it seems a new lease on life.
His progress here has been joyful.
Crowds have come out to cheer him.
Eminent men have made
speeches to praise him.
There will be men come here too
now and in a while,
who once wore the emblem of rebellion
came now to express their shame for it.
Welcome back to Pontefract
Castle, your Grace.
Forgive me.
These walls must remind
your Grace of other times.
They do.
I must confess to you, Sir Ralph,
this hall is filled with ghostly
presences that I should rather forget.
For me, too.
I know he was an arch traitor,
but my Lord Darcy-Old Tom-
he still seems to haunt
these battlements.
I half expect to see him
on my way to bed.
Tell me, truly.
How do the people cope
without their saints,
their superstitions,
their monasteries?
There are some-a few-
who still grumble at the empty
niches in the churches,
the absence of candles
and prayers for the dead.
But it seems with the death
of Secretary Cromwell
that the reforming zeal
has slackened.
Or has it?
No one knows whether the King means
to continue stripping the altars,
or return to the old ways.
They're afraid to open their mouths,
in case they should say the wrong thing.
It is not always easy to read
the King's mind, Sir Ralph.
Majesty.
My Lady.
- Lady Rochford.
- Master Culpepper.
His Majesty is ready to receive you.
Later?
Your Majesty, the Queen is here.
Your Majesty.
The Emperor and the King of France
are on the brink of war.
Surely your Majesty
does not want to see me...
at such a time.
Why?
Because...
you have more important matters.
More important than you?
Yes.
Let them have their war.
Do you know who died here,
in this castle?
Plenty, I suspect.
No. Important men.
No.
Richard the Second died here,
after he was deposed.
He was 33 years of age.
They kept him here as a prisoner.
They starved him to death.
Poor ghost.
He made the mistake of favouring
lesser men over greater ones.
For such mean creatures
are determined not just
to usurp the nobility,
but to destroy us altogether.
Sometimes, my Lord, it may be so.
But surely the King is right
where he gives offices and dignities
to those with the right qualities?
No.
Those men that are made
by the King of vile birth
have been the distraction
of all the nobility of this realm!
And if God calls away the King,
they will suffer for it!
My Lord,
be careful not to wish
the King's life away.
That is treason!
Sir Thomas,
I think your friend Surrey
is snarling at you.
His Majesty, the King!
Mr. Sidwell, your Majesty.
Your Majesty, we
your humble servants
confess that we wretches
have most grievously, wantonly,
and heinously offended Your Majesty
in the most unnatural, odious,
and distasteful acts
of outrageous disobedience
and traitorous rebellion.
We beg your Majesty to rid your mind
of any relics of indignation
you might still harbour against us,
and we pray henceforward
to pray ceaselessly
for your preservation,
and for that of your queen and
of your son, the Prince Edward,
so God Almighty help us!
I harbour
no relics of indignation
against you.
And for these shows of loyalty
I forgive you all
your trespasses against us.
Long live the King!
The Lady Mary Tudor.
God bless your Majesty!
My Lady! My Lady! Wake up!
Joan?
What time...
Look.
<i>God bless Lady Mary!</i>
<i>I want you to say a prayer for
his Grace, the King's Majesty.</i>
We pray for his Majesty's
long and blessed reign
and for his good health.
In the name of the Blessed Virgin
whose only Son died
in agony for our sins.
In the name of the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost,
I bless all of you.
All shall be well.
All manner of things shall be well.
<i>Benedictus Deus.</i>
<i>God bless his Majesty!</i>
<i>Long live the house of Tudor!</i>
A woodcock.
Good choice, Because...
it's a cock.
What is it?
It's him!
It is him, isn't it?
Mr. Francis Dereham, your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Mr. Dereham.
Francis, please, Your Majesty.
- Why have you come here?
- I came to give you this.
What is it? -
A letter of recommendation
from the Dowager Duchess.
You remember the Duchess,
don't you, your Majesty?
Why do you need such a letter?
I believe such a thing is obligatory
if one is seeking employment.
When you read it, you will see
that since we last met
I have held a number of responsible
positions in the Duchess's household,
for which she freely commends me.
It is not possible for me
to offer you employment...
Francis.
But why not?
You must keep a large establishment.
But do you have a secretary?
I would make an excellent secretary.
Surely you can understand
why I cannot offer you anything?
But you employed Joan Bulmer,
didn't you?
And she knows what I know, so...
what is the difference?
I was bound to notice
that one of your ladies announced me.
Does that mean you have
no usher for your chamber?
I am very sure you ought to,
considering who you are.
I can't...
But you can, your Majesty.
You are, after all,
the Queen of England.
You can do as you will.
All right.
Just take care what words you speak!
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, the French Ambassador.
- Excellency!
- Your Majesty.
You will not forget to convey
to your master what you've seen here.
Thousands of former rebels
offering their supplication
to their anointed King!
I will, of course, convey
these tremendous events to his Majesty.
No. You will tell him,
based on what you have seen,
that it would be foolish to contemplate
an invasion of this island
in the mistaken belief
that it is riven
with religious discord
and full of discontented men.
Majesty, I am very sure
that my master has no such plans.
On the contrary, he regards
England as his natural ally
against the Emperor.
Good,
Excellency.
Your Grace, what preparations
are made for our visit to York?
Majesty,
chambers are being made ready
in the former abbey of St. Mary,
and furnished with your tapestries
and plate brought from London.
Tents are being erected in the Abbey
grounds to accommodate your court
and that of King James's court
when he arrives.
Good.
Sweetheart, how are you?
I am well, thank you,
Your Majesty.
I must tell your Majesty
that today I appointed a new Private
Secretary and Usher to my Chambers.
What?
Will you write letters now?
- You don't mind?
- Of course not.
I've told you.
You must do what you will.
Thank you.
Uncle.
Uncle.
Madam, your good health!
Thank you, your Grace.
Hello, Joan.
Just like old times, eh?
No.
These times is different, Francis.
You know that very well.
Just imagine, Joanie!
Our Kate, our little Katie
is Queen of England.
She's not our Kate anymore.
She belongs to him.
She belongs to the King
And don't you forget it.
Don't you ever get any ideas
into that mind of yours.
What kind of ideas?
You know very well
what I'm talking about.
Those days are over, Francis.
They're dead!
This is a good living.
This is the highest living
you or I could ever dream of!
For God's sake, don't spoil it.
Not for us and not for her!
So,
where am I to sleep?
Not here.
Not with us!
For heaven's sake,
you must ask the King's
chamberlain for a place.
Do you understand?
I suppose so.
What's that?
Just a kiss.
For old times' sake!
Who's there?
My Lord Darcy.
Your Grace.
You're dead.
Yes, but not yet at rest.
The living don't know
that the recent dead
are always around them.
We go here and there, to do penance,
to make sure our relatives are well,
while we await our second death.
Why do you appear to me?
I am among the Dead.
I have joined the ghosts
of all your victims, your Grace.
But do not grieve too much,
for they are not bitter.
Even the children think of nothing
but stopping this endless motion,
this rushing here and there,
like doubles of our earthly selves.
And when we have settled
all our accounts,
the angels will come to take us
to the place of rest.
I wish you had not bothered me.
But now I would not have you go.
I am not really here.
But I can see you
and hear you.
You are... Darcy.
I am not Darcy!
I am nothing!
If you reached out your hand
to touch me,
it would find only air.
I'm sorry that I betrayed you.
Forgive me.
Old Tom.
I can't do that.
The living are so selfish.
They can think of nothing
but themselves.

- You want to go and play?
- Yes, if it please you, sister.
One day you will be a great King.
I know you will be.
And very strong.
But also fair and merciful.
I want you to be a just ruler,
and then indeed
you shall be a great King.
Now...
go along and play.
Thank you, Elizabeth.
And God bless you!
Mr. Thomas Culpepper.
- My Lady. Yes Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
Who is that?
His name is Francis Dereham.
But where did he come from?
I knew him a long time ago.
We both lived
with the Dowager Duchess.
She wrote to me
recommending his services.
How well did you know him?
What are you trying to say?
How well did you know him?
We were children!
You were never a child.
- Ever!
- You should know!
Don't touch me!
Don't ever touch me like that!
Don't you know who I am?
Or what I could do to you?
You don't think
you're the only one, do you?
I have a store of other lovers
beside you!
Now get out!
Get out!
Your Majesty.
Your Grace!
Your Majesty
The devoted clergy
of your Majesty's Church of England,
and the nobility
and loyal gentlemen of York,
welcome you most heartily.
In gratitude for your Majesty's
gracious pardon
of our previous, and grievous, sins,
we hope your Majesty
will accept these purses of gold.
We thank your Grace.
We thank York!
Is everything prepared
for the King visit?
Yes, Your Majesty.
King James is waiting.
I have sent messages
of reassurance to him.
Why?
What is he afraid of?
Does he think
we're going to kill him?
And it's the same one?
The one who visited her at night?
To whom she was promised?
Yes, my Lady.
It's the same gentleman.
Can I interest you in this?
He has not changed much.
Was he always so familiar?
That is his way.
Lord help us.
More wine, my Lady?
- No. Thank you.
- Come on.
Just a little? One more.
I said no, Mr. Dereham.
Thank you.
Christ!
I'm going to bed.
- Your Majesty.
- Ladies?
Come, Ladies.
Ladies.
Mr. Dereham.
I don't know who you are,
but you have no right
to be so familiar with the Queen!
Or blaspheme in her presence.
Mr. Fell,
I know the Queen of England a
great deal better than you do.
- I don't think so.
- What do you mean"I don't think so"?
Her name is Katherine Howard,
and I've known her a long time.
We used to be very close.
Very close.
Good night, sweet Edward.
Lady Bryan!
Lady Bryan! Come quickly!
He has a fever. Feel his head.
- Go fetch a physician. Run!
- Yes Madam.
- Send a message to my Lord Hertford.
- Yes, my Lady.
Poor lamb!
Your behavior is a complete outrage.
I want you to promise,
that you will not speak of the Queen
in ways which offend
her proper dignity.
Her dignity!
I shall speak of her how I like.
But you must not be so familiar.
So familiar?
Believe me,
I am very familiar with her.
For God sake's, man!
Your bragging and your lies
only harm yourself.
My lies?
You think that I am lying?
Let me tell you something, Mr. Fell.
I know Katherine Howard well enough,
for I have had her by the cunt.
My God, man!
And I would know it
among a hundred others.
I want you to give him a message.
Who, your Majesty?
You know who!
Tell him...
- I must see him.
- My Lady...
Tell him there is a way
into my chamber.
Tell him to come tomorrow,
when the King is asleep.
What is it?
Some kind of tertiary fever,
my Lord Hertford.
Is he in danger?
Is his life in danger? Answer me!
If the fever persists, then perhaps.
We do have some remedies, my Lord.
Shall we tell the King?
If he felt obliged to curtail
his progress and hurry back,
only to find the Prince
quite recovered...
Apply your remedies.
For God's sake
and for the sake of peace
in this realm
don't let him die.
It's very interesting.
It's his cousin, is it not?
Your Majesty.
Good afternoon, ladies.
Your Majesty.
I am sorry, I have left you alone.
I have had much to do
with Council and other matters.
My nephew, James, King of Scots,
is due to visit here presently.
We are to sign a peace treaty.
And then we shall straight
back to London. I promise.
I am at your Majesty's command.
Always.
Now tell me,
is there any sign
that you may be with child?
Gentlemen.
I hear the King of Scotland
is coming!
York will be full of drunken Scots
with their brawny arms and togas.
What a boon for you ladies!
Sit down, Mr. Dereham.
- Did you send the message?
- Yes.
Will he come?
We knew a Scot, didn't we?
What was his name?
Do you remember?
What was it?
Manox.
You remember Manox?
Sir?
Mr. Dereham!
Joan, you must remember Manox?
I think you and he...
That's quite enough, Mr. Dereham.
Ladies.
Your Majesty.
Gentlemen.
How dare you!
I shall tell the King.
He ought to know how beggardly
his wife's servants treat her.
Damn you, Fell!
Damn you!
Mr. Dereham! Stop it!
Stop it now!
What's that, my Lord?
Oh, nothing. A trifle.
I dare say
the Earl of Surrey's "Trifles"
will someday be regarded
as some of our greatest poesy.
Then I dare say
your Grace can read it.
It's a translation, in sonnet form,
of one of Martial's epigrams.
That is, of course, the Roman poet
but that doesn't matter.
It's about...
the happy life.
The Golden Mean.
"The happy life be these, I find
"The riches left, not got with pain
"The fruitful ground;
"the quiet mind
"The equal friend;
"no grudge nor strife
"No charge of rule nor governance
"Without disease, the healthful life
"Wisdom joined with simplicity
"The night discharged of all care."
The quiet mind.
The night discharged of all care.
Wisdom joined with simplicity.
My God, how I wish
these things were true.
Which of these, your Grace,
do you not have?
All of them.
Then you are like me.
And like all the Romans.
And all the Barbarians.
And all the generations before us...
And all those yet to come.
For who does not wish,
or rest, with all their heart
for the quiet mind?
Tell me a single soul
who has ever found it?
You've changed your mind, then?
No, no.
I love you.
I told you.
I long for nothing so much
as to see you.
It makes my heart die
when I can't see you.
I love you, too.
But this Dereham
you have to get rid of him.
Yes, I know. And I will.
I promise.
When we get back to London.
You're not still angry with me?
Please don't be angry with me.
I want to be at your commandment.
You know what I want.
Do it!
That's it.
Ah, yes. That's it, my sweet.
My own sweet little fool.
Your Majesty's gift
to the King of Scotland.
Well! What do you
have to say? Speak!
Majesty,
the King is not coming.
He has gone back to Edinburgh.
But worse! O that God
could forgive them!
A Scottish army has ridden
over the border and is harrying
our people, spoiling fields,
burning barns,
and killing all those
who oppose them.
Sir Thomas!
Majesty.
Order our troops to retaliate,
with spoils, burnings and killings.
Three hurts to every one of ours.
Do you understand?
Yes, your Majesty.
I am straight away to that business.
Majesty.
What do you want? Speak
or I will cut out your tongue!
I am to tell you that your son,
Prince Edward,
is dangerously ill at Windsor.
Your Majesty.
Blessed Father, have mercy
on my brother Edward.
<i>Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris Filim.</i>
Father.
My Lord,
send for the Bishop of London.
Tell him to prepare a special Mass
in the Chapel Royal,
to give thanks to God
for my son and for my wife.
Yes, your Majesty.
In the name of the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost.
On this Day of All Saints,
his Majesty wishes to thank God
for blessing him
with so perfect a companion...
as Queen Katherine.
In his Majesty's own words:
"I render thanks to Thee, O Lord,"
"that after so many
strange accidents
"that have befallen my marriages,
"though has been pleased
to give me a wife
"so entirely conformed
to my inclinations as her
"I now have."
<i>Gaudeamus omnes in Domino,</i>
<i>diem festum celebrantes</i>
<i>sub honore sanctorum omnium...</i>
<i>Précédemment...</i>
Voici mon épouse,
la reine Katherine.
<i>Il est incroyable
qu'un tel joyau de féminité</i>
<i>me témoigne un amour si parfait.</i>
<i>Je vous exhorte à la prudence.</i>
<i>Lady Rochford,</i>
je sais comment batifoler
avec un homme.
Vous haïssez mon frère.
Si seulement vous étiez
comme lui, Sir Thomas.
Mon mari obtient toujours
ce qu'il veut.
C'est bien lui ?
Vous comprenez bien que
je ne peux rien vous proposer.
- Vous avez employé Joan Bulmer.
- Je ne le peux.
Vous le pouvez, Votre Majesté.
Elle s'appelle Katherine Howard.
Je l'ai bien connue.
Nous étions très proches.
Très proches.
J'ai nommé mon nouveau
secrétaire et majordome.
- Cela vous dérange ?
- Non.
Faites à votre guise.
Madame, à votre santé.
Je dois le voir.
Qui, Majesté ?
- Culpepper.
- My lady.
Dites-lui de venir
quand le roi dormira.
Ce Dereham, vous devez le renvoyer.
Je le ferai.
<i>Vous le savez, je vous aime.</i>
Vous n'avez pas le droit
d'être aussi familier avec la reine.
Le roi doit savoir
comment son épouse est traitée.
Allez au diable, Fell !
Sa Majesté remercie Dieu
de l'avoir dotée d'une épouse
si parfaite, la reine Katherine.
Je te rends grâce, Seigneur,
de m'avoir donné une épouse
telle que Katherine.

- Que dit cette lettre ?
- Votre Majesté l'a lue...
Dites-moi ce qui est écrit,
Lord Hertford.
La lettre accuse la reine
d'avoir eu une vie dissolue
avant d'épouser Votre Majesté,
lorsqu'elle vivait
chez la duchesse douairière.
Il y avait deux hommes.
Un professeur de musique,
Henry Manox,
et un certain Francis Dereham.
Sa conduite n'était pas un secret.
Les gens savaient.
Qui a écrit la lettre ?
Elle est anonyme.
Celui qui l'a écrite
dit n'avoir pas eu le courage
de vous parler.
- C'est un mensonge.
- Oui, Votre Majesté.
Ces accusations sont
volontairement malveillantes.
Les calomnies visent souvent
les gens illustres.
- Oui, Majesté.
- Néanmoins,
je vous charge d'enquêter
plus avant.
Vous devez découvrir
toute la vérité.
La reine sera confinée
dans ses appartements,
avec la seule compagnie
de Lady Rochford,
en attendant d'être disculpée.
Non, l'autre main.
Quoi ?
Sergent ? Qu'y a-t-il ?
Madame, vous êtes confinée ici,
avec Lady Rochford pour vous servir,
tant qu'il plaira au roi.
Katherine,
ne les laissez pas m'emmener.
Pourquoi ?
Dois-je rester ici ?
Expliquez-moi. Je ne comprends pas.
Désormais, un garde
sera posté derrière la porte.
Ayez pitié.
Francis Dereham, je vous arrête.
Pour quelle raison ?
Pourquoi, je vous prie ?
Je vais vous poser des questions
au sujet de ce qui s'est passé
à Lambeth,
entre Katherine Howard
et deux messieurs.
Henry Manox.
Francis Dereham.
Vous savez de quoi je parle.
Vous n'avez rien à craindre,
madame Bulmer,
on ne vous fera aucun mal.
À condition de dire la vérité.
Est-ce clair ?
Cet homme, Henry Manox,
était professeur de musique.
Avez-vous vu,
ou entendu dire
qu'il prenait certaines libertés
avec Katherine Howard ?
Oui, monsieur.
Il m'a dit qu'il l'aimait.
J'ai répondu
que si Lady de Norfolk
apprenait qu'ils s'aimaient,
elle s'y opposerait.
Car elle est noble,
et s'il l'épousait,
son sang pourrait le tuer.
Et qu'a dit Manox ?
Il a dit : "Tais-toi, femme !"
"Je n'ai pas l'intention
de l'épouser."
"Je suis certain
de parvenir à mes fins."
Elle lui a dit
qu'il pourrait avoir sa virginité,
même si cela était douloureux,
car il serait reconnaissant.
A-t-il eu...
sa virginité ?
Non, car elle s'est mise
à fréquenter quelqu'un d'autre.
Et ce quelqu'un serait
Francis Dereham ?
Oui, Messire.
Connaissiez-vous Katherine Howard,
quand elle avait 14 ou 15 ans ?
Oui.
Aviez-vous
des relations charnelles ?
Nous...
jouions à des jeux.
Nous prétendions être mariés.
Cela l'amusait.
Aviez-vous des rapports charnels ?
Vous devriez savoir
que nous avons parlé aux dames
qui partageaient sa chambre.
Elles vous ont vu vous glisser
dans le lit de la reine.
- Elle n'était pas reine.
- Répondez-moi.
Aviez-vous des rapports charnels
avec Katherine Howard ?
Non !
Je ne crois pas que vous
ayez été honnête avec moi.
Je voulais vous montrer ce qui attend
les gens malhonnêtes,
qui ne disent pas la vérité.
Je vais tout vous dire.
Des accusations
sont portées contre la reine.
De quelle nature ?
Frivolité, immoralité et débauche...
avec des hommes,
avant son arrivée à la cour.
Je ne peux le croire.
Mais, puisqu'on l'accuse,
je dois connaître les faits.
Tant que l'investigation
est en cours,
soyez discret.
Aucun scandale
ne doit entacher son nom.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
J'ai un bon jeu.
Que savent-ils ?
Pourquoi sommes-nous gardées ainsi ?
Je l'ignore.
Quelqu'un a dû leur parler.
Qui ?
Que leur a-t-il dit ?
Que leur a-t-il dit ?
Pourquoi pleurez-vous ainsi ?
Cela ne vous concerne pas.
Il faut que je lui parle.
Je dois parler au roi.
Il comprendra.
Nous avons des preuves
que Katherine Howard
vous a offert une chaîne en or
et un chapeau.
Pourquoi vous les a-t-elle achetés ?
Elle m'aimait.
Elle vous aimait ?
Oui, My Lord.
Elle a dit : "Je vous promets
de vous aimer de tout mon cœur."
Elle a promis par son engagement
qu'elle me prendrait pour mari.
Vous aviez un pré-contrat ?
Oui, Monsieur.
Il était acquis
que nous nous marierions.
C'est pourquoi...
Vous l'avez donc connue intimement.
Oui, Monsieur.
Nous ne pensions pas à mal.
Nous allions devenir mari et femme.
Nous nous étions promis devant Dieu.
Pourquoi ne pas l'avoir épousée ?
J'ai quitté Lambeth pour l'Irlande,
pendant un moment.
À mon retour,
Katherine était déjà à la cour.
La Reine vous a récemment repris
à son service.
Pourquoi ?
La Duchesse Douairière
a eu l'amabilité de louer mes talents.
Vous avez reconnu
avoir connu intimement la Reine
avant son mariage avec le Roi.
Mais cela s'est-il reproduit
depuis ?
Non, Monsieur ! Non !
Sur mon honneur !
Sur votre honneur, M. Dereham ?
Son Excellence est ici.
Eustace ! Je vous en prie.
Asseyez-vous.
Merci Lady Mary.
Vous êtes très aimable.
Je devais vous voir.
Il y a beaucoup de rumeurs
à la cour.
Il semble que la Reine
est cloîtrée dans ses appartements.
- Pourquoi ?
- Personne ne le sait.
Mais les rumeurs parlent
de son inconduite.
Je le savais.
C'est une jeune femme légère
qui ne se consacre qu'à la luxure.
Il est navrant que les Howard
soient une grande famille catholique.
Non,
il est navrant que Katherine Howard
n'ait jamais été une bonne catholique,
ni même une bonne épouse.
Et encore moins une Reine !
Alors ?
Katherine Howard
était une jeune libertine.
Vous le saviez sûrement !
J'avais entendu qu'elle avait reçu
une éducation peu conventionnelle.
Je ne savais pas à quel point.
Je n'avais pas soupçonné qu'à 14 ans,
elle couchait avec deux hommes.
Vous l'avez rencontrée !
Vous avez vu son regard.
Elle n'a jamais été innocente.
Et qui est innocent, ma chérie ?
Qu'a avoué Dereham ?
Seulement qu'il avait couché
avec la reine avant son mariage.
Vous le croyez ?
Je l'ignore.
Je vais lui redemander.
Vous devez être prudent, mon mari.
Souvenez-vous que vous êtes de ceux
qui ont offert Katherine au Roi.
Pensez-vous que je l'ai oublié ?
C'est pourquoi
je dois être encore plus dur avec elle.
Puisque j'ai été le plus dupé.
Je vais dormir.
J'ai à faire le matin.
Je vous souhaite
à tous les trois
une bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit, mon frère.
Alors...
Comment va-t-on appeler votre enfant,
Thomas ?
Sir Edward.
Pouvez-vous me dire ce qui se passe ?
Je vous en prie, on ne me dit rien.
Je vous en prie.
Madame,
j'ai interdiction de vous parler.
Non, vous devez me parler.
- Madame, je ne peux pas. Sur ma vie !
- Au moins une chose !
Pourquoi suis-je maintenue ici ?
Qu'a-t-il été dit ?
Dereham est à la Tour.
Ainsi que certaines suivantes
ayant servi la Duchesse Douairière.
Mon Dieu.
Je ne sais rien d'autre.
Veuillez m'excuser, Madame.
Je ne peux en dire plus.
Sa Majesté le Roi.
Votre Majesté.
Votre Grâce ?
Votre Majesté,
My Lord Hertford,
et d'autres conseillers,
ont mené une enquête approfondie
au sujet de...
l'inconduite de la Reine.
Et ?
Votre Majesté,
je dois dire à Votre Majesté,
qu'après mon enquête préliminaire,
nous pensons que les allégations
contre la Reine
semblent fondées.
La Reine a reçu les attentions
de son maître de musique, Henry Manox,
quand elle vivait
avec la Duchesse Douairière de Norfolk.
Manox a juré sous serment
ne jamais avoir pris sa virginité.
Mais celle-ci a été offerte
à un dénommé Francis Dereham.
Il est prouvé
qu'ils ont passé des nuits ensemble...
nus.
Dereham prétend avoir eu
un pré-contrat avec la Reine,
qu'il n'a pas fauté,
en ayant eu des relations intimes.
Et que leur liaison était finie
à son départ pour l'Irlande
et celui de la Reine pour la cour.
Malheureusement...
la Reine Katherine
a pris à son service ce même Dereham
pendant le dernier voyage
de Votre Majesté,
comme secrétaire privé
et majordome.
Je dois vous dire
qu'elle vous a trahi en pensées,
si elle en avait eu l'opportunité,
elle vous aurait trahi dans les faits.
Sir Thomas ?
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Madame, je suis venu vous dire
qu'à cause de vos offenses
envers le Roi,
tous vos domestiques
ont été renvoyés.
Vos coffres seront scellés
et placés sous bonne garde.
Je suis ici
pour récupérer vos bijoux
et les rapporter à Sa Majesté.
Je vous en prie,
où est le Roi ?
Je dois le voir.
Je dois vous dire
que le Roi et son Conseil
ont ordonné que, pour vos offenses,
vous perdiez le titre de Reine,
et soyez Lady Katherine Howard.
Vous allez à l'abbaye de Syon
et y resterez au gré du Roi.
Où est le Roi ?
Je dois lui parler.
Vous ne comprenez pas.
Je dois lui parler.
Tout s'arrangera.
Ne comprenez-vous pas ?
Tout s'arrangera.
Il est à la chapelle.
Mais je doute qu'il vous parle.
Arrêtez-la ! Gardes !
Katherine Howard ! Arrêtez-la !
Katherine Howard ! Arrêtez !
Vous êtes aux arrêts !
Arrêtez, Katherine Howard !
Votre Majesté !
Je dois vous parler.
Je vous en prie.
Pitié, Votre Majesté !
Pitié, c'est moi, Katherine !
C'est Katherine.
C'est Katherine. Pitié.
Henry ! Henry, pitié !
Non ! Votre Majesté !
Non, pitié !
Henry ! Non, je vous en prie !
Je vous en prie, Henry !
Risley.
Risley !
- Majesté.
- Allez chercher l'évêque Gardiner.
- Je dois lui parler.
- Oui, Votre Majesté.
Pourquoi faites-vous ça ?
Pourquoi faites-vous ça ?
Je vous ai dit
tout ce que je savais !
Ses mains, mes chéris. Ses mains.
Pourquoi me faites-vous ça ?
Non ! Non !
Votre Grâce.
Je dois prévenir Votre Grâce
que depuis son arrivée
la pauvre créature,
est dans un état de lamentation
et d'accablement
que je n'ai jamais vus auparavant.
Elle délire parfois,
au point que j'ai dû enlever
tout ce qui pourrait la blesser.
Lady Katherine !
Lady Katherine !
Le Cardinal Gardiner est là.
Lady Katherine, ne pleurez pas,
car j'ai avec moi
une lettre de Sa Majesté
qui vous offre
son pardon bienveillant.
Madame, le Roi vous pardonne.
Quoi ?
Que dites-vous ?
La lettre de Sa Majesté.
Il vous y offre son pardon,
malgré...
vos graves offenses contre lui,
si vous reconnaissez vos fautes
publiquement.
Voilà.
Vous voyez ?
Je remercie humblement le Roi,
qui me montre plus de bienveillance
que je n'en espérais.
Mais d'abord,
je dois vous interroger.
Et vous devez répondre
loyalement et honnêtement
comme au jour du Jugement dernier.
Katherine !
Le Roi vous tend la main en pardon.
Il n'y a pas à avoir peur.
Venez, asseyez-vous.
Hélas,
My Lord, je suis vivante !
La peur de la mort
ne me peine pas autant
que le souvenir de la bonté du Roi.
Je me souviens quel gracieux
et bon prince j'avais,
je ne peux m'empêcher de pleurer.
Mais ce soudain pardon,
plus que je n'espérais,
me fait apparaître mes offenses
plus graves qu'avant.
Reconnaissez-vous
que Francis Dereham
visitait souvent
votre lit à Lambeth ?
Oui, my Lord.
Il a dormi avec moi,
parfois en pourpoint et caleçon
et parfois nu,
mais pas si nu
qu'il n'ait rien sur lui,
il avait toujours
son pourpoint, mais
nu quand il enlevait son caleçon.
Pour avoir
des relations charnelles ?
Y avait-il un pré-contrat
entre vous ?
Deviez-vous vous l'épouser ?
Il m'appelait parfois "femme",
et je l'appelais "époux".
Mais pas de contrat.
S'il y en avait un,
votre mariage avec le Roi
serait nul,
vous devriez affronter la honte...
mais ne perdriez pas la vie.
Il me promettait de m'aimer
de tout son cœur.
Ce n'était pas un contrat.
Dereham a-t-il couché avec vous
alors que vous étiez Reine ?
Non, My Lord. Jamais.
Je vais rentrer
et rédiger
une demande de pardon
que je soumettrai au Roi.
Attendez !
J'ai des choses importantes
à vous dire.
My Lady ?
Je n'ai jamais été consentante.
Il a utilisé la force contre moi.
D'une façon...
violente.
Il vous a violée ?
La Reine a avoué ?
Elle dit que Dereham l'a violée.
Je suis certain qu'elle ment,
pour autre chose aussi.
Mais je crois qu'il y avait
une espèce de pré-contrat
entre eux,
ce qui rend le mariage nul.
Elle prétend être innocente
après le mariage ?
Bien sûr.
- Et vous la croyez ?
- Pas vous ?
Je ne crois rien
de ce que dit Dereham.
Ce ne serait pas lui.
Que veut dire Votre Grâce ?
Vous avez les aveux de la Reine ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Elle implore Votre pardon.
Elle reconnaît
avoir été si désireuse
de vos faveurs, si aveuglée
de désir de gloire,
qu'elle n'a pas compris
la grande faute
de Vous cacher ses fautes passées.
"Considérant que je voulais
"toute ma vie
"être franche et loyale
à Votre Majesté".
- Peut-on annuler le mariage ?
- Ce serait le mieux.
Je pense que vous avez couché
avec la Reine après son mariage.
Je vous en prie, c'est faux !
Car un autre m'avait supplanté
dans son affection.
Qui ?
Thomas Culpepper.
Thomas Culpepper ?
Le majordome ?
Oui, monsieur.
À quel point avez-vous connu
Thomas Culpepper ?
Plutôt bien.
J'ai flirté avec lui,
l'ai rencontré dans les escaliers
et lui ai offert des cadeaux.
Il m'appelait sa "petite sotte".
Avez-vous commis l'adultère
avec lui ?
Non, My Lord. Jamais
bien que...
Lady Rochford m'y ait poussée.
Lady Rochford vous y poussait ?
En effet.
Puis elle a répandu la rumeur
que nous étions amants,
ce qui est faux.
Niez-vous avoir rencontré la Reine
- en secret en de multiples occasions ?
- Non, My Lord.
Mais vous niez avoir commis
l'adultère avec elle ?
En effet.
Nous n'avons pas dépassé les mots.
Si vous me mentez, M. Culpepper,
vous serez torturé pour avouer.
Je vous dis la vérité.
Pour autant, j'en aurais voulu plus.
J'avais l'intention d'en faire plus
avec la Reine et elle avec moi.
Mon Dieu.
Rien que l'intention en elle-même
constitue une haute trahison.
Mais c'est...
Katherine qui m'y a incité.
Elle le voulait, moi pas.
Et... sa servante, Lady Rochford,
l'a provoqué
et a agi comme une entremetteuse,
comme la tenancière d'un bordel !
Pourquoi m'accusent-ils ?
Ce n'est pas ma faute.
Je devais monter la garde
quand ils se voyaient,
ou même dans son boudoir.
Je ne voulais pas.
Je n'aimais pas ça.
Une fois, j'ai même dû empêcher
le Roi d'entrer dans la chambre,
car Culpepper y était déjà.
Pensez-vous qu'ils couchaient
ensemble ces fois-là ?
Je ne peux pas penser le contraire,
avec ce que j'ai vu et entendu.
Garde !
Vais-je mourir, my Lord ?
Vais-je mourir ?
Gardien, ouvrez.
Votre Majesté m'a demandé au début,
de ne pas arrêter avant
d'aller au fond de l'affaire.
Majesté,
je crains de déjà racler le fond,
et un compagnon de Votre Majesté,
un homme de confiance,
a certainement trahi Votre Majesté
en commettant l'adultère
avec la Reine.
Qui est-ce ?
Votre majordome, Thomas Culpepper.
Ils démentent tous les deux
les accusations,
mais aucun ne dément
les rencontres secrètes
dans les escaliers
ou dans le boudoir
durant Votre dernier voyage.
Lady Rochford et d'autres suivantes
ont fourni
des preuves
de leurs nombreuses rencontres.
Cette lettre a été découverte
dans les quartiers de M. Culpepper.
Écrite par la Reine.
Elle écrit :
"Mon cœur se brise à l'idée
"de ne pouvoir être
en votre compagnie."
"J'ai su que vous étiez malade
"et je me languis de vous voir."
Et c'est signé :
"Éternellement vôtre
"Katherine."
Ce qui est arrivé
est de votre faute !
Votre faute !
Vous m'avez encouragé à l'épouser !
Quelle infortune d'avoir eu autant
de mauvaises épouses !
Je jure que tout le plaisir
que cette sale garce a pu connaître
dans la débauche ne sera rien,
mais rien,
par rapport à sa douleur
entre les mains du bourreau !
Beau travail, ma femme.
Nous le nommerons ?
Thomas.
Très bien.
Ce sera Thomas.
Vous avez d'autres questions
pour Lady Rochford ?
- Oui.
- Ça ne sert à rien, Sir Thomas.
Lady Rochford a perdu la raison.
Mort à vous !
Vous voilà.
Majesté ? Sa Grâce,
le Duc de Suffolk.
Vous n'avez jamais lu la Bible,
Charles ?
Non, Majesté.
J'ai toujours laissé d'autres
plus cultivés que moi me la lire.
Dans ce cas, vous avez manqué
bien des vérités.
Comme celle-ci,
dans le livre de Salomon :
"Car les lèvres de l'étrangère
distillent le miel.
"Et son palais
est plus doux que l'huile.
"Mais à la fin,
"elle est amère comme l'absinthe,
aiguë comme un glaive
à deux tranchants."
Pourquoi êtes-vous là ?
- Le roi François a envoyé une lettre.
- Que dit-elle ?
"Je suis désolé d'apprendre
les désagréments causés
par le comportement lubrique
de la reine.
"Mais sachant que mon frère est
un prince prudent et honorable,
"Je lui demande de surmonter
ce mécontentement
"et sagement, calmement,
comme moi-même,
"de ne pas laisser son honneur
reposer sur une femme,
"mais de remercier Dieu,
et de se réconforter dans Sa bonté.
"La légèreté des femmes ne peut
dominer l'honneur des hommes."
Dites à François d'aller...
Dites à Sa Majesté
que nous sommes reconnaissants
de sa sollicitude.
- Oui, Majesté.
- Pour Dereham et Culpepper ?
- Ils ont été accusés de trahison ?
- Ils ont été jugés ensemble.
À la dernière minute, Culpepper
a plaidé coupable,
ils ont été condamnés.
Ils doivent être pendus
et écartelés ensemble à Tyburn.
Dites au juge
de faire décapiter Culpepper.
Je hais plus Dereham,
parce qu'il a défloré la Reine.
Et pour Lady Rochford ?
Elle a été reconnue coupable
de trahison
mais elle est folle :
elle ne peut être exécutée.
Dites à Richard Rich
de faire voter une loi
légalisant l'exécution
d'un aliéné pour trahison.
Compris ?
Oui, Majesté.
Vous êtes de ceux qui m'ont fait
rencontrer Katherine Howard.
Vous le regrettez ?
Majesté.
Vous devriez avoir honte !
Traître !
" Maître Culpepper,
"je me rappelle à vous,
" priant que vous me donniez
de vos nouvelles.
"J'ai su que vous étiez malade,
"et je me languis de vous voir.
"J'aimerais être avec vous
pour que vous voyiez
"le soin que je prends
à vous écrire.
"Mon cœur se brise à l'idée
"de ne pouvoir être
en votre compagnie."
Je vous supplie de prier pour moi.
"Dereham m'a donné
"beaucoup de gages d'amour.
"Il connaissait une petite bossue
à Londres,
"qui fabriquait des fleurs en soie,
"et qui lui a fait un fenouillet
pour me l'offrir.
"Et plus tard une pensée sauvage
pour le Nouvel An,
"et du taffetas,
que j'ai utilisé pour un chapeau.
"Il m'appelait "ma femme",
"et touchait les parties
intimes de mon corps.
"Je me rapelles lui avoir
donné un col et des manches.
"Et un jour,
"il m'a chipé un bracelet en argent
en disant :
"Tiens, ma femme,
un cadeau pour moi."
"Et il m'embrassait souvent,
et si passionnément
"que tous disaient qu'il ne pouvait pas
cesser de m'embrasser."
Katherine Howard,
vous êtes accusée d'avoir eu de vils
rapports charnels et voluptueux
avant le mariage,
- telle une vulgaire catin
- Avec plusieurs hommes.
Vous vous êtes fait aimer
par le Roi,
en cachant votre contrat
avec Francis Dereham
au péril du Roi et des enfants
que vous lui auriez donné.
Et après le mariage,
vous avez fait bénéficier
Dereham de vos faveurs,
tout en incitant Thomas Culpepper...
au plaisir,
lui disant
que vous l'aimiez plus que le Roi.
Il est de mon devoir...
de vous escorter à la Tour.
Ne les laissez pas.
Mon Dieu !
Est-elle condamnée ?
Oui, Majesté.
Et les autres ?
Dereham et Culpepper
ont été exécutés
et la loi autorisant l'exécution
d'un aliéné
a été promulguée.
Je veux faire une fête.
- Voici une liste des invités.
- Oui, Majesté.
Katherine Howard, je dois
vous annoncer que vous allez mourir.
Vous serez emmenée demain matin,
le 13 février,
escortée par les membres du Conseil.
Puis-je avoir une faveur ?
M'apporterez-vous le billot
pour que je sache comment m'y placer
et...
l'essayer ?
Comme vous voulez.
Avez-vous besoin d'autre chose ?
Un confesseur ?

J'ai si rarement parlé à Dieu
que je ne pensais pas
qu'Il me connaissait.
Mesdames.
Une douceur ?
Qu'en pensez-vous, Majesté ?
Une belle Reine.
Madame. Voulez-vous
dire quelques mots ?
Je...
demande le pardon pour mes péchés,
à Sa Gracieuse Majesté,
à Dieu,
et à vous tous.
Dois-je en dire plus ?
Non, Madame.
C'est déjà assez.
Merci.
C'est l'heure.
Je suis venue ici pour mourir.
Je meurs en Reine.
Mais j'aurais préféré mourir
en tant que femme de Culpepper.
La vie est...
très belle.

<i>Previously on The Tudors...</i>
Allow me to introduce my wife,
Queen Katherine.
<i>It seems incredible to have obtained
such a perfect jewel of womanhood</i>
<i>who bears towards me
such perfect love.</i>
<i>I urge Your Majesty to be careful.</i>
<i>What, Lady Rochford?</i>
Don't you think I know
how to meddle with a man?
You hate my brother.
If only you could be
more like him, Sir Thomas.
My husband always takes
what he wants.
It is him, isn't it?
Surely you can understand
why I cannot offer you anything.
- But you employed Joan Bulmer.
- I can't!
But you can, Your Majesty.
Her name is Katherine Howard,
and I've known her a long time.
We used to be very close.
Very close.
Today I appointed a new usher
to my chambers.
- You don't mind?
- Of course not.
You must do as you will.
Madam, your good health.
I must see him.
Who, Your Majesty?
- Culpepper.
- My lady.
Tell him to come when
the King is asleep.
This Dereham,
you have to get rid of him.
I will, I promise.
<i>I told you, I love you.</i>
You must not be so familiar
with the Queen of England.
The King ought to know how beggarly
his wife's servants treat her.
Damn you Fell! Damn you!
His Majesty wishes to thank God
for blessing him with so perfect
a companion as Queen Katherine.
I render thanks to Thee, oh Lord.
You hast been pleased
to give me a wife

- What does this letter say?
- I thought Your Majesty just read...
I asked you to tell me
what this letter says, My Lord Hertford.
The letter accuses Queen
Katherine of dissolute living
before she was married
to Your Majesty,
while she was living with
the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.
There was two men.
A music teacher named Henry Manox,
and a gentleman
called Francis Dereham.
And that her way of life
was not a secret,
that many knew of it.
Who wrote the letter?
It is not signed.
Whoever left it says he only wrote it
because he did not have the heart
to tell you by mouth.
- It's a forgery!
- Yes, Your Majesty.
The accusations in this letter
are maliciously intended.
Many calumnies are published
about well-known persons.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Nevertheless,
I charge you to investigate
the matter thoroughly.
Do not desist until you have
reached to the bottom of the pot.
The Queen shall be confined
to her apartments,
with only Lady Rochford
in attendance,
until her name is cleared.
My Lord.
Majesty.
Your Majesty.
No, the other hand.
What?
Sergeant? What is this?
My Lady, you are confined
to your apartments,
with only Lady Rochford
to attend you,
for as long as it please the King.
Please, Katherine,
don't let them take me!
Joan! Joan!
Why?
Why must I stay here?
Please tell me.
I don't understand.
Forgive me, but from now on, there will
be a guard posted beyond the door.
Please.
Francis Dereham,
you are under arrest.
Under arrest for what?
For what, I ask you?
I want to ask you some questions
about what went on
some years ago at Lambeth,
between Katherine Howard,
as she then was, and two men,
Henry Manox...
and Francis Dereham.
You know what I'm talking
about, don't you?
There's no need to be afraid,
Mistress Bulmer.
No harm will come to you,
so long as you tell me the truth!
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
I understand that this man,
Henry Manox, was a music teacher.
Did you ever
see him or...
hear of him taking liberties
with Katherine Howard?
Yes, sir.
He told me he was in love with her.
But I told him,
I said if my lady knew of the love
between him and Mistress Howard,
she would undo him, because...
she is from a noble house,
and if you marry her,
some of her blood will kill you.
And what did Manox say?
He said, "Hold your peace, woman!"
"My designs are
of a dishonest kind."
"I doubt not
I shall achieve my purpose."
She said to him
that he would have her maidenhead,
though it be painful to her,
knowing he'd be good
to her afterwards.
And did he...
have her maidenhead?
No, sir, for she started
seeing someone else.
And would that man be
Francis Dereham?
Yes, my Lord.
Did you know Katherine Howard
at Lambeth,
when she was 14 or 15 years old?
Yes, sir.
Did you have carnal
knowledge of her?
We...
played some games.
We pretended to be man and wife.
It amused her.
Did you know her carnally?
You should know, Mr. Dereham,
that we have spoken to some of the maids
who used to sleep in the same dormitory.
They say that you crept into
the Queen's bed for a hundred nights.
- She was not the Queen.
- Let me ask again.
Did you have carnal knowledge
of Katherine Howard?
No!
I thought you were not altogether
honest with me, Mr. Dereham.
I wanted to show you what we do
to people who are dishonest,
who don't tell the truth.
I'll tell you the truth.
Certain accusations have been
made against the Queen.
What kind of accusations?
That she was light,
immoral, dissolute...
with certain men...
before she came to court.
I can't believe it to be true.
But since the accusations are made,
I must know all the facts.
But since this inquisition
is in progress,
be careful who you speak to.
I'll have no spark of scandal
against her name.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I have a good hand.
What do they know?
Why have I been confined like this?
I don't know.
Someone has told them something!
Who?
What has he told them?
What has he told them?
Why are you crying like this?
It's not about you!
I have to speak to him.
I have to speak to the King.
He'll understand.
We have some evidence
that Katherine Howard
gave you a gold chain
and rich cap as a gift.
Why did she buy you such gifts?
Because she loved me.
Loved you?
Yes, my Lord.
She told me: "I promise you
I do love you with all my heart."
She promised by her faith and troth
that she would take
no other husband but me.
You were pre-contracted then?
Yes, sir.
It was understood between us
that we would get married.
That's why...
That's why you knew her carnally?
Yes, sir.
We weren't doing anything wrong.
She was going to be my wife
and I her husband.
We'd made promises before God.
Why did you not marry her, then?
I left Lambeth for a while
and went to Ireland.
When I returned,
Katherine was already at court.
The Queen recently took you back
into her employment.
On what grounds?
The Dowager Duchess was kind enough
to speak highly of my talents.
You have admitted to the fact that you
had carnal knowledge of the Queen
before her marriage to the King.
But did you also know her
carnally afterwards?
No, sir! No! On my honour!
On your honour, Mr. Dereham?
My Lady?
His Excellency is here.
Eustace! Please, sit.
Thank you, Lady Mary.
You are too gracious.
I had to see you.
There are many rumours at court.
And it seems the Queen
has been confined to her apartments.
- Why?
- Nobody knows.
But the rumours
speak of her misconduct.
I knew it.
I knew she was always a light young
woman, dedicated only to pleasure.
And the sad fact is, Lady Mary, that
the Howards are a great Catholic family.
No,
the sad fact is that Katherine Howard
was never a good Catholic,
nor ever a good wife.
Nor even less a Queen!
What have you discovered?
Katherine Howard was
a loose young woman.
You surely knew that!
I was told that her upbringing
had been unconventional.
I didn't know how unconventional.
I didn't suspect that at 14 years old
she was sleeping with two older men!
You met her!
You saw the look in her eyes.
She was never innocent.
And who is innocent, my sweetheart?
What did Dereham confess?
Only that he'd slept with the Queen
before she was married.
Do you believe him?
I don't know. I may ask again.
Husband, you must be careful.
If you remember,
you were among those
who offered Katherine up
to the King.
Do you suppose I ever forget that?
But that's why I must be harder
on her than anyone else.
Since I was the most deceived.
I must to bed.
I have things to do in the morning.
I bid thee,
all three of thee, good night.
Good night, brother.
So...
What shall we call
your child, Thomas?
Sir Edward,
can you not tell me what's happening?
I beg you, no one tells me anything.
Please, please.
Madam, I am forbidden
to talk to you.
No, no. You must speak to me.
- Madam, I can't. On my life!
- Just something!
Why am I confined here?
What has anyone said?
They have taken Dereham
to the Tower.
Also some of the maids
who attended the Dowager Duchess.
My God.
That's all I know.
Madam, you will have to excuse me.
I can say no more.
His Majesty the King.
Your Majesty.
Your Grace?
Your Majesty,
my Lord Hertford,
and other Councillors,
have made diligent inquiries
into the question of the...
misconduct of the Queen.
And?
Your Majesty-
I have to tell Your Majesty that even
from my preliminary investigations,
we believe the allegations
against Queen Katherine
have a sound basis in fact...
The Queen received the attentions
of her music master, Henry Manox
when she lived
with the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.
Manox swears under oath
that she never gave him her maidenhead.
But that instead it was given
to a man called Francis Dereham.
There is ample proof that they spent
many nights together...
naked.
Dereham claims that he was
pre-contracted to the Queen,
so he did no wrong by having
carnal relations with her,
and that their relationship
was over when he left for Ireland
and the Queen
for Your Majesty's court.
Unfortunately...
Queen Katherine took this same Dereham
back into her employment
during Your Majesty's late progress,
appointing him her personal
secretary and usher.
I have to say that she has
betrayed you in thought,
and if she had an opportunity,
would have betrayed you in deed.
My Lady.
Sir Thomas?
What is it?
Madam,
I have come to tell you that,
for your offences against the King,
all your household
has been discharged.
Your coffers and chests will be
sealed and placed under guard,
and I am also come here
to collect all your jewels
and return them to His Majesty.
Please, sir Thomas,
where is the King?
I must see him.
Madam, I must tell you
that the King and his Council
have ordained that, for your offences,
you have forfeited
the title of Queen,
and must be known
as Lady Katherine Howard.
You will be taken
to Syon Abbey today,
to wait upon the King's
further pleasure.
Where is the King?
I need to speak to him.
You don't understand.
I have to speak to him.
Then everything will be all right.
Don't you understand?
Everything will be all right.
His Majesty is at Chapel.
But I fear he will not speak to you.
Lady Katherine!
Stop her! Guards!
Katherine Howard! Stop her!
Katherine Howard! Stop!
You are arrested. Stop!
Do not proceed, Katherine Howard!
Your Majesty!
I must speak to you. Please.
Please, Your Majesty!
Please, it's me, Katherine!
It's Katherine.
It's Katherine. Please.
Please.
Henry! Henry, please!
No! Your Majesty!
No, please!
Henry! No, please! Please, Henry!
Risley. Risley!
Majesty.
Go and fetch Bishop Gardiner.
- I must speak to him.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
I've already told you
everything I know!
His hands, my loves. His hands.
What are you going to do to me?
No! No!
Your Grace.
I must warn Your Grace-
that the poor creature,
ever since she came here,
has been in such lamentation
and heaviness
that I never saw in any creature.
Sometimes in a frenzy,
that I had to remove every implement
that might have harmed her.
Lady Katherine!
Lady Katherine!
Bishop Gardiner is come to see you.
Lady Katherine, do not weep,
for I am come here with a
letter from His Majesty
which offers you his
most gracious mercy.
Madam, the King offers you mercy.
What?
What did you say?
Here is His Majesty's letter.
In it, he offers you mercy,
despite the...
the grievous offences
you have committed against him,
if you will only openly
confess your faults.
There.
You see?
I humbly thank the King,
who has shown me
more grace and mercy
than I could have hoped for.
But, first,
I must ask you some questions.
And you must answer as
truthfully and honestly as you will
reply at the Day of Judgment.
Katherine!
The King offers his hand in mercy.
There is nothing to
be frightened of.
Come! Sit down.
Alas,
My Lord, that I am alive!
The fear of death
does not grieve me as much
as the remembrance
of the King's goodness,
for when I remember
how gracious and loving a Prince
I had, I cannot but sorrow.
But this sudden mercy,
more than I could have looked for,
makes my offences appear to my eyes
more heinous than they did before.
You confess that
this Francis Dereham
came often to your bed at Lambeth?
Yes, my Lord.
He has lain with me,
sometimes in his doublet and hose,
and sometimes naked,
but I mean, not so naked
that he had nothing upon him,
for he had always
his doublet on; but I mean
naked when his hose was pulled down.
In order to know you carnally?
Was there a pre-contract
between you?
Did you intend to marry him?
He sometimes called me
"wife" when we were together,
and I called him "husband."
It was no contract.
If there was a contract,
then your marriage
to the King would be invalid,
you might face shame...
But you would not forfeit your life.
He promised to love me
with all his heart.
I think it was no contract.
Did Dereham have carnal knowledge
of you after you became Queen?
No, my Lord. He never did.
I'll go back to London
and draft
a plea of forgiveness for you
to submit to the King.
Wait!
I have important things to say.
My Lady?
I never consented to
sex with Francis Dereham.
He used importunate
force against me.
In a manner...
violence.
He raped you?
The Queen confessed?
Yes. She told me
that Dereham raped her.
I'm sure she was lying as
and about other things too.
But I do believe that there was
some form of pre-contract
between them, which would
invalidate the marriage.
She claims to be innocent
after the marriage?
Of course.
- And you believed that?
- You don't believe it?
I don't believe
anything Dereham says.
It might not be Dereham.
Why does Your Grace say that?
You have the Queen's confession?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The Queen begs for mercy.
She confesses that she was
so desirous to be taken
into Your Grace's favour, so blinded
by desire for worldly glory,
that she did not consider
how great a fault it was
to conceal her former
faults from Your Majesty.
"Considering that I intended
"ever during my life
"to be faithful
and true to Your Majesty."
- We can proceed with the annulment?
- I think it would be best.
I don't believe that you
didn't have carnal knowledge
of the Queen after her marriage.
Please don't! It is the truth!
Because someone else had
succeeded me in her affections.
Who?
Thomas Culpepper.
Thomas Culpepper?
The King's groom?
Yes, sir.
How well did you know this man,
Thomas Culpepper?
Quite well.
I flirted with him
met him by the back stairs,
and gave him gifts.
He called me his "
sweet little fool."
And did you commit
adultery with him?
No, My Lord. I never did
although...
Lady Rochford
encouraged me to do so.
Lady Rochford encouraged you?
Yes, she did.
And then she spread a vile rumour
that we were lovers,
which we never were.
You don't deny that
you met with the Queen
- in secret on many occasions?
- No, My Lord.
But you deny that you ever
committed adultery with her?
I do.
We never passed beyond words.
If you don't tell me the truth,
Mr. Culpepper,
you will be tortured till you do.
I'm telling you the truth.
Which isn't to say
I didn't want to go further!
I intended and meant to do so
with the Queen, and she with me.
My God.
That evil intent in itself
constitutes high treason.
But it was...
Katherine who led me on!
She wanted it, not me.
And her servant, Lady Rochford,
she provoked it
and acted as a procuress,
like some madam in a brothel!
Why are they blaming me?
It's not my fault.
I had to stand guard when they
met in the Queen's chambers,
or even her stool closet.
I didn't want to.
I didn't like doing it.
Once I even had to stop the King
coming into the Queen's bedchamber,
because Culpepper was already there.
Do you think they had
carnal knowledge at those times?
I cannot think it otherwise,
considering all the things
I heard and saw between them.
Guard!
Do you think I shall die, my Lord?
Do you think I shall die?
Constable! Open up!
Your Majesty asked me
at the beginning
not to desist until I had got
to the bottom of the pot.
Majesty, I fear to say that I
am already scraping the bottom,
and a good companion
of Your Majesty,
a fellow of trust,
seems certain to have
betrayed Your Majesty
committing adultery with the Queen.
Who is he?
Your groom, Thomas Culpepper.
So far, both of them
have denied the charges,
though neither of them denies
the illicit meetings
they had on the backstairs
and in the Queen's stool closet
during Your Majesty's last progress.
Lady Rochford
and other maids of Her Majesty have
come forward
with corroborating evidence
of their frequent intimacies.
This letter was discovered
in Mr. Culpepper's chambers.
It is the Queen's handwriting.
She writes:
"It makes my heart die to think
"I cannot always be
in your company."
"I heard that you were sick
and longed so much to see you."
And it is signed:
"Yours as long as life endures
"Katherine."
What has happened is your fault!
Your fault!
You solicited me to marry her!
How misfortunate I am to have had
so many ill-conditioned wives!
I vow that any pleasure
that wicked bitch got from
her wantonness will
be nothing, nothing
in comparison to the pain
she going to feel
at the hand of my torturer!
Well done, wife.
What shall we call him?
Thomas.
Very well. Thomas he is.
You want to ask Lady Rochford
some more questions?
- Yes.
- There's no point, Sir Thomas.
Lady Rochford has gone mad.
Death to you!
There you are.
Majesty? His Grace,
the Duke of Suffolk.
You've never read the Bible,
have you, Charles?
No, Your Majesty.
I've always allowed others,
with more knowledge than I,
to read it for me.
In that case, you've missed
many great sayings and truths,
Like this one here
in the Book of Solomon:
"The lips of a harlot are
"a dropping honeycomb.
"Her throat is softer than oil.
"Yet in the end,
"she is as bitter as wormwood,
and as sharp
as a double-edged sword."
Why have you come?
King Francis has sent you a letter.
What does it say?
"I am sorry to hear of the displeasure
and trouble which has been
caused "by the lewd and naughty
behavior of the Queen.
"But knowing my brother to be
a prince of prudence and honor,
"I do require him
to throw off the said displeasure
"and wisely, temperately,
like myself,
"not reputing his honour to rest
in the lightness of a woman,
"but to thank God of all,
comforting himself in God's goodness.
"The lightness of women cannot
bend the honour of men."
You tell Francis to go.
Tell His Majesty
that we are grateful
for his solicitations.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- What of Dereham and Culpepper?
- They've been arraigned for treason?
- They were tried together.
At the last moment, Culpepper
changed his plea to guilty,
but both were found so.
They are due to be hanged,
drawn and quartered together at Tyburn.
Tell the judge to commute
Culpepper's sentencing to beheading.
I hate Dereham more,
since he spoiled the Queen for me.
Now, what of Lady Rochford?
She has been found guilty
of misprision and treason
but, since she is insane,
she cannot be executed.
You tell Richard Rich
to pass a bill in Parliament
making it legal to execute
an insane person for treason.
Do you hear?
Yes, Your Majesty.
You were one of those who placed
Katherine Howard in front of me.
Any regrets?
Charles.
Majesty.
You should be ashamed of yourselves!
Traitor!
"Master Culpepper,
"I heartily recommend me unto you,
"praying you to send me
word how that you do.
"I heard that you were sick,
"and never longed so much
for anything as to see you.
"I would you were with
me now that you might see
"what pain I take in writing to you.
"It makes my heart die to think
"I cannot always be
in your company."
I beg you all to pray for me.
"He, Dereham,
"gave me lots of lovers' tokens.
"He knew a little woman in London
with a crooked back,
"who was skilled
in making flowers of silk,
"who made for him a French fennel
to give to me.
"And later, a heart's ease
for a New Year's present,
"and some sarcenet,
which I had made into a quilted cap.
"He called me "wife,"
"and touched the secret
parts of my body.
"I remember I gave him
a collar and sleeves for a shirt.
"And one day,
"he snatched a silver bracelet
from me and kept it,
"saying,'Here, wife, a gift for me.'
"And he kissed me often
and so passionately
"that everyone said he would
never have kissed me enough."
Katherine Howard,
you are indicted for
having led an abominable,
base, carnal, voluptuous,
and vicious life before
marriage like a common harlot-
with several persons.
You led the King by word
and gesture to love you,
concealing your contract
with Francis Dereham
to the peril of the King
and his children begotten by you.
And after marriage,
you showed the same Dereham
notable favour,
while inciting Thomas Culpepper...
to carnal knowledge,
telling him
you loved him above the King.
It is my duty...
to escort you to the Tower.
My Lady.
Sir Edward.
Don't let them.
No.
God!
- My Lady.
- No, no, no, no!
Is she condemned?
Yes, Your Majesty.
What of the others?
Dereham and Culpepper
have been executed
and the bill allowing
a mad person to be executed
for treason has become law.
I want to have a party.
- Here is a list of guests.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Katherine Howard, I have to tell
you that you are going to die.
You'll be taken tomorrow morning,
the 13th of February,
escorted by members
of the Privy Council.
May I ask one favour?
Will you bring the block to me-
so that I might know
how to place myself
and...
make trial of it?
As you wish.
Is there anything else you need?
Do you want a confessor?
No.
I have spoken to God so rarely,
I did not think
He would know who I was.
Ladies.
Something sweet?
What do you think? Your Majesty.
A beautiful Queen.
Madam. - Do you want
to say a few words?
I...
ask forgiveness for my sins,
from His Gracious Majesty,
from God,
and from all of you.
Shall I say more?
No, my Lady.
That is already sufficient.
Thank you.
It's time, my Lady.
I have come here to die.
I die a Queen.
But I would rather die
the wife of Culpepper...
Life is...
very beautiful.

Le roi d'Écosse ne viendra pas.

Organisez les représailles.
Pillez, incendiez, tuez.
Trois réponses à ses attaques.
Ces hommes de vile naissance,
anoblis par le Roi,
ont été la risée
de la noblesse de ce royaume.
Si Dieu rappelle le Roi à lui,
ils en paieront le prix.
L'Empereur et le roi de France
pensent à la guerre.
Dites à votre maître qu'il serait
insensé de vouloir envahir cette île.
Au contraire, l'Angleterre est
son allié naturel contre l'Empereur.
Je ne me retirerai pas d'une bataille
où l'on m'a provoqué.
Jusqu'à présent,
on ne parlait que de guerre.
Je me sens déçu.
J'ai faim de guerre.
Je pensais que les Français
me feraient plaisir.
La lettre dit que la Reine
avait une vie dissolue
avant de vous épouser.
Sa conduite n'était pas un secret.
Faites toute la lumière
sur cette affaire.
Vous resterez dans vos appartements
à la convenance du roi.
Pourquoi dois-je rester ici ?
- Francis Dereham, je vous arrête.
- Pour quelle raison ?
Vous avez eu
des rapports intimes avec la Reine.
Un autre m'avait supplanté
dans son affection.
- Qui ?
- Thomas Culpepper.
Katherine m'y a incité.
Elle le voulait, moi pas.
"Vous vous êtes fait
aimer par le Roi,
"taisant votre contrat avec Dereham.
"Après le mariage,
vous lui avez accordé vos faveurs,

Quelle infortune d'avoir eu
de si mauvaises épouses.

Êtes-vous habillée ?
Pas encore, je lisais.
Venez, j'ai des nouvelles.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- J'ai appris
que le Parlement
nous rétablit toutes deux
dans la succession.
Après Edward et ses descendants,
bien sûr.
Ce doit être un ordre du Roi
en personne.
N'êtes-vous pas heureuse ?
Pensez aux implications.
Oui, Mary. Si vous êtes heureuse,
je le suis aussi.
Cela veut dire que le Roi nous aime.
Vous pourriez un jour être reine.
Et vous,
Reine Elizabeth.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
À cause de ce qui est arrivé
à la Reine Katherine,
j'ai pris une décision.
Laquelle ?
Dieu m'est témoin,
je ne me marierai jamais.
Jamais.
Majesté, Son Excellence
l'ambassadeur impérial.
- Excellence.
- Votre Majesté.
Votre Majesté est trop aimable.
Votre Majesté doit être au courant.
Mon maître, l'empereur,
est de nouveau en guerre
avec le roi François.
L'alliance méprisable
du roi de France avec les Turcs
menace non seulement
les frontières de l'Empire,
mais aussi la stabilité
de l'Europe toute entière.
Pour cette seule raison,
Sa Majesté impériale m'a demandé
de tendre à nouveau la main
à Votre Majesté
pour s'allier
contre ces perfides Français.
Qu'y gagnerais-je ?
Tous vos anciens territoires.
L'Aquitaine toute entière.
Excellence.
Risley !
Excellence.
Son Excellence,
l'ambassadeur de France.
- Monsieur Marillac.
- Votre Majesté.
J'apprends
que votre pays est en guerre.
En effet.
L'empereur a brisé ses promesses
et les engagements du traité,
trahissant mon maître,
le Roi François,
et vous-même.
Monsieur Marillac,
en signant le traité,
votre maître nous a promis
une pension annuelle
qu'il n'a pas versée
depuis deux ans.
Par conséquent, il nous doit
un million de couronnes.
- Majesté, si c'est vrai...
- Doutez-vous de mes paroles ?
Alors...
J'informerai Sa Majesté.
Et cela sera réparé.
L'alliance entre nos pays
maintient l'équilibre des pouvoirs
en Europe depuis plus de dix ans.
Votre Majesté ne peut souhaiter
compromettre cet arrangement
face à l'agression de l'Empereur ?
Écrivez une lettre au roi d'Écosse.
Dites-lui que je l'invite
à signer un traité
nous reconnaissant comme suzerain
de son pays.
Qu'il cesse ses alliances
avec les Français et le Pape
ou il en subira les conséquences.
Préparez-vous à partir en Écosse,
au cas où mon cousin refuse
d'accéder à nos demandes.
Surrey ira avec vous.
Vous jouez très bien, M. Leigh.
C'est toujours le signe
d'une vie gâchée.
Vous savez,
vous et moi
avons en commun
plus que vous ne le pensez.
Quoi ?
Nos familles
viennent de la paroisse
de St Mary à Stockwell.
Nos chapelles ont été bâties
la même année.
Cela ne nous rend pas égaux,
M. Leigh.
Et puis,
comme la vôtre,
ma famille...
est liée par le sang...
à la défunte reine.
N'est-il pas inconvenant
d'évoquer son fantôme à la cour ?
Je trouve inconvenant
que vous, les Howard, ayez refusé
de voir sa conduite méprisable,
qui a terni la réputation de ceux
qui lui sont apparentés !
"Vous les Howard !"
C'est ce que vous avez dit ?
"Les Howard" ?
Gardes !
Je vais vous couper la langue,
Dieu m'est témoin !
Je couperai votre putain de langue !
Lâchez-moi !
Lord Latimer,
Sir Thomas Seymour.
Merci d'être venu.
Je vous prie...
de pardonner mon infirmité.
Je ne suis pas en bonne santé.
Vous serez sans doute
bientôt rétabli.
J'ai bien peur que ma santé
ne soit trop altérée.
Je vous présente mon épouse,
Catherine Parr.
Catherine, Sir Thomas Seymour.
Je vous en prie.
Asseyez-vous, Sir Thomas.
J'ignore si vous connaissez
mon histoire.
Les Latimer
sont originaires du Nord.
Hélas, nous avons été touchés
par la rébellion contre Sa Majesté.
J'ai moi-même
été l'otage de Robert Aske
qui m'a contraint par la force.
Sa Majesté m'a demandé
de renier Aske, ce que j'ai fait,
et je suis venu à Londres
pour me rendre.
Je pense néanmoins que ma famille
est encore soupçonnée de trahison.
Je sais que vous avez
l'attention du roi.
Je voudrais que vous intercédiez
en ma faveur auprès de Sa Majesté,
et témoigniez de ma loyauté...
Là, mon bien-aimé.
Fermez les yeux et reposez-vous.
Soupçonne-t-il quelque chose ?
Non. Je suis sûre
qu'il ne sait rien.
Il lui reste peu de temps à vivre.
Ne dites pas de telles choses.
Je ne pourrai pas attendre
que nous soyons réunis et mariés.
Aussi vrai que Dieu est Dieu,
je désire vous épouser
plus que tout.
Le Comte de Surrey a écrit une lettre
au Conseil de Sa Majesté.
Le Comte est détenu
à la Prison de la Flotte.
La prison ?
Pour quoi ?
Il s'est bagarré
avec un certain John Leigh,
non loin de la cour,
et a été arrêté
par le sergent d'armes.
La cause de cette querelle ?
Je pense qu'on a porté atteinte
à sa fierté.
- Qu'a-t-il écrit ?
- Il exige sa libération immédiate.
- Et ?
- Nous avons averti sa seigneurie
que son manque d'humilité
nuirait à ses perspectives de liberté.
Pourquoi demande-t-il
sa libération ?
Le Comte de Surrey pense
qu'il n'a pas à être traité ainsi.
Il parle également
de son empressement
à servir activement Votre Majesté.
Je pense que c'est le fou le plus fier
d'Angleterre.
Assurez-vous de sa conduite à venir.
Mais libérez-le,
je le veux en Écosse.
ÉCOSSE
<i>Continuez
avec votre fierté écossaise !</i>
Voici trois nobles
capturés pendant la bataille.
Lord Cassilis, Lord Glencairn,
et Lord Maxwell.
My Lords,
vous serez traités
avec l'honneur et le respect
dûs à vos rang et positon.
Au nom de Sa Majesté,
le Roi Henry VIII,
je vous invite à rentrer à Londres
avec nous.
Vous y serez installés
confortablement.
Je dois cependant
vous demander vos épées.
D'accord.
<i>Venez avec ces chevaux
et apportez une corde !</i>
My Lords, nous avons remporté
une grande victoire à Solway Moss.
Grâce à Messires Hertford et Surrey,
certains nobles écossais,
ont été capturés et enfermés ici.
Mais ce n'est pas tout, Messires.
Déstabilisé par sa sévère défaite,
le Roi d'Écosse a gardé le lit
et est décédé il y a deux jours.
Ce jour-là, sa femme a mis au monde
leur seul enfant.
Ce n'était pas
l'héritier mâle espéré,
mais une fille.
Votre Majesté,
je pense que nous devrions y voir
une intervention divine,
la couronne écossaise revient
à une très jeune femme...
- Grâce soit rendue à Dieu.
- Grâce soit rendue à Dieu, en effet.
Ce sera un Noël très heureux.
En l'absence d'une Reine,
Lady Mary présidera les festivités.
Mon fils fera
sa premières apparition publique.
- My Lords.
- Votre Majesté.
Vous auriez dit que j'ai été clément
avec le Comte de Surrey.
Et qu'il méritait
une autre punition.
- Votre Majesté, je pensais...
- Pourquoi pensez-vous ?
Si j'étais vous,
je ne penserais pas,
si cela conduit
à une mauvaise conclusion.
Sortez, Tom.
- Vous êtes belle.
- My Lord.
Je vous souhaite un joyeux Noël.
Et Lord Latimer ?
Guère mieux.
Il n'avait pas la force
de venir à la cour.
Je suis triste pour vous deux.
Je prie pour vous.
Je vous en remercie.
Je lui transmettrai vos vœux
et joyeux Noël.
Joyeux Noël.
<i>Son Excellence,
l'ambassadeur de France.</i>
Enchanté !
<i>Le Prince Edward et Lady Elizabeth.</i>
Ne soyez pas si impatient.
<i>Le Comte et Lady Hertford.</i>
Prince Edward.
My Lords,
laissez-moi vous présenter Sa Grâce,
- Prince Edward.
- My Lords.
Votre Grâce.
Soyez les bienvenus à la cour
de Sa Majesté pour Noël.
Votre Grâce est très aimable
de nous parler en personne.
Je me suis entraîné.
Très bien. Venez.
<i>Lady Scofield et Lady Davit.</i>
Le Roi a une proposition
à vous soumettre.
Un traité de paix devrait être conclu
entre nos pays
et des fiançailles officielles
entre le Prince Edward
et la nouvelle née Mary,
Princesse d'Écosse.
Le Roi est conscient
des difficultés possibles.
C'est pourquoi,
si vous soutenez la cause,
vous serez récompensés
par une pension
et vous serez libres
de retourner en Écosse.
Vos familles doivent vous manquer
à cette époque de l'année.
Je sais comment je me sentirais
si j'étais séparé de ma chère épouse.
Votre Grâce.
Bienvenue à la cour.
- La Duchesse n'est pas avec vous ?
- Non.
Elle est...
La Duchesse fait comme il lui plaît.
Nous menons des vies séparées.
J'en suis désolée.
Je prierai
pour votre réconciliation.
Comment va le Roi ?
Il a été triste,
comme vous pouvez le deviner.
Il doit désespérer
de trouver le bonheur dans la vie.
Mais son humeur a changé
au cours des dernières semaines.
Je ne peux expliquer pourquoi.
Le triomphe en Écosse peut-être ?
- Votre Grâce.
- <i>Sa Majesté le Roi !</i>
- Joyeux Noël.
- Joyeux Noël, Votre Majesté !
- Votre Majesté.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
Lady Latimer
est venue prier Votre Majesté
de lever le soupçon de trahison
contre son époux, Lord Latimer.
Où est-elle ?
Qu'y gagnez-vous, Tom ?
Rien, Votre Majesté.
Je suis juste un ami de la famille.
Je crois Lord Latimer
loyal à Votre Majesté.
Vous pensez à autre chose
et vous avez un autre but.
Non, non. Ne niez pas.
Je ne peux vous blâmer.
C'est encore une très belle femme,
et bientôt une très riche veuve.
Amenez-la-moi.
Mes excuses, j'étais éloigné de la cour.
Le Roi ne m'a pas prévenu.
Ambassadeur, excusez-moi.
Vous avez été longtemps absent,
Votre Grâce.
Je m'occupais de mes propriétés,
Votre Majesté.
J'aurais pensé
que vous auriez pris soin de moi.
Vous me croyez encore fâché
contre vous.
Soyez prudent, Votre Grâce.
Vous ne devriez pas
négliger votre souverain si longtemps.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Je veux que vous fassiez
quelque chose pour moi.
- Votre Grâce !
- Je dois parler à votre maître.
Hélas, Votre Grâce, mon maître
est alité à cause de sa goutte.
Non, faites entrer Sa Grâce,
je vous en prie.
Que Votre Grâce me pardonne.
Bien sûr.
Je vous ai apporté quelque chose.
Puis-je demander ce que c'est ?
Les grandes lignes
pour un traité secret entre nos maîtres.
Les saisies de navires marchands anglais
dans les ports français,
et l'amitié du Roi de France
avec les Turcs,
ont été la goutte d'eau.
Le Roi Henry
promet de soutenir l'Empereur
quand il sera fait appel à lui.
Il promet d'envahir la France,
avec les armées de l'Empereur.
Votre Grâce
n'aurait pu plus me réjouir
si elle pouvait guérir la goutte !
Je vais m'assurer que cela parvienne
au plus vite à l'empereur
vous pouvez être certain
qu'il l'aura avec le plus grand plaisir.
Votre Majesté.
Lady Latimer est là.
Je voulais vous assurer
qu'aucun soupçon de trahison
ne pèse sur votre mari,
et encore moins
sur vous ou votre famille.
Merci, Votre Majesté.
Je connais la cause
du désarroi de Lord Latimer
depuis la révolte.
Je sais aussi que vous
et vos enfants adoptifs
avez été maltraités
par le traître Robert Aske.
Vous avez dû avoir très peur.
À l'époque, Sir,
je m'inquiétais plus pour mon mari,
pour sa santé et son équilibre.
J'ai appris
que Lord Latimer est malade.
Il est en effet très malade,
Majesté,
et n'a plus longtemps à vivre.
Vous n'avez pas d'enfants de lui ?
Non, Votre Majesté.
Ni de votre premier mari ?
Non.
À 17 ans,
j'ai épousé Edward Borough,
le fils de Lord Borough.
Mais il est mort
trois ans plus tard.
On m'a dit qu'il était fou.
Est-ce vrai ?
Ce n'était pas un mariage heureux,
Majesté.
Croyez-vous que cela existe ?
Oui !
En mon cœur et en mon âme,
je le crois.
Veuillez m'excuser.
Non, non.
Je dois vous féliciter,
Lady Latimer,
pour votre...
éternel optimisme.
Votre Grâce.
Sa Majesté a envoyé ces documents
pour vous.
Merci, M. Risley.
M. Risley,
vous savez que je suis sûr
que le Roi a conclu
un pacte secret avec l'empereur,
le grand défenseur du catholicisme !
Je ne vois donc aucune raison
de ne pas chasser les Luthériens
et Évangélistes du royaume.
Croyez-vous
qu'il y en ait beaucoup ?
Bien sûr !
Ils se reproduisent comme des rats.
Ils propagent
leur vile hérésie partout !
Certains d'entre eux sont encore
très proches du Roi.
Et...
il faudrait les chasser ?
Exactement.
Et les mettre
sur le bûcher de Smithfield.
Êtes-vous d'accord, M. Risley ?
Des colis, mon cœur ?
De qui ?
De la part du Roi.
Le Roi ?
Des colis venant du Roi ?
Ne vas-tu pas les ouvrir ?
- Si.
- Alors, ouvre-les.
Qu'est-ce ?
Des tissu plissés... et des manches.
Pour des robes.
Fais-moi voir.
- Sont-elles à la mode ?
- Oui.
Pourquoi le Roi
t'envoie-t-il des cadeaux ?
Je l'ignore. Je crois
que je devrais les rendre.
Tu ne peux pas
refuser des cadeaux du Roi.
Tu dois les accepter.
Je ne sais pas
pourquoi il les a envoyés.
Si, tu le sais, ma chérie.
Tu le sais.
Je me sens déjà comme mort.
J'invite Sa Majesté,
le Roi Henry VIII,
à jurer devant Dieu
et ces témoins ici présents
d'honorer ce nouveau traité
entre Sa Majesté
et le Roi Charles V,
Empereur romain germanique.
Ce traité d'assistance mutuelle
comporte en son sein une obligation
de faire la guerre à la France
dans un délai de deux ans,
Sa Majesté s'engageant
à envoyer 40 000 combattants
à cet effet.
Majesté,
jurez-vous d'honorer
tous les termes de ce traité ?
Je le jure devant Dieu.
- Signerez-vous le traité ?
- Oui.
Enfin.
Vos hommes iront en France.
Alors, Excellence,
est-il vrai qu'un traité a été signé
entre le Roi et l'Empereur ?
Je ne comprends pas.
Comment le désir de régner
sur la chrétienté
a-t-il pu faire oublier à un prince
aussi rancunier, l'insulte
reçue du Roi d'Angleterre
à travers sa tante ?
Ces insultes sont bien anciennes,
Monsieur Marillac.
Vous ne niez donc pas
que vous projetez
de régner sur la chrétienté ?
Je le nie.
Ce sont plutôt
les ambitions des Turcs,
avec qui votre maître est allié !
- Excellence !
- Votre Grâce.
Je vous avertis officiellement
d'une intention de guerre.
Lady Latimer est ici, Sir Thomas.
Laisse-moi te regarder !
Tu es très belle.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Cette robe est un cadeau.
Un cadeau ?
- De la part de qui ?
- Du Roi.
Depuis quand le Roi
t'envoie-t-il des cadeaux ?
C'est récent.
Ce n'est pas ma faute !
Non, bien sûr.
Pas toi.
Tu me crois, non ?
Dis que tu me crois.
Je t'aime, Thomas.
Je n'ai pas voulu
ces avances du Roi,
je ne les apprécie pas.
Ne veux-tu pas...
- être Reine d'Angleterre ?
- Non !
Grand Dieu ! Tu sais
ce qui arrive à ses Reines !
On sait tous ce qui leur arrive.
J'ai peur.
Non.
C'est juste un homme seul
qui s'est entiché de toi.
Je l'espère.
Votre Majesté,
la Reine régente d'Écosse
a autorisé le début des négociations
pour le contrat de mariage
entre sa fille Mary,
future Reine d'Écosse,
et votre fils, le Prince Edward.
Après les négociations,
un traité sera signé,
unissant par le mariage
les trônes anglais et écossais,
comme le désire Votre Majesté.
Il semble que les seigneurs écossais
aient obéi à nos ordres.
Majesté, avec une Reine infante,
une noblesse querelleuse
et un manque de soutien français,
- quel choix ont les Écossais ?
- Je suis d'accord.
Je vous demande de faire vite
et de saisir cette chance.
Je me méfie des Écossais.
Votre Grâce, avez-vous un problème ?
Majesté,
j'ai le regret de vous informer
que nous avons découvert
un repaire d'hérétiques
au cœur même de votre maisonnée.
De qui parlez-vous ?
Des musiciens de la Chapelle Royale.
Tous ?
Le chef du chœur, John Marbeck,
est accusé d'être
secrètement calviniste.
Il y a aussi l'organiste,
Robert Testwood et Edmund Harman,
un chanteur.
Avons-nous la permission
d'arrêter et d'interroger
ces hommes ?
Je vous y autorise.
Je ne tolérerai aucun Évangéliste
dans la maison royale.
Et à ceux
qui voudraient mettre à mal
ma Réforme, je dis :
l'Église d'Angleterre
ne sera pas transformée
de mon vivant.
John Marbeck. Robert Testwood !
Edmund Harman ! Vous êtes en état
d'arrestation.
Attrapez-le !
Vous n'auriez pas dû venir,
M. Testwood.
Messire, où pourrais-je aller ?
Aidez-moi,
par pitié
Je ne puis rien faire
sans me condamner
et ça, je ne le ferai pas.
Vous serez interrogé par Gardiner.
Si vous dites
ce qu'il veut entendre,
- n'ayez crainte.
- Je crains, My Lady,
que Sa Grâce ne recoure
à d'autres moyens de persuasion.
C'est le procédé actuel.
Soyez résolu dans votre foi,
M. Testwood.
Nous savons tous qu'un jour,
nous suivrons
la voie du Christ.
Si nous avons peur,
si nous nous détournons,
nous ne pouvons nous considérer
comme de vrais chrétiens.
Si vous mentionnez
le nom de mon époux,
je vous assure que les choses
iront très mal pour votre famille.
Votre tendre épouse
et vos deux adorables enfants.
On m'a dit que vous avez été malade,
Lady Mary.
Rien de sérieux, j'espère.
Je vous remercie.
Les médecins m'ont saignée
une ou deux fois et je me sens mieux.
Dieu merci.
- Oui, Dieu merci.
- My Lady.
Donnez-moi des nouvelles de la cour.
Le roi pense-t-il se remarier ?
Une nouvelle loi a été édictée.
Elle oblige les dames
que le roi pourrait épouser,
sous peine de mort,
à dévoiler toute conduite libertine
qui pourrait leur être reprochée.
Honnêtement,
cela réduit les opportunités.
Les dames de la cour...
comment dire,
ne sont pas connues pour leur vertu.
Je pense cependant
que le roi voudra se remarier.
Il a un fils, c'est vrai,
mais serait rassuré
d'en avoir un second,
- si le premier venait à mourir.
- C'est vrai.
Mais quelle femme
voudrait épouser un roi
qui répudie ses femmes
ou les tue ?
Monsieur Testwood.
Nous avons découvert chez vous
les preuves qui vous condamnent
comme calviniste.
Néanmoins,
je vous sauverais volontiers.
Mais il faut d'abord m'aider.
Pensez-y.
Ce que vous endurez n'est rien
comparé aux souffrances du bûcher.
Et tout cela parce que...
à tort, par méprise
et avec perfidie,
vous protégez vos supérieurs.
Si seulement
vous me donniez leurs noms.
Avancez !
Ce majordome du roi,
Sir Philip Holby,
fait-il partie de votre cercle ?
Non.
Dr Simon Heynes, le doyen d'Exeter ?
Vous avez chanté pour lui, je crois.
Est-il lui aussi un hérétique ?
Et qu'en est-il
du Comte d'Hertford ?
Donnez-moi le comte d'Hertford,
et je vous rends votre vie.
Excellente idée, Votre Majesté.
C'est mon histoire préférée.
- L'aimez-vous ?
- Bien sûr.
Comment va votre époux,
Lady Latimer ?
Il reste alité, Votre Majesté.
Il a rédigé son testament.
J'en suis navré.
Je dois remercier Votre Majesté
pour cette belle robe
et vos cadeaux généreux,
que je ne mérite en aucune façon.
Vous semblez triste, My Lady.
Votre vie a dû être difficile
dernièrement.
Je voulais vous redonner
un peu de gaité.
Je voulais un sourire.
Là.
La guerre est imminente.
Votre avis, Lord Suffolk ?
- Le plus tôt sera le mieux.
- C'est vrai.
Cette guerre sera l'occasion
de surpasser Henry V
à Azincourt.
- Et vous, Lord Surrey ?
- Majesté, je suis de ceux
qui aspirent
aux honneurs de la guerre.
La France
est le champ de bataille idéal.
Vrai.
Jouez-vous aux cartes,
Lady Latimer ?
Oui, Votre Majesté. J'y joue.
Bien.
Le roi semble apprécier
Lady Latimer.
C'est vrai.
Nous savons que s'il se prend
d'affection pour quelqu'un,
il va en général jusqu'au bout.
Peut-être
est-ce la raison de sa joie.
Messire,
qu'est-il arrivé
aux musiciens arrêtés ?
Gardiner les a vus.
Leurs réponses
ne lui plaisaient pas.
Ils ont été transférés à la Tour.
Puis-je demander
la raison de cette curiosité ?
Oui. Vous le pouvez.
Excusez-moi.
Vous gagnez, madame.
Votre gain.
- Non, Majesté.
- S'il vous plaît.
Majesté, je ne peux pas.
Regardez-le.
Votre Majesté,
bien que je sois touchée
et flattée,
je ne peux l'accepter.
Par pitié,
acceptez-la.
Merci.
Je vous en prie.
Du nouveau pour vous.
- Majesté ?
- Je vous envoie à Bruxelles,
comme ambassadeur
auprès du Régent des Pays-Bas.
Êtes vous content, Sir Thomas ?
Je...
je suis très reconnaissant, Majesté.
Bien.
Envisagez-vous un nouveau mariage ?
Peut-être.
- Et une guerre avec la France ?
- C'est sûr.
- Voulez-vous vraiment vous battre ?
- Oui.
Pas vous ?
Je croyais que oui.
- Et prendre une autre épouse ?
- Oui.
N'en suis-je plus capable ?
D'avoir une épouse ?
D'avoir d'autres enfants ?
D'être moi-même ?
<i>Requiem aeternum dona es Domine,</i>
<i>et Lux perpetua luceat eis.</i>
John, j'ai quelque chose
à vous dire.
Allez au diable.
<i>In nomine Patris et Filii et
Spiritus Sancti. Amen.</i>
Catherine Parr,
à la demande du Roi,
nous venons vous offrir,
lorsque le deuil de votre époux
sera terminé,
la main de Sa Majesté en mariage.
Sa Majesté vous estime plus
que toute autre femme de son royaume
et espère
que vous accepterez son offre,
ce qui ferait de lui l'homme
le plus heureux d'Angleterre,
et de vous
la plus heureuse des femmes.
<i>Previously, on The Tudors.</i>
The king of Scotland is not coming.
But worse,
His army has ridden over the border
and is harrying our people
and killing all those
who oppose them.
Sir Thomas, you'll order our troops
to retaliate with burnings and killings.
3 hurts to every one of ours.
Those men that are made
by the king of vile birth
have been the distraction
of all the nobility of this realm.
And if God calls away the King,
they will suffer for it.
The Emperor and the King of France
are on the brink of war.
You will convey to your master it'd be
foolish to contemplate an invasion.
On the contrary, he regards England
as his natural ally against the Emperor.
I mean to show these French that I won't
shy away from battle if I am provoked.
Until recently, nothing but war
had been talked of.
Something inside me is disappointed.
It hungers for a war.
I actually thought the French
might oblige me this time?
The letter accuses Queen Katherine
of dissolute living
before she was married
and that her way of life isn't a secret.
Do not desist until you've reached
the bottom of the pot.
You are confined to your apartments
for as long as it please the King.
Why? Why must I stay here?
- Francis Dereham, you are under arrest.
- Under arrest? For what?
I don't believe that you didn't have
carnal knowledge of the Queen.
Someone else has succeeded me
in her affections!
- Who?
- Thomas Culpepper.
But it was Katherine who led me on.
She wanted it, not me.
"Katherine Howard, you led the King
by word and gesture to love you,
"concealing your contract
with Francis Dereham,
"and after marriage, you showed
the same Dereham notable favour
"while inciting Thomas Culpepper
to carnal knowledge,
"telling him you love him
above the King."
What has happened is your fault.
You solicited me to marry her.
How misfortunate I am
to have so many ill-conditioned wives.
No! Henry!

Tr.: YYets.
Are you dressed?
Not quite, I was reading.
Come and sit. I have some news.
- What is it?
- I just heard!
By Act of Parliament,
you and I are both
restored to the succession.
After Edward and his heirs,
of course.
The King himself
must have commanded this.
Are you not pleased, Elizabeth?
Think what this means.
Yes, Mary. If you are pleased
then so am I.
It means that the King
loves both of us.
And that you may be Queen some day.
And you,
Queen Elizabeth.
What's wrong?
Because of what happened
to Queen Katherine,
I have made my mind up.
In what?
As God is my witness,
I shall never marry!
Never!
Your Majesty, His Excellency
the Imperial Ambassador.
- Excellency.
- Your Majesty.
Your Majesty is most gracious.
I am sure Your Majesty is aware.
My master, the Emperor
is once more at war
with King Francis.
The French King's despicable
alliance with the Turk
threatens not only the borders
of the Emperor's domains,
but also the security
of the whole of Europe.
For that reason alone,
his Imperial Majesty has asked me
to offer the hand of friendship
to Your Majesty once more,
in joint alliance
against the perfidious French.
What would I gain?
All your lost territories.
The whole of Aquitaine.
Excellency.
Risley!
Excellency.
His Excellency,
the French Ambassador.
- Monsieur Marillac.
- Your Majesty.
I hear your country is at war,
with the Emperor.
Indeed.
The Emperor has broken all his promises
and treaty obligations,
both to my master King Francis,
and to you.
Monsieur Marillac,
when you signed a treaty,
your master agreed to pay
an annual pension to this country,
which he has defaulted on
for the past two years.
As a consequence, he now owes
arrears of a million crowns.
- Majesty, if that is true...
- You doubt my word, Monsieur Marillac?
Then...
His Majesty will be informed.
And redress will surely follow.
The alliance between our countries
has kept the balance of power
in Europe for over ten years.
Surely Your Majesty would not care
to compromise that arrangement now,
in the face of Imperial aggression?
I want you to write a letter
to the King of the Scots.
Tell him that we invite him
to sign a treaty
acknowledging our suzerainty
over his country.
Also to tell him to stop
his French and Papal alliances,
or suffer the consequences for it.
I want you to prepare
to go to Scotland
in case my cousin refuses
to concede to our demands.
And take Surrey with you.
You play very well, Mr. Leigh.
Always the sign of a wasted life.
You know,
you and I have
more in common
than you might imagine, my Lord.
What?
Our families
both come from St. Mary's parish
in Stockwell
and our chapels were
founded in the same year.
That hardly makes us equal,
Mr. Leigh.
There is another thing.
Like you,
my family... was related
to the late Queen.
Do not you think it unseemly
to raise her ghost at court?
I think it unseemly
that you Howards turned a blind eye
to her despicable wantonness,
which tarnished the reputations
of all of us associated with her!
"You Howards!"
Is that what you just said?
"You Howards"?!
Guards!
I'll cut your tongue out,
so help me God!
I'll cut your fucking tongue out!
Get off me!
Lord Latimer,
Sir Thomas Seymour.
How good of you to come.
Please...
Please forgive my infirmities.
As you can see, I am not a well man.
I trust your Lordship
will soon recover.
I am afraid my health
is too far broken to be mended.
Allow me to present my wife,
Catherine Parr.
Catherine, Sir Thomas Seymour.
Please. Sit down, Sir Thomas.
I do not know if you are aware
of my personal history?
The Latimers are
an old northern family.
And, unfortunately, we were caught up in
the late Rebellion against His Majesty.
I myself,
was taken hostage by Robert Aske
and sore constrained by him.
His Majesty demanded that
I reject Aske which I did,
and came to London to submit to him.
Still I think the shadow of treason
hangs over me and my family.
I know you have the ear of the King.
I would like you to make submission
on my behalf to His Majesty,
of my utter loyalty...
There, my darling.
Close your eyes and rest now.
Do you think he suspects anything?
No, nothing. I'm sure of it.
He cannot be long for this world.
Hush! Don't say such things.
I only meant that I cannot wait until
we can be together, and married.
As truly as God is God,
I desire to marry you
above all others.
The Earl of Surrey has written
a letter to Your Majesty's Council.
The Earl is presently
detained at the Fleet Prison.
Prison? What for?
It seems he was in an affray
with one John Leigh
within the verge of the court
and was arrested by
the Sergeant-at-Arms.
The cause of the quarrel?
I believe it touched upon...
his Lordship's pride.
- What does he write?
- He demands his immediate release.
- Have you replied?
- We informed his Lordship
that his lack of humility would only
impair his prospects of liberty.
And why does he say
he should be released?
He infers that the Earl of Surrey
has no business being
so treated in the first place.
He also speaks
of his readiness to serve
Your Majesty on active duty.
I think he is the most foolish
proud man in all of England.
Set a high surety on his future
behaviour, but release him.
I want him in Scotland.
<i>Go on with your Scottish pride!</i>
My Lord Surrey, here are three
of their nobles captured in battle.
Lord Cassilis, Lord Glencairn,
and Lord Maxwell.
My Lords,
you will be treated
with the honor and respect
due to your rank and station.
In the name of His Majesty,
King Henry VIII,
I invite you to return
with us to London,
where you will be most
comfortably housed.
However, I must ask you
to surrender your swords.
Aye.
<i>Come with those horses
and bring the rope!</i>
My Lords, a great victory
was had by us at Solway Moss.
Thanks to my Lord Hertford
and to my Lord Surrey,
several Scottish nobles were captured
and are held here at our pleasure.
But that, my lords,
is not the end to our good news.
Distracted by his grievous defeat,
the King of the Scots took to his bed,
and died just two days ago.
And on that day, his wife
gave birth to their only child.
And it was not the son and heir
that they had hoped for,
but a girl.
Your Majesty,
I think we should see it
as an act of divine intervention,
this passing of the Scottish crown
to a very young female...
Thanks be to God.
Thanks be to God, indeed.
It shall be a very happy Christmas.
In the absence of a Queen, I've asked
Mary to preside over the festivities.
Also, my son will be performing
his first public duties.
- My Lords.
- Your Majesty.
I was told you considered my treatment
of the Earl of Surrey far too lenient.
You said he deserved
a greater punishment.
- I simply thought...
- What business do you have to think?
If I were you I would not think,
if thinking makes me come
to the wrong conclusion.
Get out, Tom.
- You look beautiful.
- My Lord.
May I wish you
a very happy Christmas.
- Lady Mary.
- Catherine.
How is Lord Latimer?
No better.
He did not feel strong enough
to come to court.
I am so sad for him and for you.
I pray for both of you.
I thank you for that.
I will give him your good wishes,
and Happy Christmas.
Happy Christmas.
<i>His Excellency,
the French Ambassador.</i>
Excellence.
Enchanté!
<i>Prince Edward and Lady Elizabeth.</i>
Edward.
Don't be so impatient.
<i>The Earl and Lady Hertford.</i>
Prince Edward.
My Lords, may I present His Grace,
- Prince Edward.
- My Lords.
Your Grace.
You are most welcome to His Majesty's
court at this Christmas time.
Your Grace is very kind
to speak to us in person.
I have been practicing.
Well done. Now come.
<i>Lady Scofield and Lady Davit.</i>
My Lords,
the King has a proposal
to put to you.
There should be a peace
treaty between our countries
and a formal betrothal
between Prince Edward
and the newly born
Princess Mary of Scots.
The King is not unaware
of possible difficulties.
Which is why,
if you support the cause,
you will be rewarded
with a handsome pension
and will be released at once
to return to Scotland.
I am sure your families are missing
you greatly at this time of year.
I know how I should feel, if I were
separated from my own dear wife.
Your Grace.
Welcome back to court.
- Is the Duchess not with you?
- No.
She's...
the Duchess does as she pleases.
We live mostly separate lives.
I'm very sorry.
I will pray for your reconciliation.
How is the King?
He has been melancholy
as you might have supposed.
I think he despairs of finding
any happiness in this life.
But in the last few weeks
his mood has altogether changed.
Why, I cannot explain.
Triumph in Scotland, perhaps?
- Your Grace.
- <i>His Majesty the King!</i>
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas Your Majesty!
Bravo!
- Your Majesty.
- What is it?
The Lady Latimer is come
to petition Your Majesty
to lift the suspicion of treason
from her husband, Lord Latimer.
Where is she?
What does any of this
have to do with you, Tom?
Nothing, Your Majesty.
Except that I'm a friend
of the family.
I believe in Lord Latimer's
complete loyalty to Your Majesty.
I think your mind works another way
and to another purpose.
No, no. Don't deny it!
Nor can I blame you.
She is still a very handsome woman,
and soon to be a very rich widow.
Bring her to me.
- Your Majesty.
- Tom.
- Lady Mary.
- My Lord.
My apologies, I have recently been away
from court. I am not privy to the King.
Ambassador, excuse me.
You've been a long time
absent from court, Your Grace!
Only to tend to my estates,
Your Majesty.
I rather thought you'd been
careful of me.
You imagine
I'm still angry with you.
You can be too careful, Your Grace.
It's very remiss of you
to neglect your sovereign for so long.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Anyway, I want you
to do something for me.
- Your Grace!
- I need to speak to your master.
Alas, Your Grace, my master is in bed
with gout and in the greatest agony.
No, no. Show His Grace in,
by all means.
Your Grace must forgive me.
Of course.
I have brought something for you.
May I ask its import?
It contains the outlines
for a secret treaty between our masters.
The recent seizures of English
merchant ships in the French ports,
and the French King's
new amity with the Turks
are the final straw.
King Henry promises
to support the Emperor
whenever he is called upon to do so.
He also pledges to invade France in
conjunction with the Emperor's armies.
Your Grace
could not have made me happier
if you had brought me
a cure for gout!
I will make sure this is delivered
to the Emperor immediately
you can be sure that he will receive it
with the very greatest pleasure.
Your Majesty,
Lady Latimer is here.
I wanted to assure you
there is no suspicion
of treason against your husband,
still less against
you and your family.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I know very well the cause
of the distress to Lord Latimer
during the late rebellion.
I also know that you
and your stepchildren
were very roughly handled
by the traitor Robert Aske.
You must have been very frightened,
My Lady.
Well, at the time, Sir,
I was more frightened
for my husband,
for his safety and his sanity.
I hear that Lord Latimer is unwell.
He is very ill indeed, Your Majesty
and not likely to live long.
You have no children by him?
No, Your Majesty.
Nor by your first husband?
No.
I was married at seventeen
to Edward Borough,
the son of Lord Borough.
But he died three years later.
I was told he was insane.
Is it true?
It was not a happy marriage,
Your Majesty.
Do you think such a thing exists?
Yes!
I believe so
with all my heart and soul.
Ah... please forgive me.
No, no.
You are to be congratulated,
Lady Latimer,
for your...
eternal optimism.
Your Grace,
His Majesty has sent
these papers for your attention.
Thank you, Mr. Risley.
Mr. Risley,
you know I'm sure
that the King has made a
secret treaty with the Emperor,
the great champion of Catholicism!
Well, as a result, I see no reason
why we should not start
hunting down all the Lutherans
and Evangelicals
in His Majesty's Kingdom.
Do you think there are many such?
I know it!
They breed like rats.
They spread the vile disease
of their heresy everywhere!
Some of them, even now,
are very close to the King.
And...
we should flush them out?
Exactly.
And set them
on the pyres at Smithfield.
Don't you agree, Mr. Risley?
Parcels, sweetheart?
Who from?
From the King.
The King?
Parcels from the King?
Are you not going to open them?
- Yes.
- Open them then.
What are they?
Pleats... and sleeves.
For dresses.
Let me look.
- Are they fashionable?
- Yes.
Why should the King
send you presents?
I don't know. I think
that I should return them.
You cannot return
presents to the King.
You must acknowledge them.
I don't know why he has sent them.
Yes you do, my love.
Yes you do.
I feel as though I am dead already.
I call upon His Gracious Majesty,
King Henry VIII,
to pledge before God
and these witnesses
to honor this new Treaty
between His Majesty
and King Charles V,
the Holy Roman Emperor.
This treaty of mutual assurance
contains within it an obligation
to undertake a war against France
within two years of this date,
to which His Majesty
agrees to send 40,000 men-at-arms
for that purpose.
Your Majesty,
do you pledge to honor
all the terms of this new treaty?
I do, so help me God.
- Will you sign the Treaty?
- I will.
Finally.
Your men shall see France.
So Excellency,
is it true that a treaty
has been signed
between His Majesty and the Emperor?
I don't understand.
What, but the design
of subjugating Christendom,
could make a revengeful prince
like the Emperor forget the insult
done to him by the King of England,
in the person of his aunt?
Those insults are long forgotten,
Monsieur Marillac.
You don't deny then,
that your master plan is
to subjugate
the whole of Christendom?
I do deny it.
I believe those ambitions
are held by the Turks,
with whom your own master
is in alliance!
- Excellency!
- Your Grace.
May I present you with a formal
intimation of war against your country.
Lady Latimer is here, Sir Thomas.
My God, look at you!
You look so very beautiful.
What is it?
This dress was a gift.
A gift?
- From whom?
- From the King.
When did the King start
sending you presents?
Recently.
I gave him no cause!
No. Of course not.
How could you?
You do believe me, don't you?
Please say that you believe me.
Thomas, I love you.
I never sought these advances
from the King,
do not welcome them.
You would not...
- like to be Queen of England?
- No!
For heaven's sake! You know
what happens to his Queens!
Everyone knows what happens.
I'm afraid.
Well, don't be.
He's just a lonely man
that has set his cap at you.
I hope so.
Your Majesty should know
that the Regent Queen of Scotland
has given permission
for negotiations to begin
regarding a marriage contract
between her daughter Mary,
soon to be Queen of Scots,
and your son, Prince Edward.
After the negotiations are complete,
a treaty will be signed,
uniting through marriage
the English and Scottish thrones
as Your Majesty so desires.
It seems our Noble Scottish lords
did as we bid them.
Majesty, with an infant Queen,
a quarrelsome nobility,
and a lack of French support,
- what choice do the Scots have?
- I agree.
I ask you to expedite negotiations
and not let this opportunity pass.
I don't always trust the Scots.
Your Grace, you tabled an item?
Your Majesty,
I regret to have to inform you
that we have discovered
a nest of heretics
at the very heart
of Your Majesty's household.
Of whom do you speak?
The musicians of the Royal Chapel.
All of them?
The Master of Choristers,
John Marbeck,
stands accused of being
a secret Calvinist.
Also, the Organist,
Robert Testwood and Edmund Harman,
a singing man.
Do we have permission
to arrest and examine these men?
Your Grace, I give you license.
I will have no Evangelicals
or traitors in this household.
And for those who wish
to alter or push my Reformation
to the extremes, I say this:
there will be no alteration
to the Church of England
as long as I live!
John Marbeck. Robert Testwood!
Edmund Harman! You are all
under arrest.
Seize him!
You should not have come here,
Mr. Testwood.
My Lord, where else could I go?
Please help me.
I beg of you.
There is nothing I can do,
without condemning myself,
and that I will not do.
You are only to be examined
by Gardiner.
If you answer him as he desires,
- then what have you to fear?
- I fear, my Lady,
that His Grace will then resort
to other means of persuasion,
since that is the way now.
Then you must be strong in
your faith, Mr. Testwood.
We all know the day may come
when we have to walk
in the path of Christ.
But if we are afraid,
if we turn away,
then we have no right to call
ourselves true Christians.
If you so much as mention
my husband's name,
I assure you that things will
go very badly with your family.
Your sweet wife
and those two lovely children.
People tell me that you
have been unwell, Lady Mary.
I trust not too unwell.
I thank you.
The surgeons have bled me
once or twice, I think to be better.
God willing.
- Yes, God willing.
- My Lady.
Tell me what is happening in court.
Is the King thinking
of marrying again?
There is a new law enacted.
It requires that any lady
the King may marry must,
on pain of death,
disclose any charge
of sexual misconduct
that might be brought against her.
Frankly, my Lady,
this rather narrows the field.
The ladies at court are...
how to say
not exactly known for their virtue.
I still think the King
will want to remarry.
It is true he has a son,
but he will need another son
to feel secure,
- in case the first should die.
- You are right.
And yet, what woman on earth
would want to marry a King
who either puts his wives away
or kills them?
Master Testwood.
Enough heretical material
was discovered
in your house to have you condemned
as a secret Calvinist.
However, I would fain save you,
but you must help me first.
Just think.
The pain you suffer now
will be as nothing
compared to the pains of the fire.
And all because you...
falsely, mistakenly, treacherously
shelter those above you.
If you will just confess to me
their names.
There is an usher of the King's,
Sir Philip Holby.
Is he one of your heretic circle?
No.
Dr. Simon Heynes,
the Dean of Exeter?
You sang for him once, I think?
Is he another
of your secret heretics?
And what of the Earl of Hertford?
You give me the Earl of Hertford,
and I will give you back your life.
An excellent plan, Your Majesty.
Of all the hook stories,
this is my favorite.
- Do you agree?
- Indeed.
How is your husband, Lady Latimer?
I'm afraid he has taken to his bed,
Your Majesty,
and lately made his will.
I am very sorry to hear that.
I must thank Your Majesty
for this beautiful dress,
and your other generous gifts,
of which
I have done nothing to deserve.
You looked very sad, my Lady.
I am sure your recent life has
been difficult for you.
I wanted to give you something
to give you good cheer.
I wanted to see you smile.
There.
We will soon be at war with France.
How is it, My Lord Suffolk?
- It cannot come soon enough for me.
- I agree.
The war will be a chance for us
to exceed
even the glories of Henry V
at Azincourt.
- And you, My Lord Surrey?
- Majesty, my kind always
desires the honor of the field.
And what better field than France?
Aye.
Do you play cards, Lady Latimer?
Yes, Your Majesty. I do.
Good.
The King seems quite taken
with Lady Latimer.
It's true.
And we know that when he takes
a fancy to a person or a thing,
he usually goes the whole way.
Perhaps that is why he's so happy.
My Lord,
what happened to those musicians
who were arrested?
Gardiner examined them.
He was not satisfied
with their answers,
all three have been transferred
to the Tower.
May I ask why Your Grace is curious?
Yes. You may ask.
Excuse me, brother.
Your hand, my Lady.
Your prize.
- No, Your Majesty.
- Please.
Your Majesty, I couldn't.
Look inside.
Majesty,
although I am so touched,
and flattered,
I cannot accept this ring.
Please...
accept this for me.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I have news for you.
- Majesty?
- I'm sending you to Brussels,
on embassy to the court
of the Regent of the Netherlands.
Does it please you, Sir Thomas?
I'm...
I'm very grateful to Your Majesty.
Good.
Is Your Majesty considering
another marriage?
Perhaps.
- And a war in France?
- For certain.
- Do you really want to fight again?
- Yes.
Don't you?
I thought you did.
- ... take another wife?
- Yes.
Am I not still able?
To have a wife?
To have more children?
To be myself?
<i>Requiem aeternum dona es Domine,</i>
<i>et Lux perpetua Au luceat.</i>
John, I need to say
something to you.
Go to hell...
<i>In nomine Patris et Filii et
Spiritus Sancti. Amen.</i>
Catherine Parr,
we are sent here
by the King's Majesty to offer you,
after your days of mourning
for your late husband are complete,
his Majesty's hand in marriage.
His Majesty esteems you
above all other women in his kingdom
and hopes to find you well disposed
towards his offer,
in which case he will be
the happiest man in England,
and you the happiest woman.

- Voulez-vous la guerre ?
- Oui.
- Vous remarier ?
- Oui.
Ne suis-je pas capable
d'avoir une épouse, des enfants ?
D'être moi-même ?
Je ne me retire pas d'une bataille
où les Français m'ont provoqué.
L'Empereur est de nouveau en guerre.
Une alliance contre la France
permettrait à l'Angleterre
de regagner ses anciens territoires,
l'Aquitaine toute entière.
Je pense que le Roi
voudra se remarier.
Mais quelle femme
voudrait épouser un roi
qui répudie ses épouses ou les tue ?
Lady Latimer prie Votre Majesté
de blanchir le nom de son époux.
Lady Latimer fait impression au Roi.
Aucun enfant
de votre premier époux ?
C'était une union malheureuse.
- Le contraire existe-t-il ?
- Je le crois de tout mon cœur.
Nous devrions traquer
tous les luthériens du royaume.
Les forcer à se montrer ?
Certains sont très proches du Roi.
N'aimeriez-vous pas être reine ?
Vous savez ce qui arrive
à ses reines ! Tout le monde le sait.
Que chacun sache que ce traité
nous engage
dans une guerre contre la France.
Sa Majesté accepte
d'y envoyer 40 000 soldats.
Dieu m'en est témoin.
Comment l'Empereur
pourrait-il oublier
les insultes du Roi d'Angleterre ?

Messires,
nous continuons à préparer
l'invasion de la France.
Nous débuterons
par la prise stratégique de Boulogne.
Votre Grâce,
je vous nomme
commandant de nos armées,
si vous avez le désir
de mener cette bataille.
Je remercie Dieu de cette occasion
d'acquérir honneur et gloire.
Qui ne préfèrerait mourir
l'épée à la main,
dans un dernier cri,
plutôt que dans son lit ?
Messires,
Je dois vous informer
qu'un émissaire de l'Empereur,
le Duc de Najera,
nous rendra une visite informelle,
en l'honneur de notre alliance.
Le Duc est l'un des meilleurs généraux
de l'Empereur.
Il doit être reçu d'abord
par le Comte de Surrey,
puis introduit à la cour.
Vos Grâces sauront l'accueillir
comme il se doit.
J'ai fait vœu d'obtenir
la reddition du Roi François
et je tiendrai cette promesse.
Je suis un prince vertueux
et honorable,

et je ne me suis jamais dédit.
Je ne commencerai pas à mon âge.

Merci, Lady Herbert.
Ma sœur.
Votre Majesté, puis-je ?
Je suis résolue à être une belle-mère
aimante pour vos enfants.
Je connais Mary depuis longtemps
et ce serait un plaisir,
bien plus qu'un devoir,
d'avoir l'amitié du Prince Edward
et de la Princesse Elizabeth.
Si Votre Majesté l'autorise,
j'aimerais les inviter
plus souvent à la cour.
Pas uniquement pour moi,
mais aussi pour qu'ils puissent
voir leur père plus souvent.
Vous avez ma permission.
Merci.
Votre Majesté accepterait peut-être
que Lady Elizabeth loge à la cour,
comme Lady Mary ?
Peut-être.
Mais je ne veux pas que Edward
y vienne trop souvent,
à cause des contagions.
Des cadeaux
vous seront apportés de ma part.
Pour votre plaisir, j'espère.
Merci.
De rien.
Essayez celui-ci.
- Votre Grâce.
- Messires.
J'ai le plaisir de vous transmettre
les ordres du Roi.
Sir Thomas, vous n'allez plus
à Bruxelles,
vous êtes nommé
Amiral de notre flotte.
Messire Surrey, le Roi vous fait
Maréchal des armées,
un grand honneur.
Votre Grâce.
- Quand partons-nous ?
- Dès que le Roi l'ordonnera.
Est-il vrai que votre frère,
Lord Hertford,
- est opposé à la guerre ?
- C'est vrai, Votre Grâce.
Il s'inquiète pour la santé
physique et spirituelle du Roi.
Si Sa Majesté devait mourir
en France,
le royaume serait fortement ébranlé.
Comment va le Roi ?
Des rumeurs le disent souffrant.
Peut-être incapable
de guider l'armée.
Non, Messire, le roi mènera
ses soldats. Soyez-en assuré.
À vrai dire, le Roi
ne veut pas uniquement
reconquérir la France,
mais également son honneur
et sa jeunesse.
En cela, il est comme moi.
Puis-je vous présenter Son Altesse
Don Juan Estaban Manrique de Lara,
Duc de Najera.
- Votre Altesse.
- Votre Majesté.
Je suis ravi de vous accueillir.
J'espère que l'on aura su
vous divertir ?
Divertir ?
Parle-t-il de notre visite ?
Tout à fait.
J'ai visité la célèbre Tour
et vu également la Tamise.
Il ne peut y avoir selon moi
de plus beau fleuve au monde.
Et avec tant de...
- <i>cisnes ?</i>
- Cygnes, Altesse.
Oui. Des Cygnes.
Messire Surrey a aussi accompagné
Son Altesse aux Jardins de Paris,
voir des combats d'ours
et de chiens.
Puis, dans ce même lieu,
ils ont fait venir un poney
monté par un singe.
Voir l'animal ruer au milieu
des chiens, avec les cris du singe,
était très amusant.
Eh bien, Altesse,
je pense que vous serez ce soir
agréablement diverti
par ma belle épouse, la Reine,
et ma fille aînée, Lady Mary.
Son Altesse désire seulement
que Votre Majesté confirme
que vos armées sont prêtes
à envahir la France.
J'ai déjà donné ma parole.
Que voulez-vous de plus ?
<i>Son Altesse, le Duc de Najera.</i>
Lady Mary.
Votre Altesse.
C'est un tel privilège
et plaisir de vous accueillir
à la cour de mon père.
Nul n'ignore votre renommée
comme général des armées impériales.
Vous parlez espagnol, Lady Mary ?
Oui, un peu.
Ne suis-je pas la fille de ma mère ?
Est-ce une coïncidence qu'au moment
où l'on parle de guerre
le Général Najera
fasse irruption à la cour ?
Absolument.
C'est une visite privée.
Son Altesse est venue à Londres
voir la Tour,
canoter sur la Tamise,
voir les cygnes.
Me prenez-vous pour un imbécile ?
Non, Excellence.
Nous sommes tous deux...
ce que nous sommes.
Kat, ne puis-je pas danser ?
S'il vous plaît !
Bien sûr que si.
Vous pouvez danser, My Lady.
M. Risley,
que savez-vous des convictions
religieuses de la Reine ?
Les mêmes, certainement,
que celles du Roi.
Je ne crois pas.
Je soupçonne Sa Majesté
d'être secrètement protestante
et j'ai l'intention
de le prouver un jour.
En faisant cela,
vous encourez la colère du Roi.
M. Risley,
au nom de notre foi
et de l'avenir de notre pays,
je suis prêt
à prendre de grands risques.
Dr Butts ! Qu'y a-t-il ?
La jambe du Roi, Majesté. Son ulcère
s'est ouvert, il souffre beaucoup.
Venez.
Catherine.
Bien-aimé,
- laissez-moi regarder.
- Non, par pitié.
J'ai vu pire que cela.
Donnez-moi un cataplasme. Vite.
Si vous pouviez bouger la jambe
et la placer sur mes genoux...
Voilà, mon bien-aimé.
Dépêchez !
Tant que le Roi sera malade,
je dormirai dans sa chambre,
afin de veiller sur lui.
Suivant !
Halte !
En avant.
Allons, les gars.
J'ai fait la guerre,
il y a longtemps.
Avec des lances. C'était ainsi
que les chevaliers se battaient.
Ceci...
c'est différent.
Une guerre d'artillerie.
- Bien visé.
- Encore.
Excellent tir.
Bravo. Ton nom ?
Richard, Votre Grâce,
Richard Leland.
Tu pars à la guerre, Leland.
Beau tir, Richard.
Harry. Harry Hurst.
- Pars-tu pour la France ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Je ne tire pas aussi bien.
- Que sais-tu faire ?
Je suis fermier.
Je sais mener les vaches, ramasser
la merde, faire une clôture.
Seigneur !
J'aimerais avoir tes talents !
Merci.
Suivant.
Votre Majesté,
le Prince Edward.
Votre Grâce,
je suis ravie de vous voir.
Madame,
je vous remercie pour les tenues
en velours cramoisi et satin blanc
que vous m'avez offertes.
Je suis heureuse
que vous les aimiez.
Je désire également remercier
mon noble et illustre père
pour les bijoux qu'il m'a envoyés.
On m'a dit qu'il était malade.
Je suis heureuse de vous annoncer
que Sa Majesté va beaucoup mieux.
Il doit m'aimer,
car s'il ne m'aimait pas,
il ne m'enverrait pas
ces beaux cadeaux.
Il vous aime énormément.
Vous lui êtes très cher
et je sais qu'il aimerait
vous voir plus souvent.
Merci.
Bonne journée, Madame.
Pauvre enfant.
Messires.
Où en sont nos préparatifs ?
Je trouve que cela n'avance pas !
J'en arrive à penser
que Vos Grâces ne sont pas pressées
de faire la guerre.
Assis.
Majesté, les affûts de canon,
les chariots,
les chevaux, l'artillerie
et les fusils
sont expédiés
et prêts à être embarqués.
300 navires ont été réquisitionnés
au nom de Votre Majesté
et seront ici dans le mois.
Dans le mois !
Ils seraient déjà là,
si vous n'aviez pas autant
négligé vos fonctions.
Et les plans de Boulogne ?
Votre Majesté,
nous n'avons aucun plan.
Nous devrons nous fier aux conseils
d'un espion français,
De Buren.
Nous allons donc avancer à tâtons
et nous en remettre
à des espions français !
Dieu nous vienne en aide,
car Votre Grâce ne nous aide pas !
Nous n'attendrons pas les navires.
L'armée embarquera pour la France
dans dix jours,
arrivera à Calais et se dirigera
directement sur Boulogne.
Nous avons trois semaines pour prendre
la ville avant de marcher sur Paris.
Tant que je serai en France,
Son Altesse la Reine Catherine
assurera la régence
et gouvernera à ma place.
Lord Hertford, que je crois
opposé à cette guerre,
restera en tant que
Lieutenant du royaume.
Dois-je vous rappeler
que nous n'allons pas en France
seulement pour l'honneur et la gloire
mais pour reconquérir
nos droits et héritages
dont nous avons été spoliés.
Et dont nous avons longtemps
été privés.
Il a fait de la Reine sa régente.
Pourquoi ?
Elle ne sait pas gérer un état.
Je l'ignore.
Mais je pense
que c'est une mauvaise chose.
Le Roi devrait savoir
combien il est dangereux
de serrer un serpent
contre son cœur.
Je dois vous dire
que j'ai tout arrangé
au cas où je ne reviendrais pas.
Le Parlement fera bientôt passer
un nouvel acte de succession
faisant d'Edward mon héritier.
Sans propre descendance,
la succession passe à Lady Mary,
puis à Lady Elizabeth.
Ce sont mes volontés.
C'est entendu.
Ne pleurez pas,
je n'ai pas l'intention de mourir.
Promettez-moi de m'écrire souvent.
Dites-moi ce qui se passe
dans mon royaume
et tout qu'il vous plaira d'écrire.
Je laisse mes enfants
sous votre garde,
sachant qu'il n'est personne
de plus aimant que vous.
Adieu.
Voilà qui rend heureux
d'être en vie, Majesté.
Votre Grâce.
- Majesté.
- Content de vous voir.
Où en sommes-nous ?
Majesté, le port est bloqué
et la ville partiellement investie.
Ses portes sont fermées,
ses défenseurs sont à l'intérieur.
Les Français pensent
que leurs remparts et leurs doubles murs
les rendent invulnérables
à notre artillerie.
Nous allons voir.
Nous avons assez de canons
pour conquérir l'enfer.
En avant !
J'en crois pas mes yeux.
Regarde, Richard !
Le Roi d'Angleterre en personne !
Qu'en dis-tu ?
Si j'étais français,
je serais effrayé.
Anglais, vous avez toutes les raisons
d'être fiers !
Aujourd'hui,
débute notre campagne de Boulogne.
Nous avons offert la paix
en échange de nos droits
et successions.
Mais notre ennemi
a refusé de nous les rendre.
Ils devraient savoir
que nous avons du courage,
que nous combattrons jusqu'à la mort,
pour la justice.
Ces terres nous ont été arrachées
par la violence,
et je vais les récupérer.
Pour le Roi Henry,
pour l'Angleterre,
et pour St George !
Longue vie au Roi !
Pour l'Angleterre !

Faites expédier ceci
à Messire Hertford.
Merci.
Madame,
voici Monsieur Latimer.
Hélas Madame,
je ne porte plus ce nom.
J'ai été privé de mon évêché
par l'évêque Gardiner.
Je sais.
Et je sais de quelle manière.
J'ai quand même décidé
de faire de vous
mon aumônier personnel.
En êtes-vous certaine, My Lady ?
Vous devez connaître ma réputation.
Votre réputation est celle d'un homme
au fait des Évangiles
et d'un vrai chrétien.
Par exemple, croyez-vous
que ce soit une mauvaise chose
que chacun soit capable
de lire la Bible ?
Au contraire, je pense
que c'est essentiel.
Car, sans la parole directe de Dieu,
nous serions des illettrés
restant dans l'ignorance,
et sans grâce.
Même si certains disent
que la lecture de la Bible
conduit à l'hérésie ?
S'ils le disent,
alors ils entachent
la parole sacrée de Dieu,
- avec des offenses d'homme.
- Vous avez raison.
Les gens refusent-ils de la nourriture
car d'autres meurent de faim ?
N'utilisent-ils pas de feu,
même si la maison voisine a brûlé ?
C'est par ignorance qu'on dénigre Dieu
pour des erreurs humaines.
Si vous désirez toujours m'avoir,
je serai heureux
d'être votre aumônier.
Je vous remercie.
J'ai une requête.
Que vous dissimuliez
vos vrais travaux
aux yeux de Lady Mary.
Pour rien au monde,
elle ne trahirait sa loyauté
à la foi de sa mère,
et je respecte cela.
Madame, croyez-moi,
je serai très discret
dans mes échanges
avec les enfants de Sa Majesté
et avec le monde.
Merci.
Ma sœur,
êtes-vous sûre
de la discrétion de M. Latimer ?
Je ne devrais pas le dire
à Votre Majesté,
mais je crains cette nomination.
Devrais-je être lâche ?
Vous savez
que je ne voulais pas épouser le Roi.
Mais comme c'est fait,
je peux maintenant
utiliser mon influence
pour servir la cause
à laquelle je crois de tout mon cœur.
La cause de la Réforme !
Cela me permettra
de m'adresser à Dieu,
la conscience tranquille
et l'âme en paix.
Dites-moi que vous comprenez, Anne.
S'il vous plaît.
En avant ! Allez ! Gauche, droite !
Nous y sommes !
Merde !
Ça peut durer longtemps.
Garçons, venez ici !
Allez !
Allez !
Par ici, My Lord.
Votre Majesté, Signor Treviso.
Girolamo.
Montrez-moi
où vous creuserez pour les mines.
Je veux creuser trois tunnels.
Deux pour créer une diversion
et perturber l'ennemi.
Le principal ici,
qui mènera sous le château.
La durée ?
Cela dépend de la terre,
et des dangers d'inondation.
Ainsi que de la profondeur
des fondations.
Nous pourrions être sous le château
pour une explosion
dans trois semaines.
Deux semaines, Signor Treviso.
Deux semaines.
Prenez le nécessaire.
Allez-y à fond, les gars.
Nous progressons vite.
Je veux savoir ce que fait l'Empereur
depuis le début de cette guerre.
Les forces de l'Empereur assiègent
la forteresse de Luxembourg
et St Didier.
Avec l'aide de Dieu,
nous serons les premiers à Paris.
Avec les dégâts infligés
par nos canons,
je pense
que Boulogne ne tiendra pas longtemps.
Les Français sont assez fous
pour croire leurs murs indestructibles.
Ils n'ont pas vu nos canons.
Paris en septembre. Bien.
Il y a beaucoup de Parisiens
que je voudrais tuer,
pour coucher avec leurs femmes,
la conscience tranquille.
- <i>Santé !</i>
- <i>Santé !</i>
- Majesté.
- Un problème ?
Les Français ont fait
une percée porte Sud.
- J'y vais !
- Votre Grâce !
Surveillez les portes,
au cas où ce serait une diversion.
- Oui !
- Majesté.
Où sont-ils ?
Là ! Là ! Attrapez-le !
Au nom du Roi, arrêtez !
- Où est-il ?
- Dans le fossé !
Gardez l'œil ouvert.
À couvert !
Ne bougez plus !
- Vous le voyez ?
- Hommes à terre !
Prêts ?
Allons-y !
Votre Grâce,
Je n'avais pas besoin d'aide,
mais merci.
Je vous les laisse ?
À l'attaque !
Pour l'Angleterre !
Mademoiselle ?
Chargez les canons !
- Général.
- Maintenez les lignes.
Creusez là.
Je vous ai apporté à manger.
Votre père est vivant.
C'est vrai.
Il a été blessé, mais on le soigne.
- Puis-je le voir ?
- Bientôt.
Je le promets.
<i>Allez-y à fond.
Faites rouler ce baril !</i>
Votre nom ?
Vous devriez manger.
Que faites-vous ici ?
En France ?
Ce n'est pas votre pays.
Ça l'était.
Nous avons vécu au Jardin d'Eden
mais nous n'y retournons pas.
- Pourquoi ne pas me relâcher ?
- Pour nous combattre ?
Oui, pour pouvoir vous tuer.
Non, Mademoiselle.
Vous êtes ma prisonnière.
Je pourrais obtenir une rançon.
Ça va, en ville ?
On mange à sa faim ?
Oui !
Ne vous en inquiétez pas.
Ils ne se rendront pas.
Pas à ce monstre, votre Roi.
Monstre ?
On l'appelle le Néron Anglais !
Vous l'ignoriez ?
<i>Graci plena. Dominus tecum.</i>
<i>Benedicta tu in mulieribus,</i>
<i>et benedictus fructus ventris tui.</i>
M. Risley.
Votre Grâce.
J'ai des nouvelles
qui pourraient vous intéresser.
Il semble
que la Reine a nommé Hugh Latimer
comme aumônier privé.
C'est sûr ?
Pourtant quelqu'un m'a dit
que c'était une femme intelligente.
Le tunnel avance ?
On a creusé sur cinquante pas.
C'est un travail pénible,
et il y a beaucoup d'argile.
Je préfère l'argile au sable.
J'ai peur que la terre s'effondre
et nous ensevelisse.
Et toi ?
Un officier français sort parfois.
Il se tient debout
derrière les remparts du château
et nous regarde.
Puis il rentre.
J'aurais juste besoin d'un tir.
Juste un tir.
Le sais-tu ?
Il y a quelques femmes
autour du camp.
Pas beaucoup, quelques-unes.
- C'est ce que j'ai appris.
- Tu attraperas la variole !
Tu as peut-être raison.
En tout cas,
une femme m'attend à mon retour,
et elle est enceinte.
Tu veux un garçon ou une fille ?
Un garçon.
Je prie Dieu
qu'on ne s'éternise pas.
"Bien que Votre Majesté soit partie
depuis peu,
"le désir de votre présence
"fait que je n'ai de plaisir en rien
"jusqu'à ce que
j'aie des nouvelles."
<i>Le temps me paraît long.</i>
<i>J'ai un grand désir de savoir</i>
<i>comment va Votre Majesté
depuis son départ.</i>
<i>Je souhaite et désire pour vous</i>
<i>plus que pour moi-même,
prospérité et santé.</i>
<i>Même si je sais que vous ne

"l'amour et l'affection

Majesté, je vous prie
de nous donner plus de temps.
Les hommes travaillent jour et nuit.
Mais parfois, nous devons arrêter
de creuser pour étayer,
afin d'éviter que tout s'effondre.
Maître chirurgien !
Signor Treviso.
- Un problème ?
- Majesté,
J'ai le regret de vous informer
de la mort de dix soldats.
- Ils meurent de leurs blessures.
- Non, Votre Majesté.
Ils sont morts de flux sanglant.
La dysenterie ?
Je crains une hécatombe
au sein de votre armée.
Dieu seul sait combien succomberont.
Maître chirurgien.
M. Treviso.
Je peux vous poser une question ?
Que pensez-vous
du Signor Girolamo Treviso ?
Le constructeur de tunnels.
- Comment ça ?
- Peut-on lui faire confiance ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Je viens d'apprendre
qu'il y a quelque temps,
il a dit pouvoir construire
un grand miroir
que l'on mettrait
sur les falaises de Douvres.
Sa Majesté serait capable
d'y voir se refléter
le mouvement des navires français,
entrant et sortant
du port de Boulogne.
Vous voyez où je veux en venir ?
Vous le croyez fou ?
Ce n'est qu'une suggestion.
Mais alors,
ce n'est pas le seul.
<i>Relayez la garde !</i>
<i>Section prête !</i>
<i>Tirez vers le haut !</i>
<i>Prêt, capitaine !</i>
<i>Previously on</i> The Tudors...
- Do you really want to fight?
- Yes.
- Take another wife?
- Yes.
Am I not still able to have a wife,
to have more children?
To be myself?
I mean to show these French that I won't
shy away from battle if I am provoked.
The Emperor is once more at war.
A joint attack on France would
restore to the English crown
all your lost territories,
the whole of Aquitaine.
I still think the King
will want to remarry.
And yet what woman on earth
would want to marry a King
who either puts his wives away
or kills them?
Lady Latimer has come
to petition Your Majesty
to lift a suspicion of treason
from her husband.
The King seems quite taken
with Lady Latimer.
You have no children
and none by your first husband?
It was not a happy marriage.
- Do you think such a thing exists?
- I believe so with all my heart.
We should start hunting down all
the Lutherans in His Majesty's kingdom.
We should flush them out?
Some of them are very close
to the King.
You would not like
to be Queen of England?
You know what happens to his queens!
Everyone knows what happens.
Let it be known to all
present that this treaty
contains an obligation to undertake
a war against France.
His Majesty agrees to send
40,000 men-at-arms.
I do, so help me God.
What could make a revengeful prince
like the Emperor?
Forget the insult done to him
by the King of England?
Those insults are long forgotten,
Monsieur Marillac.
Catherine Parr, we are sent here
by the King's Majesty to offer you
His Majesty's hand in marriage.
He will be the happiest man
now alive in England,
and you the happiest woman.

Tr.: YYets.
My Lords,
we will now proceed with our plans
for an invasion of France.
We will start by the capture
of the strategic town of Boulogne.
Your Grace,
I shall appoint you
commander of our armies,
if you have the will
and the stomach for the fight.
I can only thank God for the chance
to win honour and glory in the field.
What man wouldn't prefer to die
with a sword in his hand
and a cry in his throat,
rather than abed in England?
Aye!
My Lords,
I must tell you that a special envoy
from the court of the Emperor,
the Duke of Najera,
will pay us an unofficial visit,
in honour of our alliance.
The Duke is one of the Emperor's
most successful generals.
He should be first received
here by the Earl of Surrey
and then brought to court.
I'm sure your Lordships will see fit
to welcome him as he deserves.
I have vowed to bring King Francis
into submission,
and I will fulfil this promise.
I have been all my life
a prince of virtue and honour,
as you can all attest,
and I have never
contravened my word.
I'm too old to begin now.
"I, Catherine
"take thee, Henry,
"to be my wedded husband,
"to have and to hold
from this day forward,
"for better, for worse,
"for richer, for poorer,
"in sickness and in health,
"to be bonnier and buxom
in bed and at board,
"till death us do part,
"and thereto
I plight thee my troth."
The ring.
<i>"Benedicat, hic anulum,</i>
<i>"Dominus,
qui fecit caelum et terram."</i>
"With this ring, I thee wed."
"With my body,
"I thee worship."
<i>"In nomine Patris,</i>
<i>"et Filii,</i>
<i>"et Spiritus Sancti."</i>
I now pronounce thee man and wife.
Thank you, Lady Herbert.
Sister.
Your Majesty, if I may?
I am determined to be a loving
stepmother to your children.
Of course, I have known Mary
for years,
but it would now be
my pleasure rather than my duty
to make friends with the Prince Edward
and the Princess Elizabeth.
So with Your Majesty's permission
I would like to invite
them more often to court,
not only for my sake
but so they might more often
see their father.
You have my permission.
Thank you.
And perhaps Your Majesty
might also agree
to the Lady Elizabeth having permanent
lodgings at court, like the Lady Mary?
Perhaps.
But I would not like my son Edward
to come to court too often,
for fear of infection.
I have arranged for some gifts
to be delivered to you.
I hope you like them.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Try this one, Your Grace.
- Your Grace.
- My Lords.
I am pleased to convey to you
His Majesty's commissions.
Sir Thomas, you are recalled
from Brussels
and are to be appointed
Admiral of the Fleet.
My Lord Surrey, the King has seen fit
to make you Marshal of the Field,
a singular honour.
Your Grace.
- When do we sail?
- As soon as the King commands.
Sir Thomas...
Is it true that your brother,
Lord Hertford
- is against this war?
- It is true, Your Grace.
He worries for the King's health,
in body and in mind.
He fears that if His Majesty
should die in France,
he would leave the kingdom
in great confusion.
How is the King?
There are rumours that he is unwell.
That he may be unable
to lead the army.
No, my Lord. The King will lead
his soldiers. Make no mistake of that.
For here is the truth,
the King does not
just want France back,
but all of his honour
and his youth as well.
And, in that, he is like me.
May I present His Highness
Don Juan Estaban Manrique de Lara,
Duke of Najera.
- Your Highness.
- Your Majesty.
I am very happy to receive you
at my court.
I trust you have been
well entertained so far?
Indeed. I have visited
the famous Tower
and also the River Thames.
It is not possible that a more beautiful
river should exist in the world.
And with so many...
- <i>cisnes?</i>
- Swans, your Highness.
Yes. Swans.
My Lord Surrey also took
His Highness to the Paris Gardens,
to see bears fighting with dogs.
And then, in the same place,
they brought a pony
with an ape on his back.
And to see the animal kicking among
the dogs, with the screams of the ape
was very laughable.
Well, Your Highness,
I trust this evening you will also
be well entertained
by my beautiful wife the Queen
and my first daughter, the Lady Mary.
His Highness only desires
Your Majesty to confirm
if your armies are ready
for the invasion of France.
I have already given my word.
What more does Your Highness
expect of me?
<i>His Highness, the Duke of Najera.</i>
The Lady Mary.
So, is it a coincidence
that there is talk of war
and then General Najera
turns up here at court?
Absolutely.
This is a private visit.
His Highness came to London
to see the Tower
and row on the river
and see the swans.
Do you take me for a fool?
No, Excellency.
You are what you are.
And so am I.
Kat! May I not dance, please!
Of course you can.
Of course you can dance, my Lady.
Mr. Risley,
may I ask, what have you heard
of the Queen's religious beliefs?
They are the same, surely,
as His Majesty's.
I think not.
Indeed, I suspect Her Majesty
of being a secret Protestant
and I intend one day to prove it.
And in so doing...
risk the anger of the King?
Mr. Risley,
for the sake of our faith,
and the future of our country
I am prepared to risk a great deal.
Dr. Butts! What is it?
It's the King's leg, Your Majesty. His
ulcer has burst, he is in great pain.
Come.
Catherine!
Dearest,
- let me see!
- Please, don't.
I have seen worse things.
Give me a poultice, quickly now.
If Your Majesty could move your leg,
and place it across my lap?
There, dearest.
Quickly!
As long as the King is sick,
I will move my bed to his chamber,
the better to look after him.
Madam.
Next!
Steady!
Forward.
Come on, lads.
I went to war once, a long time ago.
We broke lances against the French.
The knights did in the old days.
This...
this is a different war,
a war of guns.
- Good shot.
- Again.
Good shooting.
Well done. What's your name?
Richard, Your Grace, Richard Leland.
You are soon to war, Richard Leland.
That was well done, Richard.
Harry. Harry Hurst.
- Are you coming to France?
- I don't know.
- I can't shoot like that.
- What can you do?
I'm a farm labourer, me.
I can herd cows, shovel shit,
and build fences.
Christ!
I wish I'd half your talent, Harry!
Thank you.
Next.
Your Majesty,
Prince Edward is here.
Madam.
Your Grace, how lovely to see you.
Madam, I came to thank you
for the outfits
of crimson velvet and white satin
you sent me.
I am very glad that you liked them.
I would also like to thank
my noble and illustrious father
for the jewels he sent me.
But they told me he was sick.
I am pleased to tell Your Grace
that His Majesty is now much better.
He must love me,
for if he did not love me,
he would not give me
these fine gifts.
He loves you very much.
You are very special to him
and I know that he would like
to see you more often if he could.
Thank you.
I wish you a good day, Madam.
Poor child.
My Lords.
How go our preparations?
I think they have gone slackly!
I'm beginning to suppose
your Lordships are not so keen
to go to war after all.
Sit.
Majesty, the gun carriages,
carts, wagons,
the ovens, horses,
artillery, and ordnance
are all made ready
and dispatched for shipping.
And a further 300 ships have been
requisitioned for Your Majesty's use
and will be in port
within the month.
Within the month!
They should be already in port
if you had not been so remiss
and neglectful in your duties!
What about our maps of Boulogne?
Your Majesty,
we do not have any maps,
so we will have to rely
on the advice of a French spy,
De Buren.
So we are to blunder
about in the dark
and trust to the honesty
of French spies!
God help us, Your Grace,
for it seems you have not!
We will not wait for more ships!
This army will embark
for France in 10 days time,
land in Calais and straight away
march to Boulogne.
We have three weeks to take this town
before we proceed on to Paris.
Now, while I am in France,
the Queen's Highness, Queen Catherine
will act as Regent
and rule in my stead.
Lord Hertford, who I begin
to suspect is against this war,
will stay as Lieutenant
to the Realm.
Need I remind your Lordships
that we go to France not solely
for honour and glory,
but to recover our just rights
and inheritances
taken from us by violence
and withheld from us for too long.
He has made the Queen Regent!
Why?
She has no knowledge
of matters of state!
I do not know.
But from what I hear of her,
I do not think it right.
I think the King should be aware
how perilous a matter it is
to cherish a serpent
in one's own bosom.
I have to tell you that I've left
all things here in order,
in case do not come back
from France.
Shortly, Parliament will
pass a new Act of Succession,
naming my son Edward as my heir.
If he has no issue,
then it passes to the Lady Mary
and then to the Lady Elizabeth.
Those are my wishes.
Understood.
Do not cry, Mary,
for I do not intend to die.
Promise you will write to me often!
Tell me all that happens
in my kingdom
and whatever you see fit to write.
I leave my children in your care,
knowing that there are not
more loving hands in this world.
Farewell.
It makes you happy to be alive,
doesn't it, Majesty?
Your Grace.
Majesty.
Well met!
How do we prosper?
Majesty, the port is blockaded
and the town is partially invested.
Its gates are shut
and its defenders shut inside.
The French consider
that their ramparts and double walls
make them invulnerable
to our artillery!
We shall see about that!
We have brought enough
cannon here to conquer hell!
Forward!
I can't believe my eyes
Look, Richard!
It's the King of England himself!
What do you think?
I reckon if I were the French
I'd be fucking scared.
Englishmen, today you have
every reason to be proud!
Today, we begin
our campaign of Boulogne.
We have offered terms of peace
in return for our just rights
and inheritances.
But our enemy has refused
to render what they owe us.
They should know that we do not
lack the courage to fight
to the death for justice.
These lands were taken from us
by violence
and I mean to have them back.
For King Henry,
for England,
and for St. George!
Long live the King!
For England!
Prepare your fire!
Solders, to your stations!
Section One Commander!
Prepare your guns!
Section One, prepare your guns!
Section Two Commander!
Prepare your guns!
Load your cannon!
- Prepare your guns!
- Ready, guns.
Section Three Commander!
Prepare your guns!
Ram barrel!
- Soldiers, into the trenches!
- Quick march!
Section Two Commander,
take both your men!
- Section Three, report when ready.
- Yes, sir!
- Section Three ready.
- That's ready, sir.
All guns take aim
for the gates and castle.
Section One, take aim!
- Section Commanders!
- Confirm you have your target!
Section Three, take aim.
Section One, target ready.
Section Two, confirm target.
Section Two has target, sir.
- Section Three, confirm.
- Section Three ready.
Hold sections!
Hold fire until I give the order!
Let's go, men.
Hold fire!
Move!
Hold your fire!
Easy for the time!
Now we'll see how invulnerable
it really is!
In position!
Ready, captain!
Section one, fire!
For the King!
- Ready!
- Ready!
All sections!
Fire!
Section One, fire!
Ready!
Charge the gun!
- England!
- England!
Back into position!
Reload all guns!
If you could see that this is
delivered to My Lord Hertford.
Thank you.
Madam,
here is Mr. Latimer.
Alas, Madam, I am no longer
entitled to such an address.
I was deprived of my bishopric
by Bishop Gardiner.
I know.
And I know the circumstances of it.
Still, I have a mind
to appoint you
chaplain to my household.
Are you absolutely sure, My Lady?
You must know my reputation.
Your reputation, Mr. Latimer,
is of a man of the Gospels
and a true Christian.
For example, do you suppose
that it is a bad thing
that everyone should be able
to read the Bible for themselves?
On the contrary, I believe it
to be a vital thing.
For without God's direct word
we that be unlettered
remain confused and without grace.
Even though some would say
that the reading of the Bible
leads to heresy?
If they say so,
then they are wickedly charging
the holy sanctified word of God
- with the offences of man.
- You are right.
Do people deny themselves food,
because they see others overeat?
Or avoid using fire because they have
seen a neighbour's house burn down?
Blind ignorance, Mr. Latimer,
to slander God for man's offences.
If you are still of a mind
to have me,
I will most joyfully
be your chaplain.
I thank you.
I have one favour,
which is that you conceal
the true workings
of your mind from the Lady Mary.
For nothing in this world
will change her allegiance
to the faith of her mother,
and I respect her for that.
Madam, believe me,
I shall be the soul of discretion
in my dealings
with all His Majesty's children,
and with the world.
Thank you.
My Lady.
Sister,
are you sure you can really trust
Mr. Latimer's discretion?
I know I should not say so
to Your Majesty,
but I fear his appointment.
Should I play the coward?
You know that I never wanted
to marry the King.
But since I had to,
I may at least use
what influence I now possess
to further the cause
that I believe in with all my heart.
The cause of the Reformation!
Then at least I can address my God
with a clear conscience
and an honest soul.
Please say
that you understand, Anne!
Please.
Forward! Come on! Left, right.
There we are!
Shit!
It can't last forever.
Lads, come here!
Come on!
Move on, men!
This way, My Lord.
Your Majesty, signor Treviso.
Girolamo.
Come, show me where you intend
to dig these mines.
I intend to dig three tunnels.
Two will be a diversion,
to confuse the enemy.
The main one will be here,
which will lead under the castle.
How long?
That depends on the type of ground,
danger of flooding and so on.
Also, how far into the earth
they have built the walls.
But I say we could
be under the castle
and able to detonate
a huge explosion in three weeks.
Two weeks, signor Treviso!
Two weeks!
Take the troops you need.
Put your backs into it, men.
We are making excellent progress.
But I want to know how the Emperor
is doing since we are in this war.
The Emperor's forces
are at present besieging
the fortresses of Luxembourg
and St. Didier.
With God's help, we will break
our siege first and advance on Paris.
With the damage our guns
are inflicting,
I swear Boulogne will
not hold out for long.
I think that the French were foolish to
think that their walls were invincible.
They had not seen our guns.
Paris by September! Good!
There are a lot of Frenchmen
in Paris I would like to kill,
so I can sleep with their wives
with a clear conscience!
Gentlemen
- <i>Salut!</i>
- <i>Salut!</i>
- Majesty.
- What is it?
The French! They've broken out
beyond the southern gate, sir.
- I'll go!
- Your Grace!
Cover the gates with a massive force,
in case this is a diversion.
- Go!
- Majesty.
Where are they?
There, there! Get him!
Stop in the name of the King!
- Where is he?
- He's down in the ditch!
Keep your wits about you.
Take cover!
Stay down!
- Do you see him?
- Two on the ground!
Ready!
Let's go!
Your Grace,
I didn't need your help
but thank you all the same.
Shall I leave them to you then?
Here we come!
For England!
Mademoiselle?
Load cannon!
- General.
- Keep the lines straight.
Dig in there.
I've brought you some food.
Your father is still alive.
Is that true?
He was wounded
but we're taking care of him.
- Can I see him?
- Soon.
I promise.
<i>Put your backs into it.
Roll that barrel!</i>
What's your name?
Brigitte,
Brigitte Rousselot.
You should eat.
Why are you here?
In France?
This isn't your country.
It used to be.
We all used to live in Eden.
It doesn't mean we can go back again!
- Why won't you release me?
- So you'll fight against us?
Yes! So I can go on killing you.
No, Mademoiselle.
You're my prisoner now.
Perhaps I'll even get
a ransom for you!
How things are in the town?
Do people have enough food?
They have plenty!
You shouldn't worry about them.
They'll never surrender.
Not to that sacred monster,
your King.
Monster?
You know
we call him the English Nero!
Didn't you know that?
<i>Graci plena. Dominus tecum.</i>
<i>Benedicta tu in mulieribus,</i>
<i>et benedictus fructus ventris tui.</i>
Mr. Risley.
Your Grace,
I have some news I thought
you might be interested in.
It seems
Queen Catherine has appointed
Hugh Latimer as her private Chaplain.
Are you sure?
And I thought someone said
she was an intelligent woman!
How's the tunnelling?
We've dug about 50 paces.
It's bloody hard work,
and there's a lot of clay.
I prefer the clay.
It's not like sand.
Always afraid it's gonna collapse
and bury you.
How've you been?
There's a French officer
comes out sometimes.
He stands for a few moments
on the castle rampart,
looking at us.
Then he goes back inside.
I just need one good shot.
One good shot.
Have you heard?
There are meant to be
a few women around camp.
Not many, mind. Just a few.
That's what I heard.
If you fancy the pox!
Perhaps you're right.
In any case, I have a wife back home
and she is with child.
What do you want, a boy or girl?
A boy.
I hope to God
we're not here too long.
"Although Your Majesty's absence
has not been long,
"yet the want of your presence
"means that I cannot
take pleasure in anything
"until I hear from Your Majesty."
"Time hangs heavily."
"I have a great desire to know
"how Your Majesty has done
since you left."
"For your prosperity and health,
"I prefer and desire
more than my own."
"And although I know Your Majesty's
absence is never without great need
"still, love and affection compel me
"to desire your presence."
"Thus love makes me set aside
my own convenience
"and pleasure for you,
"at whose hands I have received
so much love and goodness
"that words cannot express it."
"We hear word of ill weather
"and delays besetting you."
"And though we thank God
for your good health,
"we anxiously await the joyous news
"of the success
of your great venture
"and for your safe
and triumphant return,
"for which all England
offers daily prayers."
<i>More supports in the space!</i>
"I fear I am but a poor substitute
for Your Majesty
"in the matter of the guidance
of your kingdom."
"I long for your return."
"I commit you to God's care
and governance."
"By Your Majesty's humble,
obedient wife
"and servant, Catherine the Queen."
But, Majesty, I beg you
to give us a little more time.
The men are working
all day and all night.
But sometimes we must stop
digging to support the roof
or else everything collapses.
Master Surgeon!
Signor Treviso.
- What is it?
- Majesty,
I regret to inform you of the deaths
of ten of your soldiers.
- Soldier die of their wounds.
- No, Your Majesty.
The men all died of the bloody flux.
Dysentery?
I am afraid there is an outbreak
of the disease throughout your army.
God alone knows
how many it will take away.
Master Surgeon.
Mr. Treviso.
Let me ask you something.
What do you think of our Italian
gentleman, signor Girolamo Treviso?
The builder of tunnels.
- What do you mean?
- I mean do you trust him?
Why should I not trust him?
It's only that I happen to know
that, some time ago,
he said he could build a mirror
large enough
that if set upon the cliffs of Dover
His Majesty would be able to see,
reflected in it,
the movement of French ships
in and out of the port of Boulogne.
Do you see what I mean, Your Grace?
Do you think he's mad?
It's only a suggestion.
But then,
he's not the only one!
<i>Change the watch!</i>
<i>Section ready!</i>
<i>Pull me up!</i>
<i>Ready captain!</i>
<i>Précédemment...</i>
Nous préparons
l'invasion de la France.
La Reine Katherine sera régente
durant mon séjour à Boulogne.
En fait, je soupçonne Sa Majesté
d'être protestante
et je le prouverai un jour.
Majesté, les Français pensent
que leurs remparts les rendent
- invulnérables à notre artillerie.
- Nous verrons.
Nous pouvons conquérir l'enfer.
Feu !
Les forces de l'Empereur assiègent
la forteresse de Luxembourg
et St Didier.
Nous romprons le siège
et avancerons sur Paris.
M. Latimer, j'ai décidé
de vous nommer
mon aumônier personnel.
En êtes-vous certaine ?
Vous connaissez ma réputation.
La Reine Catherine a fait
de Hugh Latimer
- son aumônier personnel.
- Et on dit
qu'elle est intelligente.
- Pourquoi ne pas me relâcher ?
- Vous nous combattrez.
- Pour vous tuer.
- Ma prisonnière vaut une rançon.
Je veux creuser 3 tunnels.
Un ici, sous le rempart.
Nous pourrions être sous le château
pour une explosion
en trois semaines.
Deux semaines.
Que pensez-vous de M. Treviso ?
- Le constructeur de tunnels.
- Vous le croyez fou ?
Ce n'est pas le seul.
J'ai le regret de vous informer
de la mort de dix soldats.
Ils sont morts de flux sanglant.
Je crains une hécatombe
au sein de votre armée.
Dieu seul sait combien succomberont.

Feu !
Rechargez. Parez !
Seigneur !
N'avez-vous rien trouvé à manger ?
Il n'y a rien.
À des kilomètres à la ronde,
il n'y a plus
aucun mouton, vache, porc, lièvre,
rien de comestible.
Les paysans français mendient
du pain car leurs enfants
meurent de faim.
Je ne m'inquiète pas
pour leurs enfants.
Mais pour mes soldats.
Dommage que les Français
ne sortent pas nous affronter
comme avant.
Je pourrais me prendre pour
Lancelot Du Lac.
Au lieu d'être assis dans ce merdier
à mourir de faim.
Sauf les salauds qui s'enfuient !
Avancez !
Courez !
Arrêtez !
Attendez !
Ne bougez pas.
Pas le temps d'avoir peur, mes amis.
Retournez-y.
Où sommes-nous ?
À une centaine de mètres du château.
Seigneur !
Combien sont morts
du flux sanglant ?
Deux mille pour l'instant.
Et 3 000 autres sont malades
et ne combattent pas.
Les malades pompent
nos ressources limitées.
Selon moi,
on devrait les séparer des valides
et les renvoyer en Angleterre.
Et retirer des bateaux du blocus !
Quelle est la cause de ce flux sanglant
qui nous handicape ?
Votre Majesté,
personne n'est d'accord.
C'est le manque de ravitaillement.
Ou, au contraire,
c'est la gourmandise,
Ils se sont gavés de fruits verts
et de fruits de mer en arrivant.
Ce qui est certain,
c'est qu'on ne sait pas
comment arrêter la propagation.
Si le siège devait durer,
une grande partie de l'armée
serait bientôt
enterrée autour de Boulogne.
Je n'en entendrai pas plus !
Vous êtes mon ennemi
autant que les Français,
puisque vous démoralisez,
mentez sur nos faiblesses
et répandez des rumeurs de maladie.
Ces hommes ne sont pas malades,
ils sont lâches.
Et je ne les renverrai pas chez eux.
Ils se battront ou je les pendrai.
Allez les tirer de leur lit,
remettez-les à leur poste
ou je vous raccourcis d'une tête.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Et à l'avenir, soyez franc.
Peut-être que les initiales
de ces noms...
L'évêque Gardiner demande audience.
Faites-le entrer.
Venez, mesdames.
- Votre Grâce.
- Votre Majesté.
Avez-vous des nouvelles récentes
du Roi
et de ses affaires ?
Le Roi va bien.
Il est dans le meilleur état d'esprit.
Il n'a jamais été plus heureux.
Nous prions tous pour sa vie
et son succès.
Je voudrais discuter
d'un sujet avec Votre Majesté,
puisque vous êtes régente
en son absence.
J'écoute.
Après avoir découvert et détruit
un nid d'hérétiques
chez les musiciens du Roi,
nous avons découvert qu'il y en a même
dans les appartements privés du Roi.
De qui parlez-vous, My Lord ?
Le barbier et le cuisinier du Roi.
Nous avons des preuves pour établir
la mise en accusation.
Nous avons juste besoin
de votre signature.
My Lord,
je vous félicite de votre diligence.
Mais il n'est pas convenable
d'arrêter des hommes
si proches du Roi
sans lui en parler.
Il y a autre chose.
Il y a des rumeurs de peste
près de Windsor.
J'ai donc décidé
que le Prince Edward
viendrait à la cour.
Si vous voulez.
Vous, bougez-vous !
Sergent, par ici !
Allez, les gars !
Vous tous, allons-y.
Bougez-le.
Allumez les feux.
En échange de votre coopération,
j'autorise votre père à s'échapper.
Ma coopération ?
Promettez de ne pas vous enfuir.
Mon père accepte.
Merci.
Il doit partir.
Relâchez-le hors du camp.
Tous ensemble.
Allez, levez-vous.
- Et pour l'eau ?
- Feu !
Comment ça va, Harry ?
Bien.
Voilà...
Voilà à manger.
- C'est à toi.
- Tu en as plus besoin que moi.
Je m'assois et regarde les mouettes.
Allez, prends-le.
Mange.
Et les chevaux,
ils sont magnifiques.
Je vous souhaite la bienvenue,
Lord Hertford.
Votre visite confirme votre confiance
dans la régence de la Reine.
Majesté,
je n'ai entendu que des compliments
sur son dévouement
et son don pour gérer le royaume.
Elle a un esprit brillant
et la touche d'une femme
qui apaise et soigne,
quand un homme serait colérique
et se plaindrait.
- Et mon fils ?
- Le Prince Edward va bien.
- Un toast à sa santé.
- Au Prince.
Quoi ?
Votre Majesté,
j'ai appris que l'Empereur
s'est emparé
des deux forteresses
qu'il assiégeait
et a capturé 15 000 hommes.
Que vous avais-je dit ?
Je n'ai jamais cru à vos méthodes.
C'était trop long.
Vous ne savez pas
commander des soldats.
J'aurais pu vous le dire.
Les sièges ennuient les hommes
et les rendent paresseux.
Ils s'adoucissent.
Pas vrai, Votre Grâce ?
- Les hommes s'adoucissent.
- C'est vrai,
le camp grouille de prostituées.
Mais vu les conditions...
Je veux m'assurer du comportement
des troupes en cas d'attaque.
Nous ferons exploser une charge
sous le château
sans prévenir.
Nous verrons ainsi la réaction
lors d'une crise impromptue.
Majesté, écoutez-moi, je vous prie.
Dans quelques jours,
nous serons sous le château.
Pour l'amour de Dieu.
Tant, de vies perdues
et pour quoi ?
Majesté, accordez-moi deux jours.
C'est votre nourriture, non ?
Qu'en est-il des habitants de la ville ?
Que mangent-ils ?
Leurs chats.
S'ils ont des chats.
Pourquoi avoir relâché mon père ?
Je l'ai interrogé.
Il n'a rien dit d'utile
sur les défenses de la ville.
Et moi oui ?
Pourquoi me garder ici ?
Ces mousquets sont prêts ?
Lady Mary.
Je voulais vous montrer ma traduction
de l'Évangile de St Jean par Érasme.
Je viens de commencer.
Mais il vous est dédié.
Car je sais à quel point
notre foi vous importe.
Merci Lady Mary.
Je suis très émue.
Venez !
C'est si agréable pour moi
d'être avec vous trois.
Ça devrait être comme ça !
Edward ! Je vais t'attraper !
Prince Edward !
Un peu de tenue !
- Edward !
- Venez ici, votre Grâce.
Dites-moi,
vous aimez Lady Bryan, non ?
Je crois qu'elle vous aime aussi.
Mais je crois qu'il est temps
que vous soyez séparé
de Lady Bryan et ses nourrices.
Vous êtes assez âgé
pour être placé avec vos tuteurs.
Je suppose que oui.
Pas d'inquiétude.
Il y aura d'autres garçons.
Il y aura Henry,
le fils du Duc de Suffolk.
Ça ne se limitera pas à l'étude
des langues et de la Bible.
Il y aura aussi le tennis
et l'escrime,
la musique, la danse.
Ce sera drôle, non ?
Bonne nuit, Prince.
Merci Lady Bryan.
- Bonne nuit, Majesté.
- Bonne nuit.
- Bonne nuit, Majesté.
- Bonne nuit, Lady Mary.
Venez, que je vous embrasse.
J'attends beaucoup de vous
et je ne serai pas déçue.
J'espère que non.
Maintenant au lit ma petite.
Un moment, Maîtresse Ashley.
Anne.
Je vous crois digne de confiance.
Je crois que votre famille
est attachée à la Réforme.
Anne Boleyn,
la mère de Lady Elizabeth
était aussi une luthérienne.
Je suppose donc
qu'il est de mon devoir d'élever
la fille dans la foi de la mère.
Vous avez des objections ?
Non, Majesté.
Je serai fière de l'aider à honorer
ainsi la mémoire de sa mère,
dont la vie et la foi
sont si souvent critiquées.
Bien.
Je vais donc nommer
Roger Ascham comme tuteur.
Il est aussi des nôtres.
Maîtresse Ashley,
cette conversation n'a pas eu lieu.
Bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit Majesté.
- Quoi ?
- J'ai brisé ma promesse.
J'ai fui.
Mais je suis revenue.
Vous avez du sang sur la tête.
Merci,
à vous tous.
Ce fut un honneur et un privilège
de travailler
avec des hommes comme vous.
Que Dieu soit avec vous.
<i>Grazie.</i> Dieu vous bénisse, Monsieur.
<i>Grazie mille.</i>
Allez.
Faites place !
Place au canon !
Allez, Girolamo, allez.
Allez !
Courez !
Il m'a menti !
C'est un charlatan !
Girolamo est encore fou !
Allez !
Courez !
Non !
- Girolamo !
- Sauvez-vous !
Par ici !
Ils sont blessés dans la mine !
On a trouvé quelqu'un !
Sortez-le, vite !
Allez-y ! Allez-y !
Pour l'Angleterre !
Le mur est tombé !
Victoire !
Il y en a d'autres ?
Il y en a d'autres ?
- D'autres survivants à l'intérieur ?
- Non.
Pour l'Angleterre !
<i>Chefs de section, en formation !</i>
<i>Rassemblez-vous !</i>
<i>Préparez-vous à prendre la ville !</i>
<i>En avant !</i>
Oui.
Les enfants ! Lady Mary !
De grandes nouvelles de France !
Le Roi a pris Boulogne.
Il est sauf et triomphant.
Votre père est un héros !
Il a pris Boulogne !
Je suis sûre qu'il rentrera bientôt.
Merveilleux.
Mon Prince victorieux,
en tant que gouverneur de Boulogne,
je ne peux que céder
les clefs de la ville.
Monsieur.
J'espère que vous laisserez
les habitants
et la garnison désarmée partir
sans être inquiétés.
Je le jure solennellement.
Bien que vous m'ayez,
contre la volonté divine
et en dépit de toute justice
privé d'une ville qui,
de par mon noble héritage
m'appartient.
Je félicite Sa Majesté.
Vous avez conquis une des plus
belles villes de France.
Dans leur grand besoin,
beaucoup ont mangé du cheval.
Vous les avez vus partir ?
Même les prêtres sont maigres !
Alors, Lord Hertford,
était-ce bien une réussite ?
N'était-ce pas la volonté divine
de nous rendre
une partie de notre héritage ?
La capture de Boulogne retentira
à jamais dans le cœur des Anglais,
et Henry VIII, comme Henry V, vivra
dans les glorieuses annales
de notre royaume.
J'appelle Boulogne "notre fille".
Et je suis
le "Haut Roi de Boulogne" !
Un toast ! À vous tous.
À nous tous !
À la victoire.
À la victoire !
Votre Grâce, je dois vous remercier.
Vous vous êtes distingué
lors de cette campagne.
Je vous suis reconnaissant.
Je suppose
que nous marchons vers Paris ?
D'où vous vient cette idée ?
Pardon, je ne comprends pas.
Je pensais que c'était le but
du pacte avec l'Empereur.
Vous voulez marcher sur Paris
avec la moitié d'une armée,
des milliers de soldats malades,
en plein hiver ?
Non, Votre Grâce.
À l'instant, Boulogne m'importe
bien plus que Paris,
que dix Paris !
Nous retournons en Angleterre.
Nous avons remporté
une grande victoire.
Et je tiens à la conserver.
Je laisse Surrey
en charge de la ville.
- Surrey ?
- Oui.
C'est un problème ?
Désolé.
Suis-je libre ?
Vous êtes libre.
Vous n'avez pas demandé de rançon ?
Vous pensez donc
que je n'ai aucune valeur ?
Vous...
n'avez pas de prix.
Partez avec moi.
- Où ?
- En Angleterre.
Pour être votre maîtresse,
votre catin française ?
Non.
Quoi d'autre ?
My Lady.
Votre Majesté,
je suis si heureuse
de vous voir bien portant
et satisfait.
Et sain et sauf, grâce à Dieu !
Et victorieux, grâce à Dieu !
Et victorieux.
Malgré ces festivités,
la situation actuelle
m'inquiète beaucoup.
L'entreprise du Roi
a ruiné nos finances.
Est-ce que je me trompe ?
Nous ne savons plus qu'inventer
pour parvenir à payer la campagne.
Ni même comment faire face
aux prochains mois.
Nous sommes en guerre
avec la France et l'Écosse.
L'évêque de Rome nous est hostile.
Nous ne sommes plus assurés
de l'amitié de l'Empereur.
Cette guerre s'est avérée néfaste
pour le royaume
et désastreuse pour le commerce.
Messieurs, que Dieu nous garde,
nous vivons dans un monde où...
la raison et le savoir
ne triomphent plus,
où l'on fait fi de ses engagements.
Où il semble que même la reine
soit une hérétique.
C'est vrai.
Sa chute devra être l'œuvre de Dieu.
Votre Excellence.
Votre Grâce.
Vos Majestés,
je dois vous informer,
qu'au vu de mon infirmité,
j'ai demandé mon retour en Espagne.
J'attends à présent
la permission de l'Empereur.
Je voudrais en profiter
pour vous remercier,
au nom de Sa Majesté l'Empereur,
pour ce que vous avez fait
en faveur de Lady Mary
et pour avoir encouragé l'amitié
entre l'Angleterre et l'Espagne.
Excellence, j'aimerais pouvoir
faire beaucoup plus pour Lady Mary,
car c'est mon devoir
à tout point de vue.
En ce qui concerne
l'amitié entre nos pays,
je ne ferai jamais rien
qui puisse l'empêcher
de se développer,
car cette amitié est nécessaire
et nos deux souverains
sont si généreux.
Tout comme vous, My Lady.
Excellence.
Majesté.
J'ai appris que votre maître a signé
un autre traité avec la France.
Est-ce vrai ?
Je vous demande si c'est vrai.
Ma question est-elle si compliquée ?
Oui. C'est vrai, Majesté.
Pourquoi faire cela ?
Nous étions supposés être alliés.
Je crois que Sa Majesté
n'avait pas le choix.
Le siège de la ville de Luxembourg
a été trop long.
- La maladie a décimé son armée.
- Il n'aurait pas dû !
Derrière mon dos !
Je lui faisais confiance
et il m'a trahi.
Vous l'avez défendu toute votre vie.
On ne peut se fier à lui.
Vous devriez être soulagé
de ne plus avoir à mentir pour lui.
Vous avez ma permission
de quitter ma cour.
Je vous souhaite une longue
et heureuse retraite, Excellence.
Votre Majesté.
Adieu, Excellence.
Elle est plus grande que moi, non ?
Un peu.
Comment...
la décririez-vous ?
Je la décrirais comme ma femme.
Quand la verrai-je ?
Vous voulez la voir ?
Mais votre fils, Henry...
Oui.
Un jour.
À quoi pensez-vous ?
J'étais mort
et je vis à nouveau.
Je veux vous regarder.
Parlez-moi.
Les mots sont sans importance.
Ne partez pas.
Je l'interdis.
J'y suis obligé.
Vous voyez l'état
dans lequel je suis.
Pensez-vous à moi ?
Je n'aurais pu vous laisser
entre de meilleures mains
que celles de la Reine.
Je pense qu'elle vous aime.
C'est possible.
Je ne sais pas.
Je sais
qu'elle ne partage pas notre foi.
Elle prétend être catholique,
mais c'est faux.
C'est une hérétique
et vous voulez que je la laisse agir !
Ce n'est pas votre faute.
C'est la mienne.
Si j'avais été un homme,
ça ne serait pas arrivé.
L'Angleterre
aurait encore ses fidèles.
Princesse ! Je vous en prie.
J'ai grandi
depuis notre première rencontre,
en discernement.
J'ignore si je me marierai,
ou si je deviendrai Reine.
Probablement pas.
Mais si je deviens Reine,
je jure sur les Saints Évangiles
et sur l'âme de ma mère,
que je ramènerai la foi
en Angleterre.
À cette fin,
je brûlerai autant d'hérétiques
que je le devrai,
je verserai le sang nécessaire,
pour que ce malheureux royaume
redevienne catholique,
et je le soignerai,
avec l'aide de Dieu.
Puis-je ?
Prenez cette bague,
en souvenir de moi.
C'était un cadeau de l'Empereur.
Il l'avait reçu de votre mère.
Votre Majesté,
nous avons reçu des nouvelles.
Bien qu'un le traité de paix
ait été conclu par la France à Crécy,
l'Empereur a autorisé le mariage
entre sa fille et le Duc d'Orléans.
Très bien.
Il y a d'autres nouvelles.
Nous savons que le Dauphin
et une armée
de plus de 36 000 hommes,
s'apprêtent à marcher sur Boulogne.
Je veux que ma victoire
soit fêtée partout en Angleterre.
C'est un évènement glorieux,
après tout.
Faites
que toutes les cloches sonnent
et qu'une messe de grâce
soit dite dans chaque église.
Je veux que le nom de "Boulogne"
soit dans tous les cœurs anglais,
tout comme Azincourt !
Oui, Votre Majesté.
<i>Previously on The Tudors</i>
We will now proceed with our plans
for an invasion of France.
While I'm in Boulogne,
Queen Katherine will act as regent.
Indeed, I suspect Her Majesty
of being a secret Protestant
and I intend one day to prove it.
Majesty, the French consider
their strong ramparts and double walls
- invulnerable to our artillery!
- We shall see.
We've enough cannon to conquer hell.
Fire!
The Emperor's forces
are at present besieging
the fortresses of Luxembourg
and St. Didier.
We'll break our siege first
then advance on Paris.
Mr. Latimer, I have a mind
to appoint you chaplain
to my household.
Are you absolutely sure?
You must know my reputation.
Queen Catherine has
appointed Hugh Latimer
- as her private Chaplain.
- And I thought someone said
she was an intelligent woman.
- Why won't you release me?
- You'll fight against us.
- I'll kill you.
- You're my prisoner.
I'll even get a ransom for you.
I intend to dig three tunnels.
One here, at the town wall.
We could be under the castle
and detonate
a huge explosion in three weeks.
Two weeks.
What do you think of Senor Treviso?
- The builder of tunnels.
- Do you think he's mad?
He's not the only one.
I regret to inform you of the deaths
of ten of your Majesty's soldiers.
They all died of the bloody flux.
There is an outbreak of the disease
throughout your army.
God alone knows
how many it will take away.

There's nothing to find.
The whole countryside for miles
and miles is stripped
of every sheep, cow, pig,
hare, of anything edible.
French peasants came up to us,
for a piece of bread because children
are dying for want of food.
It's not their little
ones I worry about.
It's my own soldiers.
It's a pity the French'll not come out
and break lances with us,
as they used to do.
Then I could truly fancy I was
Lancelot Du Lac.
Instead of sitting here
in our own shit
and starving to death!
Except for the bastards
who try and run away!
Forward!
Reload!
Run! Run!
Stop! Stop!
Wait!
Don't move.
<i>Dai! Tornianno a lavorare.</i>
We do not have time
to be afraid, my friends.
Go, back to work.
Do you know where we are?
The castle's still
three hundred feet away.
Christ!
How many men have died of the flux?
- So far?
- Two thousand.
And a further three thousand
are sick with it and not fit to fight.
The sick are using
up our limited resources.
In my opinion, they should be
separated from the well
and transported back to England.
I would have to that several ships
from my blockade!
What's the cause of this bloody flux
that so unmans us?
Your Majesty, there is much
disagreement as to causes.
Some say it is the result
of lack of supplies.
Others, by contrast,
say it comes of greed,
they have gorged
themselves on unripe fruit
and shellfish when
they first arrived.
What is certain is that there
is no way known to man
to stop its spreading infection.
If the siege should continue
for much longer,
A great portion
of Your Majesty's army will soon
be dug into the fields of Boulogne.
I will not hear anymore about it!
You are as much my enemy
as the French,
since you seek to demoralize,
to lie about our weaknesses,
and to spin tales of sickness.
These men are not sick
from the flux but from cowardice!
And I will not send cowards home!
They will either fight
or I will hang them by the wayside.
You! Get them from their sickbeds
back into that trench,
or I will make you a head shorter.
Yes, your Majesty.
And in the future tell me the truth!
Perhaps the initials
of these names...
Bishop Gardiner
asks for an audience.
Send him in.
Come, ladies.
- Your Grace.
- Your Majesty.
I have come to hear if there
is any fresh news of the King
and his affairs?
The King is very well
and in the best of spirits.
He has never seemed happier.
We all pray for the King's life
and his success.
There is one matter
I should discuss with your Majesty,
since you act as Regent
in his absence.
Go on.
Having discovered a nest of heretics
among the King's musicians
and destroyed it,
we discover that there are heretics
even in the King's privy chambers.
Of whom do you speak, My Lord?
The King's barber
and the royal cook.
We have evidence to draw up...
this draft indictment.
All that we require
is your signature.
My Lord, I praise you
for your diligence in these matters.
But I do not think it proper
to arrest men
so close to the King's
person-without first asking him.
There is one other matter.
We have heard rumors
of an outbreak of plague near Windsor.
So I have decided to invite
the Prince Edward
to come here to court
and stay with me.
As you wish.
You! Move yourself!
Sergeant, over here!
Right, men!
All you boys, let's have you now.
Move it, move it!
Raise the light, boys!
In return for your cooperation,
I allow your father to escape.
My cooperation?
You must promise not to try
and escape yourself.
My father agrees.
Thank you.
He must go now.
Release him outside the camp.
Together now!
Come on, up on your feet!
- What about water?
- Fire!
How are things, Harry?
Good.
Here...
Here's some food.
- That's your food.
- You need it more than I do.
I just sit outside
and watch the seagulls.
Go on, take it!
Eat it.
And the horses!
The horse is magnificent.
I bid you most welcome,
My Lord Hertford.
Your visit here confirms
your confidence in the Queen's Regency!
Majesty, I have heard
nothing but praise
in all quarters for her dedication
and skill in matters of state.
She has great clarity of mind,
and a woman's touch
which soothes and cures
where a man would usually
rush into anger and complaint.
- And the boy?
- Prince Edward is well and healthy.
- A toast to his health!
- To the Prince.
What is it?
Your Majesty,
I have received word that
the Emperor has seized
both the fortresses
he was besieging,
and has taken fifteen
hundred enemy prisoners.
What did I tell you?
I never trusted your methods.
Everything has taken too long.
You don't know
how to handle the soldiers!
I swear to God
I could have told you.
Siege warfare makes
men idle and bored.
They get soft.
Isn't that right, Your Grace?
- The men get soft.
- It's true,
The camp is swarming with prostitutes.
But considering the conditions...
I want to make sure of the troops'
good behaviour in case of an assault.
We shall explode one of the charges
under the castle walls prematurely
without warning.
We can observe the temper
of the troops in a sudden crisis.
Majesty, please.
Listen to me, I beg you!
We are only days away
from mining under the castle...
For the love of God, please.
So many, many lives lost
and for what?
Majesty, give me two days.
This is your food. Isn't it?
What about the people in the town?
What are they eating?
Their cats.
If they have cats.
Why did you let my father go?
I questioned him.
He couldn't tell me anything
useful about the town's defenses.
And I can?
Why are you keeping me here?
Are those muskets prepared?
Lady Mary.
I wanted to show you my translation
of Erasmus's "Gospel of St. John."
It is only started.
But it is dedicated to you...
Since I know how much
our faith matters to you.
Thank you, Lady Mary.
I am deeply touched.
Come!
This is so nice for me
To be
with all three of you together.
Which I think is as it should be!
Edward! I'll catch you!
Prince Edward!
A little decorum, please!
- Edward!
- Come here, your Grace.
Now, tell me,
you love the Lady Bryan, don't you?
I think she loves you too
But I think that it is time
you were breeched
from the Lady Bryan and her nurses.
You are old enough to be placed
with your tutors, don't you think?
I suppose so.
Don't worry.
There'll be other boys too.
There'll be
the Duke of Suffolk's son Henry.
It won't be all learning languages
and scriptures.
You'll also learn tennis
and fencing,
music and dance.
That will be fun, won't it?
Good night, Prince.
Lady Bryan, thank you.
- Good night, your Majesty.
- Good night.
- Good night, your Majesty.
- Good night, Lady Mary.
Come here. Let me hug you.
I expect great things of you,
and I shall not be disappointed.
I hope not.
Now off to bed, sweet girl.
Mistress Ashley, a moment.
Anne.
I believe that I can trust you.
I think that your family
are reformers.
Yes.
Lady Elizabeth's mother,
Anne Boleyn, was also
a Lutheran and a reformer.
I suppose it is my duty,
therefore, to bring
the daughter
up in the mother's faith.
Would you have
any objection to that?
None, your Majesty.
I should be proud to help her
thus honor the memory of her mother,
whose life-and whose faith...
Too many so easily disparage.
Good.
Then I will appoint
as her tutor Roger Ascham.
He is also one of us.
Mistress Ashley,
this conversation never happened.
Good night.
Good night, Your Majesty.
- What?
- I broke my promise.
I escaped.
But I came back.
You've got blood on your head.
Thank you,
all of you.
It has been an honor and a privilege
to have worked
alongside men such as you.
<i>Grazie.</i>
God be with you.
<i>Grazie.</i> God bless you, sir.
<i>Grazie mille.</i>
Go.
Clear the way!
Move for the cannon!
Come on Girolamo, come on.
Go!
Run!
Run!
He lied to me!
He's a charlatan!
Girolamo's mad again!
Go!
Run!
No!
- Girolamo!
- Save yourself!
Get in here!
They're injured in the mine!
We found somebody!
Quickly, get him out!
Go on! Go on, sir!
England!
The wall is down!
Victory!
Is there anyone else?
Are there any others?
- Is there anyone else alive in there?
- No.
England!
<i>Section Commanders, form up!</i>
<i>Form up your men!</i>
<i>Prepare to take the city!</i>
<i>Forward!</i>
Yes.
Children! Lady Mary!
There is great news from France!
The king has taken Boulogne.
He is safe and triumphant.
Your father is a hero!
He has captured Boulogne!
I'm certain he'll be home very soon.
How wonderful.
Most victorious Prince,
as Governor of Boulogne,
I have no choice but to surrender
the keys of the town.
Monsieur.
I trust your Majesty will allow
the inhabitants of the town
and its unarmed garrison to leave
unmolested and in safety.
I do so swear, on my honor.
Although you and your company,
despite God's will,
and contrary to all justice,
withheld from me a town which,
being a noble part of my inheritance,
belonged to me.
Well, I congratulate your Majesty.
You have captured one of the most
beautiful town in France.
In their great necessity,
many of them ate horseflesh.
Did you see them go out?
Even the priests were thin!
So, my Lord Hertford,
was it well done or not?
Was it not God's will
that we should reclaim
part of our just rights
and inheritance?
The capture of Boulogne will live
forever in the hearts of all Englishmen,
ad the eighth Henry
as well as the fifth,
in the glorious annals of our realm.
I call Boulogne "our daughter."
And I am the "King's Highness
of Boulogne!"
Hertford.
Majesty.
A toast! To all.
To all!
And to victory.
And to victory!
Your Majesty.
Your Grace.
Your Grace, I have much
to thank you for.
You have distinguished yourself
above all in this campaign.
I am grateful to your Majesty.
And now, I assume,
we are march on Paris?
Why would you assume that?
Forgive me, I don't understand.
I thought that was the purpose
of the pact with the Emperor.
Do you suppose we should march
on Paris with half an army,
with thousands of sick soldiers,
and in winter?
No, your Grace,
right now, Boulogne is now far
more important to me than Paris,
than ten Parises!
No, we shall back to England.
We have gained
here a singular victory.
And I mean to hold onto it.
I shall leave Surrey
in command of the town.
- Surrey?
- Yes.
Is that a problem, your Grace?
No, your Majesty.
Your Grace.
I'm sorry.
Am I free to go?
Yes.
You're free to go.
You didn't ask for a ransom?
No.
Then, do you think
I'm not worth anything?
You...
are worth everything.
Come back with me.
Where?
To England.
As your mistress, your French whore?
No.
Then what?
<i>Je t'aime</i>
<i>Je t'aime. C'est tout.</i>
My Lady.
Your Majesty,
it makes me so glad
to see you so well and happy.
And returned safe, thank God.
And victorious, thank God!
And victorious.
Bishop.
Gentlemen, for all this celebration,
I am very worried
about our state of affairs.
The King's enterprise
has bankrupted our exchequer.
Is that not correct, Sir Richard?
We're at our wit's end to know how
to get revenues to pay for the campaign,
or even shift for the next
two or three months.
We are at war with France
and with Scotland.
We have the enmity
of the bishop of Rome.
We no longer have assurances
of friendship with the Emperor.
This war has proved
noisome to the realm
and disastrous for our merchants.
Gentlemen, God help us,
we live in a world where...
reason and learning
no longer prevail
and covenants are little regarded.
And where it seems
even our Queen is a heretic.
It's true.
And it will be God's work
to destroy her.
Your Excellency.
Your Grace.
Your Majesties,
you should know that,
due to my infirmity,
I have applied for a recall to Spain
and am even now am awaiting
the Emperor's permission.
Madam,
I would like to take this opportunity
to thank you,
on behalf of his Majesty
the Emperor,
for all that you have done
for the Lady Mary
and for fostering the friendship
between England and Spain.
Excellency, what I have done
for the Lady Mary
is much less than
I would like to do,
as well as being my duty
in every respect.
And as for the friendship
between our two countries,
I have done and will do nothing
to prevent it
from growing still further,
as the friendship is so necessary
and both sovereigns...
so good.
As are you, my Lady.
Excellency!
Majesty.
I hear your Master has signed
a separate treaty with the French.
Is it true?
I asked you if it was true!
Is it so hard a question, Eustace?
Yes, it's true, your Majesty.
And why should he do that?
We were supposed to be allies.
I believe his Majesty had no choice.
He had spent too long besieging
the town of Luxembourg;
His army was riddled with disease.
He still should not have done it!
Behind my back!
I trusted him and he betrayed me.
Your...
You defended and excused
him your whole life!
He is not to be trusted...
And you should be relieved that you
no longer have to lie on his behalf.
You have my permission
to leave my court.
I wish you a long and happy
retirement, your Excellency.
Your Majesty.
Farewell, your Excellency.
She is taller than me, isn't she?
A little.
How would you describe her?
I would describe her as my wife.
When shall I meet her?
Do you want to meet her?
But your son Henry?
Yes, sometime.
What are you thinking?
That I was dead,
and am alive again.
Let me look at you.
Say something.
Words aren't important.
You mustn't go.
I forbid it.
My Lady, I have to.
You can see how it is with me.
And what about me?
Madam, I don't think I could have
ever left you in better care
than Queen Catherine.
I believe she loves you.
She may love me.
I don't know.
What I do know is
that she is not of our faith.
She pretends,
but she is not a Catholic.
She is a heretic and still
you leave me in her care!
Madam...
No, it is not your fault.
It is my fault.
If I had been a boy and not a girl,
none of this would have ever happened.
And England would still be faithful.
Princess! I beg you.
I am a lot older than I was
when I first knew you.
And wiser.
I do not know
if I shall ever be married,
or if I will ever be Queen.
Probably neither.
But if I do become Queen,
I swear to you now
on the Holy Gospels
and on the soul of my mother,
that I will make England
faithful again.
I will do whatever it takes,
I will burn however many
heretics I have to,
I will spill as much blood
as I have to,
to make this unfortunate realm
Catholic again,
and heal it, so help me God.
May I?
Take this ring,
in memory of me.
It was a gift from the Emperor...
Who received it from your mother.
Your Majesty,
we have received news that,
as well as concluding his separate
peace treaty with the French at Crecy,
the Emperor has given permission
for a marriage between his daughter
and the Duke of Orleans.
All right.
There is further news.
We understand that the Dauphin
and an army of over 36,000 men
are preparing to march on Boulogne.
I want my victory to be celebrated
in every house in England.
It was, after all,
a very glorious affair.
I want you to arrange
for every bell to be rung
and a mass of Thanksgiving
to be said in every church.
I want the name "Boulogne"
imprinted on every English heart...
just like Agincourt!
Yes, your Majesty.
<i>Précédemment...</i>
Je félicite Sa Majesté.
Vous avez conquis
l'une des plus belles villes.
Nous avons remporté une grande victoire.
Je tiens à la conserver.
Je laisse Surrey en charge.
- Surrey ?
- Oui. C'est un problème ?
Ces hommes de vile naissance,
anoblis par le Roi,
ont été la risée
de la noblesse de ce royaume.
Si Dieu rappelle le Roi à lui,
ils en paieront le prix.
Donnez une leçon d'humilité au duc.
Pouvez-vous
le faire tomber en disgrâce ?
Votre maître a signé
un traité avec la France.
Je le croyais.
Vous devez être soulagé
de ne plus avoir à mentir pour lui.
Ma sœur, vous savez
que je ne voulais pas épouser le Roi.
Je peux au moins utiliser
mon influence
pour une cause en laquelle je crois.
C'est une hérétique
et elle s'occupe de moi.
Je brûlerai autant d'hérétiques
que je le devrai,
l'Angleterre redeviendra catholique.
Les initiatives du Roi
ont ruiné le Trésor.
Nous n'avons pas les moyens
de payer la campagne de Boulogne.
Cette guerre est désastreuse
pour le royaume.
Même la Reine est hérétique.
Et ce sera l'œuvre de Dieu
de la détruire.
Je veux que ma victoire
soit fêtée partout en Angleterre.
Je veux que Boulogne soit
dans tous les cœurs anglais.

Majesté.
Les prêtres ne se marieront pas.
Votre Majesté.
Lord Hertford demande audience.
Hertford.
Nous avons des nouvelles de France.
Surrey a imprudemment attaqué
les Français à Saint-Etienne,
à côté de Boulogne,
il a perdu plus de 600 hommes
et les capitaines
et les gentilshommes
qu'il avait placés
en première ligne.
My Lords, j'ai entendu parler
des évènements désastreux
de Boulogne.
On dit que Lord Surrey
a affronté un convoi de Français
et a été totalement défait.
Les capitaines sont morts,
ainsi que la plupart des nobles.
Et tout ceci,
malgré mes appels à la prudence
et à protéger Boulogne.
En conséquence,
je lui ai ordonné de revenir,
pour que vous jugiez sa conduite.
En attendant,
vous le remplacerez, Lord Hertford.
Partez de suite pour Boulogne.
Pour son travail et son talent,
je nomme mon secrétaire,
M. Risley, Lord Chancellor,
et lui accorde le titre de baron.
Je suis touché
et très honoré de votre confiance.
- Lord Suffolk ?
- Majesté,
des rumeurs disent que les Français
arment une grande flotte.
L'Empereur aurait ordonné
de saisir les navires et les propriétés
des Anglais aux Pays-Bas.
Comment y répondre ?
Mon Dieu.
Quand je pense
à ma fidélité envers mes amis
et à toutes leurs trahisons...
Une flotte rassemblée...
- Lord Hertford.
- Excellence.
Pouvons-nous parler, en privé ?
Alors ?
Beaucoup de choses ne vont pas
au royaume de Sa Majesté.
Lesquelles ?
Les mauvaises récoltes
et les dettes.
L'épidémie chez les marins de la flotte
de Sa Majesté
leurs têtes enflées
et leurs bateaux pourris.
Excellence,
où voulez-vous en venir ?
L'empoisonnement et la pauvreté
du royaume du Roi
sont dûs à l'occupation
imprudente et intenable
de Boulogne...
Si vous le dites.
C'est vrai
que j'étais contre la guerre.
Mais on ne m'a pas écouté.
On ne vous a pas écouté,
vous le serez pour la paix.
Persuadez le Roi
que c'est la folie
de s'accrocher à Boulogne,
contre tout bon sens.
Nous pourrions conclure un accord.
- My Lord.
- M. Risley, Votre Grâce.
Je dois vous féliciter.
Merci, Votre Grâce.
Je l'avoue,
cette ascension
dépasse mon imagination.
Mais imaginez-la,
et soyez content, comme nous.
Car cela signifie
que notre cause avance,
et que Sa Majesté est plus favorable
aux orthodoxes aux catholiques
et contre la Réforme.
Votre Grâce a raison.
Cependant, de mon côté,
je trouve le Roi si changeant
que je me demande s'il a sa tête.
Père !
Venez là.
C'est bon de vous revoir à la Cour.
Vous me manquiez.
- Vous rappelez-vous Brigitte ?
- Bien sûr.
Ravie de vous revoir.
Mlle Roussello
est ma maîtresse officielle.
Désolé que sa présence à la Cour
rende votre mère
malheureuse.
Mais il n'y a rien à faire,
car votre mère
m'a longtemps rendu malheureux.
- Pauvre Henry.
- Il a l'âge de savoir la vérité.
Et les choses de l'amour.
Mademoiselle,
si mon père est heureux, moi aussi.
Vous voyez ?
Il est mûr pour son âge.
- Comme vous.
- Bien.
Buvons.
- Comment allez-vous ?
- Je vais vous dire, Kate.
J'allais dix fois mieux en France
que depuis deux ans.
Je déteste par-dessus tout
les interprétations.
Peu importe
à qui je parle à la Cour.
Ambassadeurs,
ecclésiastiques,
courtisans...
Ils déforment
les faits à leur convenance.
Dieu sait que j'ai toujours été
franc et honnête.
Mais je serais fourbe,
hypocrite et malhonnête.
Votre Majesté, j'ai écrit un livre.
Puis-je vous le montrer ?
Un livre ?
De quel genre ?
Ça s'appelle
<i>Lamentations d'un pécheur</i>.
Majesté.
Lisez la dédicace.
"À la gloire de mon souverain
et mari
"le Roi Henry VIII,
"non seulement pieux et savant,
"mais aussi notre Moïse,
"car il nous a délivré
du joug du pharaon."
Rome.
Vous appelez populace
le clergé du pape,
qu'il a placé sous sa tyrannie.
"Et une éternelle gratitude
à mon Seigneur et mari,
"qui m'a montré par son œuvre
un chemin sacré,
"et m'a délivrée
de l'ignorance de ma foi aveugle."
- Vous le pensez ?
- Oui, Votre Majesté.
Et pas que pour moi.
Pour tous vos sujets aussi.
Votre Majesté.
L'évêque Gardner est ici.
Je demande la permission
d'arrêter et interroger
une hérétique
et protestante connue, Anne Askew,
craignant qu'elle n'ait
des amis,
ici, à la Cour.
Je vous y autorise, Votre Grâce.
Bon peuple anglais.
On nous dit
que nous n'avons pas
à lire la parole
de notre Seigneur.
Je préférerais lire
cinq lignes de la Bible
qu'écouter cinq messes au temple.
Le prêtre prétend changer
le vin en sang de Dieu
et le pain en corps de Dieu.
Mais où en est la preuve ?
Allez chercher
la preuve vous-mêmes.
Laissez du pain trois mois
dans une boîte,
il va moisir,
et ne changera en rien de bon.
- Place !
- Et donc, je suis convaincue
que ce n'est pas Dieu.
- Arrêtez cette femme.
- La foi
me protège.
Je me réjouis du fond du cœur,
et l'espoir me commande de le faire,
car Tu prendras mon parti
et apaiseras mon malheur.
Pour cela, tu blesses ma joie.
Sans visage, Seigneur,
ceux qui voient...
My Lord Surrey,
nous avons appris
que votre défaite à Saint-Étienne
n'était pas, comme vous l'avez dit,
due à la réticence de vos soldats,
mais à votre folie.
Et à vos gestes de bravoure
déraisonnables.
- Qu'en dites-vous ?
- Que ce n'était pas
une défaite.
Il y a eu des pertes
et des victoires des deux côtés,
et en fait,
l'ennemi a subi plus de pertes
que nous.
Cependant,
nos pertes ont été plus pénibles,
nous avons perdu nos capitaines
qui, indépendamment du danger,
- étaient en première ligne.
- Vous n'avez jamais combattu.
Ces officiers voulaient être
en première ligne.
Ils ont chargé en hurlant,
avec courage
et en commandant,
comme on était en droit de l'attendre.
Ils étaient dépassés,
mais ont brisé les lignes ennemies.
Ils ont détruit
quatre-cinquièmes du convoi.
Le désordre régnait
chez les Français,
et si le peu d'hommes
que ce conseil m'a envoyés
n'avait paniqué et fui,
Sa Majesté célébrerait
une grande victoire.
Hélas, ce n'est pas le cas.
Vous avez pris un risque
en attaquant un ennemi en surnombre.
Vous avez perdu.
Vous avez fui le champ de bataille,
ce qui est condamnable.
C'est l'un des motifs pour lequel
un chevalier compagnon
peut-être destitué
de l'Ordre de la Jarretière.
Mon frère a déjà indiqué
les allégations contre vous,
de mauvaise conduite
en tant que Général
de corps d'armée.
Il a annoncé une purge immédiate
sur tous les postes
où vous aviez autorité.
Monsieur, croyez-moi,
il y a trop de témoins
qui vous diront
qu'Henry Howard
n'a jamais été corrompu
par des considérations personnelles.
Et il n'a jamais perçu
de dessous de table.
Ce conseil doit confirmer
votre destitution de Général
et celle de votre ancien titre
de Capitaine de Boulogne.
Nous vous interdisons
de retourner en France.
Je suis sûr que Sa Majesté
donnera un contrordre,
après que je lui ai parlé.
Sa Majesté a refusé
de vous accorder une audience.
Vraiment ?
Monsieur Richard Rich.
Des nouvelles ?
J'ai le regret de vous informer
qu'Eustace Chapuys,
Ambassadeur Impérial, est mort,
après son retour en Espagne.
C'était un homme remarquable.
Et un vrai ami.
Je n'ai plus personne.
Je peux vous assurer
que vous avez encore
de nombreux amis à la cour.
Dont l'Évêque Gardner.
Edmund Bonner, l'Évêque de Londres,
et bien d'autres
partageant votre foi catholique.
Qui continuent à croire,
comme vous.
Et vous ?
Aussi.
Mon pauvre frère
est devenu Protestant et hérétique.
Et le Roi ne fait rien
pour l'empêcher.
Soyez assurée
que tout est fait pour y arriver.
Mais Messire Gardner doit savoir
s'il a votre soutien
pour cette besogne...
Même s'ils devaient interroger
vos proches.
Saluez Sa Grâce pour moi.
Dites-lui que je prierai ardemment
pour son succès.
Anne Askew.
- Oui, Monsieur.
- Nous avons appris
que vous aviez prêché l'hérésie
en public.
Je prêche la parole de Dieu.
À ceux qui veulent.
Vous auriez des amis à la cour.
Et je crois
que votre frère a servi le Roi.
Il se peut que ces amis
soient certaines des suivantes
de Sa Majesté.
Comme la Duchesse de Suffolk.
Ou Lady Herbert,
la sœur de la Reine.
Vous avez reçu de l'argent
pour vous aider
durant votre emprisonnement.
Nous pensons...
que des femmes importantes
vous l'ont envoyé.
Un homme en manteau bleu
m'a donné dix shillings.
Et qu'a-t-il dit ?
Il a dit
"Madame Hertford m'envoie."
Avec le soutien et la permission
de la Reine.
Allons, allons, Maîtresse Askew !
Nous pouvons vous faire parler.
Faites-la déplacer
un niveau en dessous de la chambre.
- Je ne peux autoriser...
- Vous ferez ce que nous dirons...
Sir Edmund.
Pitié, pitié !
Maîtresse Askew.
Votre Grâce a été mal informée
concernant les événements de Boulogne.
Je veux bien le croire.
Le Conseil refuse toujours
d'envoyer les renforts
que j'ai demandés.
Même la garnison de Calais
a refusé de nous aider,
envoyant des hommes aux pieds plats,
et d'autres
incapables de porter des armes.
Et maintenant,
j'ai été relevé de mon commandement.
Je ne suis plus en service.
Inactif.
Je dois rester enfermé chez moi.
N'y voyez pas la fin de votre vie.
Dieu vous a donné grâce,
courage, et libéralité.
Et après Saint-Étienne,
vous avez aussi eu de la chance.
La chance vous a fui un moment,
mais si le reste continue,
alors vous serez bientôt
à nouveau service au du Roi...
et vous aurez l'opportunité
de redorer
votre honneur et votre réputation.
Je vous remercie,
mais à vrai dire, j'ai été desservi
et attaqué dès le début
de mon commandement à Boulogne.
Et maintenant, je vous jure
qu'Hertford fera tout
pour usurper ma place.
Je vous conseillerais
- de ne pas vous battre contre Hertford.
- Je n'ai pas le choix.
Votre Grâce, il semble évident
que le Roi mourra
avant que le Prince
ne devienne adulte.
Qui dirigera en attendant ?
Et le royaume ?
Pincez-la, pour l'amour de Dieu,
pincez-la.
Rien de plus.
Nous vous le redemandons.
Quelles suivantes vous ont envoyé
de l'argent ou promis de l'aide ?
Nous voulons savoir
quelles suivantes de la Reine
partagent vos croyances.
Et si la Reine aussi.
- Nous devons tendre encore plus.
- My Lords !
C'est contre les lois du Roi
de torturer une femme !
Je ne pourrais le garder
sur la conscience.
Allons, vous savez très bien
que nous avons l'autorisation
- du Roi de la questionner.
- J'ignore
si vous avez l'accord de Sa Majesté
pour cela.
Allez !
Espèce d'idiote.
Permettez-moi de demander.
Vous dites que les prêtres
ne peuvent faire le corps du Christ ?
Oui, Messire.
Car j'ai lu
que Dieu avait créé l'Homme.
Ce que l'Homme peut créer pour Dieu,
je ne l'ai jamais lu.
Après la consécration,
n'est-ce pas le corps du Christ ?
C'est le pain consacré.
Et si une souris le mangeait
après la consécration ?
Que lui arriverait-il ?
Qu'en dites-vous ?
Stupide femme.
Cette souris serait damnée.
Pauvre souris.
Qu'est-ce ?
Votre Majesté,
je dois vous dire qu'Anne Askew
est torturée en violation complète
des lois de Votre Majesté.
Vous êtes venu me voir.
Alors je vais vous le dire,
pour soulager votre conscience.
En cas d'hérésie extrême,
les lois ne font aucune différence
entre hommes et femmes.
Pour votre gouverne,
le diable peut prendre
plusieurs formes.
Mais c'est toujours...
le diable.
Réveillez-vous.
Réveillez-vous !
Nous désirons vous interroger
au sujet de la Reine.
Allons.
Parlez, madame.
Sa Majesté, le Roi !
Communes du parlement,
je m'adresse à vous aujourd'hui
pour vous dévoiler le fond
de mes pensées et de mon cœur.
Ce royaume devrait vivre
en parfaite harmonie.
Pourtant, ce n'est partout
que discorde et dissension.
Le clergé fait-il preuve
d'amour et de charité
lorsqu'en son sein,
l'un accuse l'autre d'hérésie ?
Tandis que l'autre le dit papiste
et hypocrite ?
Est-ce la preuve de votre charité ?
Est-ce le signe
d'un amour fraternel ?
Le peuple cherche la lumière.
Vous leur apportez les ténèbres.
Quant aux laïcs,
vous n'êtes pas dénués
de malveillance et d'envie
quand vous calomniez
les prêtres et les évêques.
Vous vous permettez
de juger le clergé
à la seule lumière
de vos opinions grotesques
et de votre vanité.
Vous êtes autorisés
à lire les Saintes Écritures,
mais vous devez comprendre
que c'est une tolérance
qui ne doit servir
qu'à nourrir votre âme.
Pas à les contester
ni à les réécrire.
Je vous ai donné
la Bible en anglais.
Je suis navré de voir
la précieuse parole divine...
discutée, tournée en mauvais vers
que l'on braille
dans toutes les tavernes du royaume.
Dieu a fait de moi
son représentant sur terre.
Je veillerai à ce que ces discordes
et ces outrages cessent.
Ou je serais
un bien piètre serviteur de Dieu.
Donc,
soyez charitables entre vous,
comme un frère envers son frère.
Aimez,
craignez et servez Dieu.
En tant que chef suprême,
je vous y exhorte
et l'exige de vous.
Je suis certain
que l'amour
dont je parlais tout à l'heure
et qui nous unit, ne s'évanouira
et ne sera jamais brisé.
Qu'a dit le Roi, Sir Thomas ?
Il est fâché des discordes
religieuses dans le royaume.
Les gens peuvent lire la Bible,
mais n'ont pas le droit de débattre
de son sens.
Il me semble que Sa Majesté
est comme celui qui pousserait
un homme du haut d'une tour
et lui demanderait
de s'arrêter à mi-chemin.
Nous voilà délivrés de la tyrannie
de Rome et d'une foi aveugle,
mais la Réforme n'est pas finie,
le renouveau du christianisme
non plus
Le Roi croit être le seul
à connaître la volonté de Dieu.
Ses convictions
doivent être la nouvelle orthodoxie,
même si c'est une lubie.
C'est sa religion personnelle.
Pourtant,
il prône l'amour et la charité.
Il n'en est pas moins le Roi.
En réclamant la charité et l'amour,
il fait ce que le Christ a fait.
Madame, le Roi
a ouvert la boîte de Pandore.
Qu'il le veuille ou non,
il ne peut plus la refermer,
même s'il s'en plaint.
Vous avez l'air troublé.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Je crains plus que jamais
les machinations des hommes.
Leurs conspirations déferlent
sur la cour et le roi.
Je le sens, mais je ne suis plus
au courant de rien.
Plus personne, encore moins le Roi,
ne se confie à moi.
N'est-ce pas mieux ainsi ?
En un sens, puisque cela me laisse
libre de vous aimer à loisir.
D'un autre côté, cela me nuit
de négliger les affaires du royaume,
surtout maintenant.
Les hommes conspirent
pour assurer leur avenir.
Je ne comprends pas.
Comment assurent-ils leur avenir ?
En contrôlant le Prince.
La plupart supposent
que les infirmités du Roi s'aggravent.
Il ne vivra pas
jusqu'à la majorité du Prince.
Aimez-vous toujours le Roi ?
- Messire Hertford.
- Majesté.
Nous sommes en paix avec la France.
Seulement si Votre Majesté
en accepte les termes.
Quels sont-ils ?
Dans huit ans,
Votre Majesté devra rendre Boulogne,
en échange d'une somme de 2 millions
de couronnes.
Deux millions ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
L'Amiral de France,
Claude d'Annibault,
viendra à votre cour
signer le traité de paix.
Si Votre Majesté le souhaite.

C'est très bien, Lord Hertford.
Sa Grâce, l'évêque Gardner,
a interrogé l'hérétique, Anne Askew,
et demande la permission d'arrêter
trois suivantes de Sa Majesté,
y compris sa sœur, Lady Herbert.
Sa Grâce voudrait les interroger
car elles sont en possession
d'ouvrages interdits.
Quoi ?
Restez à la porte.
Oui, Messire.


C'est une grande entreprise,
dont dépend notre vie.
Nous devons d'abord décider
comment approcher de Windsor
et de quelle manière vaincre
les gardes qui entourent le Prince.
Et ensuite, l'enlever.
Car cela ne fait aucun doute,
messieurs,
que celui qui possède
l'héritier au trône,
possédera bientôt le trône lui-même.
Sa Majesté, la Reine !
Messire Risley.



Puis-je danser ?
Bien sûr, My Lady.
Messire Hertford.
Je me réjouis de votre retour.
Merci, Votre Majesté.
L'évêque Gardner a arrêté ma sœur
et deux de mes suivantes.
Comment avance l'enquête ?
Très bien.
Nous avons découvert certains livres
parmi les affaires
des suivantes de la Reine,
au sujet desquels
elles seront interrogées.
Et l'hérétique, Anne Askew ?
Je suis heureux de vous annoncer
que sur ordre de Sa Majesté,
elle est condamnée
à être brûlée à Smithfield.
Attrapez-le !
Lord Surrey,
vous êtes arrêté pour trahison.

Que voulez-vous, My Lady ?
Tenez.
Attachez ceci autour de son cou.
Cela abrègera ses souffrances.
Prenez-le.
Pas pour l'argent,
mais pour l'amour de Dieu.

Que voulez-vous ?
Vous faire savoir
que l'évêque Gardner désire vous voir,
bientôt.
Qu'est-ce ?
De la poudre à canon,
cadeau d'une amie.

Si le Roi mourait
alors que le Prince
est encore un enfant,
avez-vous imaginé ou suggéré
que quelqu'un le dirige ?
Si c'est le cas,
avez-vous dit qu'alors,
vous le placeriez
sous votre autorité ?
Ou des paroles similaires ?
Oui, oui, cousin Knyvit.
J'ai compris la question.
Est-il vrai que vous affichez
les armoiries du Roi Edward ?
Et prétendez
être son héritier direct ?
Je mets uniquement mes armoiries
là où j'ai le droit de le faire,
Sir Richard.
Je vous le dis,
si vous deviez avoir du pouvoir
dans ce royaume,
je partirais à l'étranger
et y resterais.
J'aurais trop peur
de votre malveillance.
Cousin Knyvit, ma malveillance
ne s'abaisserait pas jusqu'à vous.
Ma malveillance vise bien plus haut.
Sa malveillance vise plus haut ?

Mes informateurs disent
que l'intention
de Surrey et ses acolytes
était d'usurper le pouvoir
en assassinant
les membres du Conseil et en étant
les seuls à contrôler le Prince.
Dieu a empêché le succès
d'une entreprise aussi abominable !

Dieu merci, tout a été découvert.
Je l'aimais.
J'ai toujours su
qu'il était fier et dénué de bon sens
Mais je l'aimais pour ça.
Et il a trahi mon amour.
Martin.
Messire.
Avez-vous la dague ?
Oui, Messire.
C'est bien.
Venez par ici.
C'est la rivière.
Elle monte à la marée haute.
Je suis certain
de pouvoir passer dans le trou.
Allez au quai Ste Catherine,
prenez un bateau et attendez-moi.
Je devrais y être à minuit.
Pour l'amour de Dieu, Martin,
faites ce que je dis,
car si je ne m'échappe pas d'ici...
Oui, Messire.
Ma sœur.
Allons, allons ! Ne pleurez plus.
Vous avez été relâchée !
Ils n'ont rien trouvé.
Tout va aller pour le mieux.
Croyez-moi.
Tout va aller pour le mieux.
Chère Anne, vous êtes en sécurité.
En sécurité.
<i>Fermez la porte !</i>
Il s'échappe ! À l'aide !
My Lords, membres du jury,
pour chacun des crimes
qu'il a commis,
Le comte mérite la mort.
D'abord, pour avoir usurpé
les armoiries royales,
ce qui laisse penser
qu'il espérait devenir roi.
Ensuite,
pour s'être échappé de prison,
prouvant ainsi sa culpabilité.
Vous mentez !
Et pour une pièce d'or,
vous dénonceriez votre propre père !
Je n'ai jamais voulu
usurper les armoiries
car tous savent que mes aïeux
les portaient !
Allez à l'église de Norfolk.
Vous les y verrez,
elles sont à nous depuis 500 ans.
Retenez-vous, Messire !
Vous avez comploté
afin de devenir roi !
Et vous !
Espèce de blaireau !
En quoi ça vous concerne ?
Vous devriez vous taire,
car ce royaume se porte très mal
depuis que le Roi a mis des gens
comme vous dans son gouvernement !
Silence dans la cour !
Silence !
Si, selon vous,
ces accusations sont fausses,
pourquoi avoir
tenté de vous évader de la Tour ?
Pour éviter de me retrouver
dans la situation où
je suis actuellement.
Et vous, Messire,
savez très bien
que même si un homme
est dans son droit,
on le jugera coupable
s'il a trébuché.
Vous êtes responsable
de votre situation.
C'était un ennemi amical.
Mon ombre bien-intentionnée.
Mon vieux compagnon...
et cher ami qui m'a piégé.
Henry Howard, comment plaidez-vous ?
Non-coupable.
Comment serez-vous jugé ?
Par Dieu
et par la patrie.
Je savais que je le haïssais.
Mais je suis surpris
que vous partagiez mon antipathie.
Vous ne devriez pas l'être
puisque le Comte
nous déteste tous les deux.
C'est sûr
que nous allons mieux
prospérer sans lui.
Certes.
Messires, excusez-moi.
Mais en tant que chef du jury,
je dois vous dire
que nous ne sommes pas convaincus
par les preuves contre Lord Surrey.
Pour nous, il est clair
qu'il a le droit de porter
les armoiries d'Edward le Confesseur.
En ce qui concerne le complot
contre Sa Majesté,
nous ne trouvons
aucune preuve l'accréditant.
Messires...
nous trouvons injuste
que le Comte soit condamné pour des...
broutilles.
Quand l'innocence a-telle suffi
pour sauver la vie d'un homme
que le Roi le juge indigne
de vivre dans le royaume ?
C'est un procès selon les règles.
Maître Hayden,
si vous ne le saviez pas déjà,
vous le savez désormais.
Sa Majesté décide de la loi.
Si vous la provoquez,
alors, vous aussi subirez
toute sa force.
Qu'y a-t-il, Lady Mary ?
Êtes-vous malade ?
Non, madame.
Alors ?
J'ai entendu des rumeurs.
Des rumeurs à quel sujet ?
D'après
le nouvel ambassadeur impérial
à Anvers et d'autres villes,
on dit que le Roi
cherche une nouvelle épouse.
Pourquoi dire ça ?
Malgré la durée de votre mariage,
vous n'avez pas donné d'enfant
à Sa Majesté.
Nous étions très amies.
Vous vous en souvenez.
Pour ma part, rien n'a changé.
Et je vous aime comme auparavant.
Mais il s'est passé quelque chose,
et vous ne m'aimez plus comme avant.
Pourquoi ?
Messieurs les jurés,
quel est votre verdict ?
Coupable !
Et il doit mourir !
De quoi suis-je coupable ?
Il n'y certainement pas de loi
qui fonde le verdict.
Mais je sais que le Roi
veut se débarrasser
de tous les nobles autour de lui.
Et n'employer
que des hommes de basse classe.
- <i>Non coupable !</i>
- <i>Ce procès est une imposture !</i>
<i>Pas de coupe-coupe !</i>
Henry Howard...
Vous serez emmené
là d'où vous venez,
et serez traîné à travers Londres
jusqu'au lieu d'éxécution
de Tyburn !
Et là, vous serez pendu,
éventré vivant,
vos parties privées coupées,
et vos viscères enlevées
et brûlées devant vous.
Votre tête tranchée,
et votre corps découpé en quatre.
La tête et le corps seront disposés
aux endroits
que le Roi choisira lui-même.
<i>Où est le Roi ?</i>
<i>C'est une mascarade !</i>
<i>Voilà ce qui rend une vie heureuse.</i>
<i>Un esprit en paix,</i>
<i>un égal pour ami,</i>
<i>ni rancune, ni querelle,</i>
<i>la sagesse et la simplicité,</i>
<i>une nuit libérée de ses fardeaux.</i>
- <i>Merci, Lord Risley.</i>
- <i>Le Roi est sauvé des complots.</i>
<i>Et Anne Askew...</i>
Chérie, j'ai su que vous vous occupiez
avec vos livres.
Oui Majesté.
J'ai traduit des œuvres
d'Erasme et Savonarole
et j'ai aussi acheté un beau livre
de psaumes de Thomas Berthelet.
Votre sérieux me préoccupe.
Je considère cela comme un devoir
autant qu'un plaisir
que de montrer d'aussi beaux livres
au bon peuple anglais
qui a depuis longtemps eu soif
de simple connaissance
de la Parole de Dieu.
Soyez prudente.
Tout Anglais ne peut pas lire
ou comprendre les Évangiles.
Vous devez vous méfier
des conséquences à les y inciter.
Je ne crains pas les Évangiles,
et personne ne devrait.
Votre Majesté a commencé
une grande entreprise
en bannissant
la monstrueuse idole de Rome.
Maintenant, grâce à Dieu,
vous pouvez achever ce travail
en purgeant l'Église d'Angleterre
de sa lie.
Pardonnez-moi.
Je suis fatigué.
Quel changement quand les femmes
deviennent instruites,
quel réconfort dans ma vieillesse
si ma femme m'instruit.
Votre Majesté n'a nul besoin
d'être instruit par quiconque.
Votre savoir religieux dépasse
celui des princes
et devins de tous temps.
Pardonnez-moi,
mais je trouve déplacé
que l'un de vos sujets
débate avec vous,
comme la Reine vient de le faire.
Beaucoup de sujets éminents
de notre pays
défendant les mêmes thèses qu'elle
ont de par la loi mérité la mort.
Je ne peux croire
que vous accuseriez la Reine
d'hérésie sans preuve.
Je détiens la preuve.
Il est possible de faire un procès.
Elle pourrait être jugée.
Et pourtant,
je veux absolument épargner sa vie.
Certainement.
Comme le désire Sa Majesté.
<i>Previously...</i>
I congratulate Your Majesty.
You have capted one
of the most french beautiful town.
We have gained here a singular victory.
I mean to hold onto it.
I'll leave Surrey in command.
- Surrey?
- Yes. Is that a problem?
Those men that are made
by the King of vile birth
have been the distraction of all
the nobility of this realm.
And if God calls away the King,
they will suffer for it.
You'll teach the Earl
a lesson in humility.
You could arrange for some
misfortune to befall him.
I hear your master has signed
a separate treaty with the French.
I trusted him.
You should be relieved
that you no longer
have to lie on his behalf!
Sister, you know that I never
wanted to marry the King.
I may at least use
what influence I now possess
to further the cause that
I believe in with all my heart.
She's a heretic
and still you leave me in her care!
I swear that I will burn
however many heretics I have to.
I will make England faithful again.
The King's enterprise
has bankrupted our exchequer.
We don't know how to get revenues
to pay for the Boulogne campaign.
This war has proved disastrous
to the realm.
Even our Queen is a heretic.
And it will be God's work
to destroy her.
I want my victory to be celebrated
in every house in England.
I want the name Boulogne
imprinted on every English heart.
Henry's Team

Majesty.
I will have no married priests.
Your Majesty.
Lord Hertford desires an audience.
Hertford.
Your Majesty. We have
received news from France.
The Earl of Surrey,
while rashly attacking
French supply forces at Saint-Etienne,
just beyond Boulogne,
has lost over 600 men,
as well as all the captains
and gentlemen,
who, for some reason,
he had placed in the front line.
My lords, I have heard
from several sources
of the calamitous events
in Boulogne.
It seems my Lord Surrey
gave battle to a large
convoy of French,
and was soundly defeated.
With the death of his captains,
and most of his gentlemen.
And all of this,
despite my warnings not to be bold
and place Boulogne at risk.
Therefore,
I have commanded him to return here,
to be examined as to his conduct
by Your Lordships.
In the meantime,
I will appoint you, My Lord Hertford,
as his replacement.
You leave at once for Boulogne.
I have also decided
for his many great works and talents,
to appoint my secretary,
Mr. Risley, Lord Chancellor,
and to create him Baron Risley.
I am touched and...
deeply honored
by Your Majesty's trust.
- My Lord Suffolk?
- Majesty,
there are rumors
of a large French fleet
being assembled
and fitted out for war.
Also... the Emperor has ordered
all English ships and properties
in the Low Countries to be seized.
How shall we respond?
The Emperor...
my God.
When I think of my fidelity
to my friends
and all of their betrayals?
Fleet being amassed...
- My Lord Hertford.
- Excellency.
May we speak a moment, privately?
Well?
It seems that many things are amiss
in His Majesty's kingdom.
What things?
The bad harvest and the burden
of His Majesty's debts.
The plague among the sailors
of His Majesty's fleet
with their swollen heads
and decayed ships.
Pray, Excellency,
what is your point?
The poisoning and the poverty...
of the King's realm...
is in every way due to his rash
and unsustainable
occupation of Boulogne...
As Your Lordship would want.
It is true that I argued
against the war.
But I lost the argument.
You lost the argument for war,
But you can win it for peace.
Persuade the King...
of his folly
in hanging on to Boulogne,
against all reason.
You and I may come
to some agreement.
- My Lord.
- Mr. Risley, Your Grace.
You are to be congratulated.
Thank you, Your Grace.
I confess,
I find this sudden elevation
beyond my imagining.
No!
But you must imagine it,
and take great pleasure in it,
as we do.
For surely, this must mean
that our cause is in the ascendancy,
and that His Majesty tends
ever more firmly
towards the Orthodox, and Catholic
persuasion and against Reform.
Well, I trust Your Grace is right.
But for my own part,
I still find the King so changeable,
I wonder if he knows his own mind.
Father!
Come here!
It's good to see you back at Court.
I missed you.
- You remember Brigitte?
- Yes, of course!
Bonjour, Henry.
I'm very happy to see you again.
Mademoiselle Roussello
is now my official mistress.
I am sorry to hear that her presence
at Court makes your mother,
unhappy.
But there is no help for it,
for your mother has made me
unhappy for a long time.
- Poor Henry.
- No.
He's old enough to know the truth.
And guess other things about love.
Mademoiselle,
if you make my father happy,
then you have also made me happy.
See?
He's older and wiser than he looks.
- So are you.
- Right.
Drinks.
- How is Your Majesty?
- I'll tell you this, Kate.
I felt ten times better in France
than I have these past years since.
What I hate above everything...
are the interpretations.
It doesn't seem to matter
who I talk to at Court.
Ambassadors,
clerics,
courtiers...
They all interpret the facts
to suit themselves.
God knows I've always spoken
with candour and honesty.
But all about me now is guile,
hypocrisy, and dishonesty.
Your Majesty, I have written a book.
May I show it to you?
A book?
What kind of book?
It's called
Lamentations of a Sinner.
Majesty.
Do read the dedication.
"In praise of my most
sovereign lord and husband,
"King Henry VIII,
"who is not only godly and learned,
"but who is also our Moses,
"since he has delivered us
out of the captivity of the Pharaoh."
You mean Rome.
You call the Pope's clergy riffraff,
which he planted in his tyranny?
"And in eternal gratitude
to my Lord and husband,
"who has shown me by his works
a holier path,
"and delivered me from
the ignorance of my blind faith."
- Do you mean this?
- I do, Your Majesty.
And not just for myself.
I mean it for all your subjects.
Your Majesty.
Bishop Gardner is here.
I ask permission...
To arrest and interrogate a known...
Heretic and Protestant
called Anne Askew,
for fear that she has...
friends here at Court.
You have my permission, Your Grace.
Good English people.
They tell us
that some of us are not fit
to read the words
of our Saviour and Lord.
I say to you, I would rather
read five lines in the Bible
than hear five masses in the temple!
The priest claims to turn
the wine into God's blood,
and the bread into God's body!
But where is the proof?
Go and find
the proof yourself!
Let the bread lie in the box
for three months, it will be mouldy,
and so turn to nothing that is good.
- Make way!
- Wherefore, I am persuaded
that it cannot be God!
- Arrest that woman!
- Faith
is my shield.
I now rejoice at heart,
and hope bid me do so,
for that you shall take my part
and ease me of my woe!
For that you hurt my delight.
No face, Lord, to those who look...
My Lord Surrey,
it has been put to us
that your defeat at Saint-Etienne
was not, as you claimed,
due to the unwillingness
of your soldiers,
but to your own folly.
And an empty confidence
in your own unreasoning bravery.
- How do you answer such a charge?
- I would answer
it was not such a defeat.
There was loss
and victory on both sides,
and as a matter of fact,
the enemy took more losses than we.
Even so, my Lord, our loss
was the more grievous,
since we lost all our captains,
who you, regardless of the danger,
- sent into the front line.
- I think you were never in battle.
Those officers wanted
to be in the front line.
They charged with a cry
and with greater courage
and in as good an order
as anyone would wait for.
They were outnumbered,
but they broke through the enemy lines.
They destroyed four-fifths
of the convoy.
At that moment,
the French were in disarray,
and if the few men
that this council had sent me
had not panicked and bolted,
then His Majesty would now
be celebrating a great victory.
But alas, my Lord, he is not.
You took a risk in attacking
an enemy far superior in numbers,
and you lost.
You were forced to flee
the battlefield, which is reprehensible.
And one of only three ways
by which a knight companion
can be degraded
from the Order of the Garter.
My Lord Surrey,
my brother, has already
announced allegations against you
for corrupt misuse of office
while you were Lieutenant General.
He has announced
an immediate purge on those
that you appointed
to positions of authority.
Sir, believe me.
There are just too many witnesses
that will tell you
that Henry Howard
was never corrupted
by personal considerations.
Nor did his hand ever
close upon a bribe.
This council must confirm
your removal as Lieutenant General,
as well as revoke your former
title, Captain of Boulogne.
You are ordered
not to return to France.
I'm sure His Majesty will see fit
to countermand these orders
- after I have talked with him.
- My Lord,
His Majesty has refused
to grant you an audience.
Has he?
Sir Richard Rich.
You have some news?
I regret to inform you
that Eustace Chapuys,
once Imperial Ambassador here,
has died,
soon after returning to Spain.
He was a remarkable man.
And a true friend.
Now, I have nobody.
Let me assure you
that you still have many true friends
here at Court.
Not least, Bishop Gardner.
And Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London,
as well as many others
who share the Catholic faith.
Who continue to believe
as you believe.
And you?
Yes.
My poor brother is being brought up
a Protestant and a heretic.
And the King does nothing
to stop it.
Be assured,
there is work a foot to stop it.
But My Lord Gardner needs to know
that in these works,
he has your support...
Even though they may touch
people close to you.
Send my love to His Grace.
Tell him I will pray fervently
for his success.
Anne Askew.
- Yes, sir.
- We hear that you still
openly, and in public,
preach heresy.
I preach the Word of God, sir.
To all who will listen.
It seems you have friends at Court.
But then, your brother once served
in the King's household, I think.
We think these friends may include
some ladies in waiting
to Her Majesty.
The Duchess of Suffolk, for example.
Or Lady Herbert, the Queen's sister.
You've received monies,
whilst you've been imprisoned,
for your relief.
We believe...
That diverse important ladies
sent you that money.
There was a man in a blue coat
who delivered me ten shillings.
And what did he say?
He said,
"My Lady Hertford sent it to me."
With the support
and permission of the Queen.
Come, come, Mistress Askew!
We can make you speak.
Have her moved down
one level to the chamber.
- Your Grace, I cannot allow...
- You will do as we say...
Sir Edmund.
Please. Please!
Mistress Askew.
Your Grace has been misinformed
as to the events in Boulogne.
I am very prepared to believe it.
Again and again, the Council refused
to send reinforcements
that I asked for.
Even the garrison at Calais
refused to help,
except to send some flat-footed,
squint-eyed, unshapely men
unfit to carry arms.
And now, my command is revoked.
Now, I am a man of no service.
No activity.
And I must sit at home
within the walls.
Do not think of this
as the end of your life, My Lord.
God has given you grace,
courage, liberality.
And after Saint-Etienne,
He also gave you good luck.
Luck deserted you for a moment,
but if the rest go on,
then you will soon serve
the King's Majesty again, and...
have every chance to regain
your honor and reputation.
I thank you for your words,
but the truth of it is,
I was undermined
and attacked from the start
of my command in Boulogne.
And now, I swear to you,
Hertford will smart
for usurping my place.
I would counsel Your Lordship
- not to raise arms against Hertford.
- I haven't the choice.
Your Grace, it's sure
the King will die
before the Prince reaches
his maturity.
So who will then govern the Prince?
And the realm?
Just pinch her, for God's sake.
Just pinch her that's all.
Nothing more.
We ask you again.
Which of the ladies
of Her Majesty's chamber sent
you monies or promises of relief?
We want to know which
of the Queen's Ladies
share your beliefs.
Or if the Queen herself does.
- We must stretch her further.
- My Lords!
It is absolutely against
the King's Law to rack a woman!
And I will do it no further
on my conscience.
Come, come, you know perfectly well
we have the authority
- of the King himself to examine her.
- I do not know at all
that you have His Majesty's
permission for this.
Come!
You foolish woman.
Let me ask you something.
Do you say that priests cannot
make the body of Christ?
I say so, My Lord.
For I have read that God made man.
But that man can make God,
I have never yet read.
And after the consecration,
is it not the body of Christ?
It is but consecrated bread.
And what if a mouse eats it
after the consecration?
What shall become of that mouse?
What say you?
Stupid woman.
I say that mouse is damned.
Poor mouse.
What is it?
Your Majesty, I must tell you
that the woman Anne Askew
has been put to torture in absolute
violation of Your Majesty's laws.
You were right to come and see me.
So I may explain to you,
and ease your conscience.
In cases of extreme heresy,
the law makes no distinction
between a man and a woman.
For as you know, Sir Edmund,
the devil takes many forms.
And yet, it is always the devil.
Wake up.
Wake up!
We desire to ask you again
about the Queen.
Come, now.
Speak, lady.
His Majesty, the King!
My well-beloved Commons,
I come here today to speak with you,
to set forth my mind
and the secrets of my heart.
There should be perfect love
and concord in this realm.
But instead, there is discord
and dissention in every place.
What love and charity
is there amongst the clergy
when one calls the other
heretic and Anabaptist?
And the other calls
him Papist and hypocrite?
Are these tokens of charity
amongst you?
Are these the signs
of fraternal love?
The people look for light.
And you bring them darkness.
And as for the laity,
you are not clean
of malice and envy,
for you slander
and rebuke priests and bishops.
You take it upon yourself
to judge the clergy
by the sole light
of your fantastical opinions
and vain expositions.
Although you are permitted
to read Holy Scripture,
you must understand that it is
under license
and only to inform your conscience.
Not to dispute and make scripture.
I gave you the Bible
in your own tongue,
but I am sorry to see that most precious
jewel, the Word of God,
has been disputed, rhymed,
sung and jangled
in every alehouse
and every tavern in this realm.
I, whom God has appointed
his Vicar here,
will see these divisions extinct,
and those enormities corrected.
Or God shall account me
an unprofitable servant.
Therefore...
be of charity with one another,
like brother and brother.
Love, dread, and serve God,
to which I, as your supreme head,
and sovereign Lord
exhort and require you.
And I doubt not,
but that love and affinity
which I spoke of at the beginning
shall never be dissolved
or broken between us.
What did the King say, Sir Thomas?
He was angry with the religious
divisions in his realm.
He said that he gave people
the Bible to read,
but not so that they could
dispute its meanings.
It seems to me like His Majesty
is like one who would throw a man
headlong off the top of a high tower
and ask him to stop when
he is halfway down.
But surely, our delivery from
the tyranny of Rome and blind faith
is not the end of the Reform
and the renewal of our Christian life,
but it is only the beginning.
The King does suppose
that only he knows the Will of God,
and so whatever he thinks
should therefore be the new Orthodoxy,
however fantastical.
It is like his own private religion.
And yet, he asks for an end
to division for charity and love.
Sir Thomas, he is still the King.
And if he asks for charity and love,
then he is doing
no more than Christ did.
Madam, the King has opened
a Pandora's Box.
And whether he will or not,
he simply cannot close it now,
whatever his complaints.
You look troubled. What is it?
I fear now, more than ever
the machinations of men.
How their plots and plans swirl
about the Court and the King.
I can sense it, but I have
no knowledge anymore.
No one, it seems, least of all the King,
confides in me.
But is it not better so?
In some ways, since it leaves me free
to love you at my leisure.
But in other ways, it condemns my high
station to neglect affairs of the realm,
especially now.
Men conspire to secure his future,
and their own profit.
But I don't understand.
How can they secure the future?
By controlling the Prince.
It's widely supposed
the King's infirmities grow worse.
And he will not live to see
the Prince come to maturity.
Do you still love the King?
- My Lord Hertford.
- Majesty.
So. There is peace with France.
Only if Your Majesty
accepts the terms.
What are the terms?
In 8 years' time,
Your Majesty
will hand back Boulogne.
In return for a payment
of 2 million crowns.
2 million?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The Admiral of France,
Claude d'Annibault,
will come here to Your Majesty's
court to sign the peace treaty.
If Your Majesty so desires.
Your Majesty?
You've done well, my Lord Hertford.
My Lord.
Majesty.
His Grace, Bishop Gardner, having
examined the heretic Anne Askew,
requests Your Majesty's permission
to order the arrests
of three of Her Majesty's ladies,
including Her Majesty's sister,
Lady Herbert.
His Grace would like
to question them
as to their knowledge and keeping
of forbidden materials
What?
Stay at the door.
Yes, my Lord.
Gentlemen.
My Lord.
Here is a very great undertaking,
upon which our lives will depend.
But what we must first decide
is how best to approach Windsor...
and in what manner to overcome
the guards that surround the Prince.
And so, remove him.
For, be in no doubt, gentlemen,
that he who possesses
the heir to the throne
will very soon possess
the throne itself.
Her Majesty, the Queen!
My Lord Risley.
Your Majesty.
Your Grace.
Your Majesty.
May I dance?
Of course you may, my Lady.
My Lord Hertford.
I am most glad to see you
returned from France.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Bishop Gardner has
arrested my sister
and two of my ladies
on suspicion of heresy.
How go your investigations?
They go well,
for we have discovered certain books
in the closets
of the Queen's ladies,
about which they will be
questioned further.
And the heretic, Anne Askew?
Well I'm happy to tell, good lady,
that on His Majesty's orders,
she is condemned
to be burned at Smithfield.
SEIZE HIM!
My Lord Surrey, you are
under arrest for treason.
Sir.
What does he want, my Lady?
Here.
Tie this around her neck.
It will end her suffering quickly.
Take it.
Not just for the money,
But also for the love of God.
My Lady Hertford.
What do you want?
Just to let you know that Bishop Gardner
would like to see you,
very soon.
What's this?
Gunpowder, gift from a friend.
My Lord Surrey.
If the King should die,
leaving the Lord Prince
at his tender age,
have you either devised or suggested
who should govern him in this realm?
Whether that is, you have ever said
that in such a case,
you would have the rule
and governance of him?
Or words to that effect?
Yes, yes, cousin Knyvit.
I understood the question.
Is it true that you wilfully bear the
Royal Arms of King Edward the Confessor?
And claim to be the next heir
or kin to him?
I only put in my coat of arms
what I am entitled to put there,
Sir Richard.
I'll tell you this,
if ever you got power here,
in this realm,
I wouldgo abroad and stay there.
Because I would be
so afraid of your malice.
Cousin Knyvit, I am maliced
not so low as you.
My malice goes much higher.
He said his malice went even higher?
Yes, Your Majesty.
My informants tell me
that it was the intention
of Surrey and his associates
to usurp authority
by means of the murder
of all members of the Council, and
the control of the Prince by them alone.
God forbid they should have succeeded
in their abominable enterprise!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Thank God the whole was found out.
I used to love him.
Yes, I've always known
he was proud and foolish.
But I loved him for all that.
Now he has forfeited my love.
Martin.
My Lord.
Did you get the dagger?
Yes, my Lord.
Good man.
Come over here.
That's the river.
It comes right up at high tide.
I can just about fit down
the shaft, I'm certain.
Go now, to St. Catherine's dock,
get a boat, wait for me there.
I should be with you by midnight.
For the love of God,
Martin, do as I ask,
for if I do not escape
from this place...
Yes, my Lord.
Sister.
There, there! Weep no more.
You were released!
Nothing has been found.
Everything is going to be all right.
Believe me.
Everything is going to be all right.
Darling Anne, you're safe.
You're safe.
<i>Close the door!</i>
He's escaping! Help me!
My Lords, members of the jury,
for either of the offences
the Earl has committed,
he deserves death.
First, for usurping the Royal Arms,
which gives rise to the suspicion
that he hoped to become King.
The other,
for escaping from prison,
whereby he proved his guilt.
You are false!
And to earn a piece of gold,
would condemn your own father!
I never sought to usurp
the King's Arms,
for everyone knows
my ancestors bore them!
Go to the church in Norfolk.
You will see them there,
for they have been ours
for 500 years.
Hold your peace, my Lord!
Your idea was to commit treason
and become King!
And you!
You cats pole!
What have you to do with it?
You had better hold your tongue,
for this kingdom has never been well
since the King put mean creatures
like you into this government!
Silence in court!
Silence!
If, as you say,
the accusations are false,
can you explain to us
why you tried to escape the Tower?
I tried to escape to prevent
myself from coming to the pass
in which I am now.
And you, my Lord, well know
that no matter how right
a man may be,
they always find
the fallen one guilty.
You have only yourself to blame,
my Lord, for the pass you're in.
It was a friendly foe.
My shadow of good will.
My old companion
and dear friend that trapped me.
Henry Howard, how do you plead?
Not guilty.
How will you be tried?
By God, and the country.
I knew that I hated the Earl.
But I am surprised, Sir Richard,
that you share my antipathy.
My Lord, you should not be
so surprised,
since the Earl hates us
both the same.
So I am sure all of us will prosper
better without him.
I agree.
My Lords, forgive me.
But as foreman of the jury,
I have to tell your Lordships
that we are not impressed with
the evidence against my Lord Surrey.
It is very clear to us
that he has the right to bear the arms
of Edward the Confessor.
And as to the plot
against His Majesty,
we can find no credible
evidence to support it.
Sirs...
we do not think it right that the Earl
should be condemned for such...
trifles.
Whenever has innocence been cause
to save a man's life
when the King deems him unfit
to live in the Commonwealth?
My Lord.
This is a trial under law.
Master Hayden,
if you did not know it before,
then you know it now.
The law is whatever
His Majesty says it is.
And if you provoke His Majesty,
then you too, will feel
the full force of it.
What is wrong, Lady Mary?
Are you unwell?
No, Madam.
Then?
I have heard some rumors.
Rumors about what, Lady Mary?
The new Imperial Ambassador
has told me
that in Antwerp
and in other foreign places,
that they are saying the King
is looking for a new wife.
Why should they say so?
Despite the length of your marriage,
you have still not presented
His Majesty with a child.
Lady Mary.
We were such good friends.
You remember that, don't you?
Well, for me, nothing has changed.
And I love you, as I did before.
But something has happened,
and you no longer love me
as you did before.
Why?
Gentlemen of the jury,
how do you find the defendant?
Guilty!
And he should die for it!
Of what have you found me guilty?
Surely, there is no law
that justifies you.
But I know the King
wants to get rid of all
the noble blood around him.
And employ none but low people.
- <i>Not guilty!</i>
- <i>This trial is a sham!</i>
<i>No chop, chop!</i>
Henry Howard...
You will be taken to the place
from whence you came,
and there, to be dragged
through the city of London
unto the place of execution
called Tyburn!
There, to be hanged,
cut down while still alive,
your privy parts cut off,
and your bowels taken out
of your body and burned before you.
Your head cut off,
and your body divided
into four parts.
The head and the quarters
to be set at such places
as the King shall assign.
<i>Where's the King?</i>
<i>This is a travesty!</i>
<i>The happy life be these.</i>
<i>The quiet mind,</i>
<i>the equal friend,</i>
<i>no grudge, no strife,</i>
<i>wisdom joined with simplicity,</i>
<i>the night discharged of all care.</i>
- <i>Thank you, Lord Risley.</i>
- <i>The King is saved from conspirators.</i>
<i>And Anne Askew...</i>
Sweetheart, I hear you've been busying
yourself with your books.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I have translated works
by Erasmus and Savonarola
as well as buying a beautiful
book of psalms by Thomas Berthelet.
I wonder, Kate, at your diligence.
Well, I regard it as much
my duty as my pleasure,
to place such wonderful books
before the good English people
who have been a long time
thirsting and hungering
for the sincere and plain knowledge
of God's Word.
Just be cautious.
Not every English person can
read or understand the Gospels.
And you are to be careful of the
consequences of encouraging them to try.
Majesty, I am not afraid of the Gospels,
nor should anyone be afraid.
Your Majesty has begun a great work
in banishing
the monstrous idol of Rome.
And now with God's help,
you can finish that work
by purging the Church of England
of its dregs.
Forgive me. I am tired.
Kate.
What a thing it is,
when women become such clerks,
What a comfort it will be in my old age
to be lectured to by my wife.
Your Majesty has no need
to be taught by anyone.
Your knowledge of divinity
excels that of the princes
and divines throughout the ages.
Forgive me,
but I think it unseemly
for any of your subjects
to argue with you,
as the Queen has just done.
Many of the greatest
subjects in the land
defending those same arguments
that she does
have, by law, deserved death.
I cannot believe
that you would accuse the Queen
of heresy without proof.
I have the proof.
But what I need
is Your Majesty's consent
to draw up certain articles
against the Queen,
so that she may be put on trial.
She could be put on trial.
And yet,
I am fully resolved
to spare her life.
Certainly.
Whatever Your Majesty desires.
<i>Précédemment...</i>
Ce royaume devrait être en paix.
Mais ce n'est partout
que discorde et dissension.
Peu importe à qui je m'adresse
à la cour.
Je suis entouré de fourbes
et d'hypocrites.
Je crains plus que jamais
les intrigues de la cour.
Les hommes conspirent pour assurer
leur avenir en contrôlant le Prince.
On élève mon pauvre frère
comme un protestant, un hérétique.
Le Roi ne fait rien pour l'empêcher.
- J'ai écrit un livre.
- Vous raillez le clergé du Pape.
L'évêque Gardiner a arrêté ma sœur
et deux suivantes
soupçonnées d'hérésie.
Nous avons découvert certains livres
appartenant aux suivantes
de la Reine.
Vous avez entrepris
une grande œuvre,
en bannissant l'idole de Rome.
<i>Vous pouvez achever cette œuvre</i>
en éliminant la lie
du clergé d'Angleterre.
Majesté, d'éminents sujets
de ce pays
ont mérité la mort
pour avoir défendu la même théorie.
Je ne peux croire que vous
accusez la Reine d'hérésie.
J'en ai la preuve.

Ces derniers jours,
j'ai beaucoup réfléchi
à l'idée de perte.
Quelle perte, Votre Grâce,
est irrémédiable pour un homme ?
- Sa vertu.
- Non.
Ses actions peuvent
racheter sa vertu.
- Son honneur.
- Non.
Il y a toujours moyen
de le retrouver,
de la même façon
qu'on peut regagner sa fortune.
Je ne sais pas, Majesté.
Le temps,
Votre Grâce.
Aucune perte
n'est plus irrémédiable
que le temps,
car on ne peut le racheter.
Prenez ceci...
avec grand soin et portez-le
à Messire Risley.
Oui, Votre Grâce.
Messire l'Amiral de France.
<i>Salutationes Domine,</i>
<i>Praefectus Magnus Galliae.</i>
<i>Salvete Regis Enrici
octavi maiestatis.</i>
Merci, Votre Altesse.
C'est un grand privilège et honneur
d'être ici.
Puis-je vous présenter
les filles de Sa Majesté, Mary
et Elizabeth ?
Je n'imaginais pas être accueilli
par la famille de Sa Majesté.
Vous êtes un invité de marque,
Amiral D'Annibault.
Votre visite est opportune.
Je suis sûr que Sa Majesté
sera bientôt là.
Lord Hertford semble avoir
les faveurs du Roi.
Je le crains, en effet.
Son pouvoir grandit de jour en jour
en raison des infirmités du Roi
et de son ascendant sur l'enfant.
Que Dieu nous aide,
si le Roi venait à mourir.
Beaucoup de gens disent
que le peuple préférerait
vous voir sacrer reine
plutôt...
que de laisser le pays
à la merci d'un enfant
et de son oncle orgueilleux.
Qu'en est-il de la Reine ?
Vous en saurez plus à ce sujet.
Bientôt.
Le Roi !
Nous sommes ravis d'établir
un nouveau traité avec la France.
Je ne veux plus
avoir affaire à l'Empereur
qui m'a trahi chaque fois.
Nous serons de bons et loyaux amis,
contrairement à lui.
Vous le savez,
j'ai apporté de nombreux changements
à la vie religieuse de mon royaume.
J'ai réformé une Église corrompue.
J'ai balayé
plusieurs siècles
de mensonges et de superstitions.
J'ai révélé à toute l'humanité
que le Pape
n'est qu'un prince comme les autres
et non la voix de Dieu.
Vous savez déjà tout cela.
Je sais très bien
que Votre Majesté a fait
bien des changements
dans son royaume.
Si nous devenons alliés, Monsieur
je propose un autre changement.
Je propose que la messe soit abolie
dans nos deux royaumes
et remplacée par une simple cérémonie
de communion.
Que penseriez-vous de tout cela ?
Je n'ai pas le droit de renégocier
les termes de notre traité
surtout que, comme vous le savez,
mon Roi se meurt.
De la syphilis, je sais.
J'en suis vraiment attristé.
Je connais François depuis longtemps
et je lui envoie tout mon amour.
Mais vous devez aussi lui dire
que sa maladie lui rappelle
sa propre mortalité !
Qu'il avait par le passé oubliée !
J'ai quelque chose pour la Reine.
Je dois l'apporter à Lord Risley.
Quand la Reine l'aura lu,
rendez-le-moi.
... si beau.
Chut, ma sœur.
Qu'y-a-t-il ?
Oh mon Dieu.
Qu'est-ce ?
Qui est-ce ?
C'est Sa Majesté la Reine,
Votre Majesté.
Pourquoi crie-t-elle ainsi ?
Je vais la voir.
Qu'y-a-t-il ?
Je...
Je crains...
que vous soyez fâché après moi.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que...
Je crains
que vous ne m'ayez abandonnée.
Je ne comprends pas.
Pourquoi penser cela ?
Pourquoi serais-je
fâché contre vous ?
Vous n'êtes pas
fâché contre moi ?
Je vous le redemande :
pour quelle raison ?
Il n'y en a pas, Majesté.
Bonjour, My Lady.
Ma sœur !
Mesdames !
Vous devez suivre mes ordres.
Jetez tous vos livres,
qu'ils soient interdits ou non !
À présent, plus de discussions
entre nous
sur aucun sujet religieux
ou controversé,
et je tâcherai de toujours
suivre la pensée du Roi.
Maintenant, allez !
Bonjour.
Puis-je voir Sa Grâce ?
Hélas Monseigneur,
Sa Grâce est souffrante.
Elle a attrapé froid et est alitée.
Je suis navré de l'apprendre.
Je reviendrai quand le Duc
sera rétabli.
Non, non My Lord.
Je suis...
en état de vous voir.
Je sais que votre camp est engagé
dans une lutte sans pitié
contre celui de l'évêque Gardiner.
Je vais vous dire la vérité.
L'infirmité du Roi
et la jeunesse de mon neveu
rendent urgent
le problème de la succession.
Les enjeux sont considérables.
Je suppose que vous voulez savoir
de quel côté je me trouve ?
Votre Grâce,
que vous le vouliez ou non,
vous avez la confiance du Roi
et donc beaucoup d'influence.
Et tout le monde le sait.
Mais peu de gens savent
que votre épouse
et la mienne, ainsi que la Reine,
sont très proches
en matière de religion.
Et que cette affinité
m'a conduit à venir vous voir.
Votre épouse a dû vous dire
que la Duchesse et moi
sommes séparés !
Donc ses penchants
ne sont pas forcément les miens
et vous me faites du tort
en le supposant.
Excusez-moi, Votre Grâce.
Je vous pardonne.
Je vous pardonne même d'avoir causé
la mort de ce pauvre Surrey...
car c'était sa faute.
Mais pour la religion,
je n'ai jamais lu les Évangiles
et je ne le ferai jamais.
Je suis sûr qu'ils vous éclairent,
mais je les préfère mystérieux.
Quant à la promesse
d'un monde meilleur,
je pense que l'Angleterre
était heureuse jadis,
et qu'en fin de compte,
je voudrais que les choses redeviennent
comme par le passé.
Votre Grâce,
si je n'ai pas votre soutien,
puis-je savoir
si vous serez contre moi ?
Je ne sais comment vous répondre,
Lord Hertford.
J'ai toujours aimé
cette expression française :
"Louez le Seigneur,
"buvez le vin
et laissez le monde être le monde."
My Lady Hertford.
J'ai été convoquée ici,
mais je n'en connais pas la raison.
Puis-je vous être utile ?
Vous le pouvez, My Lady,
en me disant la vérité.
Vous étiez une amie
de l'hérétique, Anne Askew,
qui a été brûlée ?
Je la connaissais.
C'était plus qu'une connaissance.
Dans la prison,
un de vos serviteurs,
un homme avec un manteau bleu,
lui a donné de l'argent.
Je voulais rendre sa situation
plus supportable.
J'ai agi par charité chrétienne.
On m'avait dit
que ceux qui l'ont torturée,
illégalement, l'ont écartelée
sur le chevalet
jusqu'à la rupture des ligaments
de ses bras et ses jambes.
Mais vous convenez
qu'elle a avoué elle-même
son hérésie ?
Vous êtes donc suspectée
à cause de cette relation.
Vous avez un ordre d'arrestation ?
Vous ne l'utiliserez jamais.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que je connais votre secret.
Quel secret, My Lady Hertford ?
Vous-même n'êtes pas un saint,
Votre Grâce.
Vous n'avez pas renoncé
aux richesses matérielles,
n'est-ce pas ?
Il y a deux monastères
en Cornouailles
qui ont été pillés et fermés
sur ordre de Sa Majesté, puis brûlés.
Sauf...
qu'ils n'ont été
ni pillés ni brûlés,
mais leurs titres et biens
ont été transférés à Votre Grâce.
Ainsi, vous êtes un homme riche,
en effet,
mais seulement en vous appropriant
les biens du Roi.
Je vous conseille
de déchirer votre ordre.
Sa Majesté la Reine.
Venez donc.
Je suis heureux de vous voir.
Vous allez m'ôter certains doutes.
Je me demande, Kate,
ce que vous pensez apprendre
dans les Évangiles
et autres livres religieux ?
Puisque Dieu vous a désigné
comme notre chef suprême,
c'est de vous que j'apprendrai.
Mais il n'en est pas ainsi.
Vous êtes devenue docteur, Kate,
pour nous instruire,
comme nous l'avons vu auparavant...
mais pas pour être instruite ou dirigée
par nous.
Majesté,
je pense qu'il y a un malentendu
car j'ai toujours trouvé absurde
qu'une femme enseigne à son seigneur.
Pourtant,
vous portez un regard différent du nôtre
sur la religion.
Seulement pour que vous puissiez
me corriger.
Pardonnez-moi, Votre Majesté,
mais je pense que parler et discuter
atténue les douleurs et fatigues
de votre infirmité actuelle.
Cela m'a encouragée
dans ma hardiesse,
dans l'espoir de profiter
de ce que vous m'avez appris.
Je ne suis qu'une femme,
avec les imperfections naturelles
dues à la faiblesse de mon sexe.
En conséquent, dans tous les cas
de doutes et difficultés,
je dois me référer
au jugement de Votre Majesté,
en tant que Seigneur et chef.
C'est ainsi, ma chérie ?
Vous avez trouvé ces arguments,
pour que ça ne soit pas pire ?
Nous sommes à nouveau
de parfaits amis.
Je remercie Votre Majesté.
Je promets
de ne plus jamais douter de vous.
Kate chérie.
Dois-je annuler l'ordre
d'arrêter la Reine demain ?
Pourquoi ?
Musique.
Qu'y a-t-il, mon chéri ?
Rien.
Je rêvais.
Nous étions à Boulogne...
et je vous laissais partir.
Je suis là.
- Le jour s'est levé ?
- Non, pas encore.
Je déteste la nuit.
- C'est comme une nuit perpétuelle.
- Silence, chéri.
Le jour va bientôt se lever,
et vous irez bien.
Oui, mon chéri ?
Je suis si heureux.
Qu'est-ce ?
Grand Chancelier.
Que faites-vous ici ?
Je suis venu pour arrêter la Reine
et l'escorter avec ses suivantes
à la Tour.
Espèce de valet !
Vous n'êtes qu'un valet !
Partez ! Hors de ma vue !
Partez !
Et prenez vos bâtards avec vous.
Je suis...
désolée...
que le Grand Chancelier
ait fait une telle erreur.
Vous ignorez à quel point
il ne mérite pas votre sympathie.
Ce n'est pas votre ami, Kate.
Votre Grâce, je vous l'ai dit,
il m'a traité de valet,
entre autres.
Mais devant qui ?
Supposez qu'il veuille que la Reine
se sente faussement en sécurité.
Sa colère me semblait bien réelle.
My Lords, en l'absence du Roi,
le Conseil a été convoqué
pour annoncer son adhésion
aux termes du traité de paix
avec la France.
Ceux qui sont pour, dites "oui".
Oui.
Le Conseil a aussi été convoqué
pour prendre les dispositions
concernant l'administration
et la sécurité
de Son Altesse, le Prince Edward,
héritier du trône,
et les dispositions
pour son bien-être
matériel et spirituel.
My Lords, prions.
Pourquoi discuter
de telles affaires maintenant,
quand les dispositions ont été prises
pour la sécurité du Prince à Windsor,
sur ordre de Sa Majesté ?
Oui.
Le Conseil a été constitué
pour examiner ces affaires,
surtout depuis que l'infirmité
du Roi
nous oblige à penser au futur.
Et c'est une trahison,
Grand Chancelier,
d'envisager la mort du Roi !
My Lord, seul le Prince
nous importe.
Vous importe ?
Oubliez-vous
que nous sommes du même sang ?
Il est aussi du même sang
que le Roi,
ce qui nous donne le droit de surveiller
ceux qui veillent sur lui.
Et parmi eux,
se trouvent certains de ses professeurs
qui ont été suspectés d'hérésie !
Vous parlez d'hérésie ! Vous !
Vous n'êtes rien que le porcelet
orgueilleux du pape.
Je dis encore, My Lord Hertford...
que vos vraies intentions
envers le Prince et la Couronne
doivent passer avant le Roi.
- Que faites-vous ?
- Enlevez vos mains !
L'évêque Gardner demande une audience
avec Votre Majesté.
Refusée.
Sa Grâce est d'une nature
querelleuse,
et je ne veux plus jamais
la voir ici.
Je désire qu'il quitte ma cour.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Votre Grâce, Sa Majesté
veut que vous quittiez la cour.
Grand Chancelier.
Que puis-je pour vous ?
Pardonnez-moi,
si ça vous est possible,
quelques associations passées
que je regrette.
Je voue une loyauté entière
à la maison de Votre Excellence
et je crois pouvoir vous servir
à l'avenir
aussi fidèlement
que j'ai servi Sa Majesté.
Je vous en suis reconnaissant,
Grand Chancelier.
J'ai une commande pour vous.
Je remercie Votre Majesté.
Votre Majesté pense à un portrait ?
Une fois, vous avez peint mon père.
Là, vous allez me peindre.
J'en suis honoré.
Mon chéri,
mon chéri,
un messager de Sa Majesté est ici.
Votre Grâce,
Sa Majesté
a appris votre indisposition
et a demandé à vous voir.
C'est impossible,
demandez aux médecins.
Que vais-je dire à Sa Majesté ?
Dites-lui...
que j'irai.
Vous ne pouvez pas !
Comment puis-je rester couché,
mon amour,
alors que le Roi me convoque ?
Dites-leur de m'aider.
Que faites-vous ici ?
Je suis venue voir ma fille.
Pourquoi êtes-vous surpris, Henry ?
Vous n'avez pas toujours été bon
pour elle.
J'ai pleuré si souvent
de la voir seule,
abandonnée par son père.
Est-ce la raison de votre retour ?
Pour me réprimander
pour ce que je ne suis pas ?
Elle devrait être mariée
depuis longtemps.
Et avoir ses propres enfants.
Partez,
fantôme.
Partez, Katherine.
Vous m'avez renvoyée auparavant...
alors que je vous aimais.
Mais j'étais encore votre épouse
aux yeux de Dieu.
Et je le suis encore.
Sa Grâce le Duc de Suffolk.
Charles.
J'ai appris que vous étiez malade.
Alors j'ai voulu vous voir.
J'ai eu une légère fièvre.
Votre Majesté
ne devrait pas s'approcher.
Nous nous connaissons
depuis longtemps,
très longtemps.
Et je me souviens de tout.
En fait,
je me rappelle du temps passé
plus que je me rappelle d'hier.
Je me rappelle
la sœur de Votre Majesté.
Et la bataille des éperons.
Et quand Votre Majesté
m'a fait Duc...
Dieu sait pourquoi.
Vous étiez mon général
à York et en France,
car je n'avais confiance qu'en vous.
Et je vous supplie, Charles,
de me croire.
J'ai le pouvoir de vous soigner,
vous le savez.
J'ai appris
que vous étiez presque mort...
mais vous ne mourrez pas.
Je l'interdis.
À genoux.
Par la grâce de Dieu,
moi, Henry VIII,
Roi d'Angleterre,
d'Irlande et de France,
défenseur de la foi
et de l'église d'Angleterre,
vous ordonne de guérir !
My Lady Suffolk.
Puis-je dire,
au nom du personnel de Sa Grâce,
que nous avons le cœur brisé
comme Votre Grâce,
en ce triste jour.
Car nous aimions Sa Grâce,
autant que vous, sa femme,
et son fils l'aimiez.
Merci.
Votre sympathie et votre loyauté
nous touchent profondément.
<i>Requiescant in pace Domini.</i>
<i>Et lux perpetua luceat eis.</i>
<i>Requiescant in pace.</i>
Il sera enterré
à la chapelle de St George à Windsor,
à mes frais.
Je vais vous dire,
My Lord Hertford :
aussi longtemps
que Charles Brandon m'a servi,
il n'a jamais trahi notre amitié
ni profité injustement d'un ennemi.
Je ne peux en dire autant
de n'importe qui d'autre à la cour.
Je n'aurais jamais pensé
qu'il mourrait.
Nous parlerons, My Lord Hertford,
des dispositions
pour la minorité du Prince
après ma mort.
M. Holbein est ici.
Avec votre permission, je viens
vous montrer l'avancement du travail.
Maitre Holbein.
Quand vous avez peint mon père,
vous avez fait le portrait
d'un vieillard et d'un malade.
Il ressemblait plus à un pauvre hère
qu'à un roi d'Angleterre.
Un homme faible, affreux et mourant.
Et vous avez fait la même chose
pour moi.
M. Holbein,
ce portrait est un mensonge !
Refaites-le.
Et partez.
Pourquoi êtes-vous là ?
Pour voir ma fille.
C'est la seule chose pure de ma vie
et je l'ai négligée toute ma vie
car c'était une fille,
et que j'aurais préféré
vous offrir un fils.
Mais maintenant,
je suis si fière d'elle.
Extrêmement fière.
Elle est si intelligente.
Et elle me ressemble
par certains côtés.
Elle n'est pas immodérée comme moi.
Vous devez être fier
d'elle aussi, Henry.
Je le suis.
Je suis fier d'elle.
Je sais qu'elle est intelligente.
Et je souhaiterais l'aimer plus.
Mais de temps en temps,
elle me fait penser à vous
et à ce que vous m'avez fait.
Je ne vous ai rien fait.
J'étais innocente.
Toutes les accusations contre moi
étaient fausses.
Je pensais que vous le saviez.
Pauvre Katherine Howard.
Elle gît sur le sol froid
près de moi.
Pauvre enfant.
Ce n'était pas sa faute non plus.
Mais nous étions comme deux
papillons de nuit attirés par le feu
et brûlés.
Anne, pitié, non !
Sa Majesté, le Roi.
Venez là.
J'ai décidé
de vous envoyer à Greenwich.
Je ne passerai pas Noël avec vous
cette année,
ni ensuite.
- Pourquoi, Votre Majesté ?
- Kate,
ne posez pas de questions.
C'est ainsi.
Vous devez être une mère
gentille et aimante pour votre frère,
quand je laisserai dans ce monde
un enfant sans défense.
Je vous en supplie, père,
ne me laissez pas orpheline
si jeune !
Vous êtes si jeune,
mais vous aussi,
veillez sur votre frère.
Je le promets.
Soyez bénie, mon enfant.
Soyez bénie.
Le temps est venu
de nous faire nos adieux.
C'est la volonté de Dieu.
Quand je mourrai,
ces hommes vous traiteront
comme si j'étais toujours vivant.
Et si vous désiriez vous remarier,
j'ai ordonné
que vous perceviez 7 000 livres par an
à vie, pour votre service,
ainsi que pour vos bijoux
et ornements.
Allez-y.
Comment va mon fils ?
Jane !
Il va bien.
J'ai pris soin de lui...
Jane chérie.
Et bientôt, il sera Roi.
Mon pauvre garçon.
Mon pauvre enfant.
C'est le plus aimé.
C'est mon extraordinaire garçon.
Il mourra jeune.
Pauvre enfant,
vous attendiez trop de lui !
Il était si jeune !
Les rois aussi sont faits d'argile !
Et Dieu vous interdit
de le tenir éloigné du monde,
comme votre père avec vous.
Vous ne comprenez pas ?
Vous l'avez tué !
My Lords, voici mon testament.
Quand je serai mort,
My Lord Hertford aura la fonction
de Protecteur
durant la minorité du Prince Edward.
Il sera aidé
par le Grand Chancelier Risley
et l'archevêque Cranmer.
Je désire
être enterré aux côtés
de ma véritable et aimante épouse,
la Reine Jane Seymour, à Windsor.
Vous érigerez un tombeau,
sur lequel figureront nos effigies,
modelées comme si nous dormions
paisiblement.
M. Holbein vous attend
à la chapelle.
Maitre Holbein,
ça ira.
HENRY VIII MOURUT

<i>Previously...</i>
In this realm,
there should be perfect love.
But instead, there is discord
and dissention in every place.
It doesn't seem to matter
who I talk to at court.
All about me now is guile,
hypocrisy, and dishonesty.
I fear more than ever, the plots
about the court and the King.
Men conspire to secure their future
by controlling the Prince.
My poor brother is being brought up
a Protestant and a heretic.
And the King does
nothing to stop it.
- I have written a book.
- You call the Pope's clergy riff-Raff.
Bishop Gardiner
has arrested my sister
and two of my ladies
on suspicion of heresy.
We have discovered certain books.
In the closets
of the Queen's ladies.
Your Majesty has begun a great work,
banishing
the monstrous idol of Rome.
<i>You can finish that work</i>
by purging the Church of England
of its dregs.
Majesty, many of the greatest
subjects in the land
defending those same arguments
have deserved death.
I cannot believe that you would accuse
the Queen of heresy.
I have the proof.

<i>When we compare
the present life of man on earth</i>
<i>with that time
of which we have no knowledge,</i>
<i>it seems to me like the swift flight</i>
<i>of a single sparrow
through a banqueting hall</i>
<i>on a winter's day.</i>
<i>After a few moments of comfort,</i>
<i>he vanishes from sight</i>
<i>into the wintry world
from which he came.</i>
<i>Even so, man appears on earth</i>
<i>for a little while;</i>
<i>but of what went before this life</i>
or what will follow,
<i>we know nothing.</i>
In these last days
I have been thinking
a great deal about loss.
What loss, Your Grace,
is to man the most irrecoverable?
- His virtue.
- No.
For by his actions,
he may redeem his virtue.
- Then his honor.
- No.
For again, he may find
the means to recover it,
even as a man recovers
some fortune he has lost.
Then I cannot say, Your Majesty.
Time, Your Grace.
Of all losses,
time is the most irrecoverable,
for it can never be redeemed.
Walter!
Take this...
very carefully and give it...
to My Lord Risley.
Yes, Your Grace.
The Lord High Admiral of France.
<i>Salutationes Domine,.</i>
<i>Praefectus Magnus Galliae.</i>
<i>Salvete Regis Enrici
octavi maiestatis.</i>
Thank you, Your Highness.
It is my great privilege
and honor to be here.
My Lord Admiral.
May I present his Majesty's daughters,
the Lady Mary
and the Lady Elizabeth.
I never thought to be welcomed
by His Majesty's family.
You are a special and honored guest,
Admiral D'Annibault.
And your visit most timely.
I am sure His Majesty
will be here presently.
My Lord Hertford seems
to be in the King's good graces.
I fear it seems to be so.
The Earl grows more powerful daily
because of the King's infirmity
and his control of the boy.
God help us then
if the King should die.
But I have heard many say
that the people would rather
see you anointed as Queen
than...
leave the country
at the mercy of a mere child
and an overweening uncle.
And what of the Queen?
You shall hear more
on that subject...
very soon.
The King!
Admiral.
We are very pleased
to make a new treaty with France.
I will have no further business
with the Emperor...
who has betrayed me at every turn.
You will find us good
and faithful friends...
unlike the Emperor.
As you know,
in my Kingdom I have made
many changes to religious life.
I have reformed a corrupt church.
I have swept aside hundreds of years
of lies and superstitions.
I have revealed to all mankind
that the Pope
is but a fallible prince,
and not the voice of God.
All this, no doubt,
you'll have heard.
I am certainly aware
that Your Majesty has wrought
many changes in your own Kingdom.
Well, if we are going
to be allies, Monsieur,
then I propose a further change.
I propose that Mass be abolished
in both our realms
and replaced
with a simple communion service.
Now, how would you feel about that?
I have no authority to renegotiate
the terms of our treaty,
especially, as Your Majesty knows,
my King is dying.
Of syphilis, I know.
I am very sorry to hear it.
I have known Francis a long time,
and I beg you to send him my love.
But you may also tell him
that his disease is a reminder
of his own mortality!
Which, in times past,
he has forgotten!
I have something for you
to show the Queen.
I'm supposed to take it
to Lord Risley.
When the Queen's read it,
give it back to me.
... so handsome.
Oh, hush, sister.
What is it?
Oh my God.
What is that?
Who is it?
It's the Queen's Majesty,
Your Majesty.
Why is she screaming like that?
I'll go and see her.
What is it?
I...
I fear...
you have grown displeased with me.
Why so?
Because...
I fear that you have
utterly forsaken me.
I don't understand.
What has caused you to think so?
Why would I have reason
to be displeased with you?
Are you not
displeased with me?
I will ask you one more time:
is there any reason I should be?
There is none, Your Majesty.
Good day, My Lady.
Sister!
Ladies!
Now, you must do as I ask.
Clear your coffers of all books
whether you suppose them
to be forbidden or not!
From now on we shall talk
no more, amongst ourselves,
of any matters, whether religious
or controversial,
and I shall try, in all things,
to conform myself
to the King's mind.
Now go.
Hurry!
Good day.
May I be presented to His Grace?
Alas, my Lord,
His Grace is indisposed.
He caught a chill and is still abed.
I am very sorry to hear it.
I will return some other time,
when the Duke is well.
No, no, my Lord.
I am...
well enough to see you.
I think your faction is engaged
in a fight to the death
with Bishop Gardiner and his.
I will not hide the truth from you.
The King's infirmity
and the youth of my nephew
make the question
of succession urgent.
The stakes could not possibly
be higher.
And you desire to know, I assume,
on which side of the argument
I belong?
Your Grace,
whether you will it or not,
you carry a great weight of confidence
and influence with the King.
And everyone knows that.
But fewer people know
that your wife, the Duchess,
and my wife Anne,
together with the Queen,
are as close on matters of religion
as it is possible to be.
And this close affinity has
emboldened me, now,
to approach Your Grace.
Surely your wife has told you
that the Duchess
and I are estranged!
Thus her affinities
are not necessarily my own
and you do me a disservice
to assume they are.
Your Grace, forgive me...
I do forgive you.
I forgive you
even for hounding poor,
proud Surrey to his death...
for it was his fault.
But as to religion.
I have never read the Gospels,
and never shall.
I am sure they enlighten you,
but I prefer them to remain mysterious.
And, as for the promise
of a better world,
I can only say that England
was merry before,
and all things considered,
I would all things
were as they used to be
in times past.
Your Grace, if I do not have
your support,
may I ask if you will act
against me?
I'm not sure if this is any answer,
My Lord Hertford.
I have always been drawn to a phrase
used by the French peasants:
"Praise the God of all,
"drink the wine,
and let the world be the world."
My Lady Hertford.
I was summoned here
but I have no idea why.
I wonder how I may help you?
You may help me, My Lady,
by telling me the truth.
You were a friend, I believe,
of the heretic Anne Askew,
recently burned?
I was acquainted with her.
You were more than acquainted,
I think.
While she was a prisoner,
one of your servant,
a man wearing a blue coat...
gave her money.
I desired to make her
circumstances more tolerable.
I was only acting
out of Christian charity.
I had been informed
that those who tortured her,
illegally, had stretched
her on the rack
until the strings of her arms
and legs were perished.
But you admit
she was a self-confessed heretic?
You are therefore guilty
by association.
You have a warrant for my arrest?
You will never serve that warrant.
Why not?
Because I know your secret.
What secret, My Lady Hertford?
You are not such a saint
as you appear are you, Your Grace?
You have not exactly
renounced worldly goods...
have you?
There are two monasteries
in Cornwall.
They were stripped and closed,
on His Majesty's orders, and burnt.
Except...
that they were neither stripped
nor burnt,
but their titles and contents
were transferred to Your Grace.
Thus, you are a rich man indeed...
but only by embezzling
from the King.
I advise you
to tear up your warrant,
Her Majesty the Queen.
Come in here.
I am glad you have come.
You can resolve
me of certain doubts.
I wonder, Kate,
how much you think you can learn
from reading the Gospels
and other religious books?
Since God has appointed you
as Supreme Head of us all,
it is from you
that I will ever learn.
But that surely is not so!
You have become a doctor, Kate,
to instruct us, as we have seen
many times before...
but not to be instructed
or directed by us!
Majesty, I think my meaning
has been mistaken
for I have always
held it preposterous
- for a woman to instruct her Lord.
- And yet,
you seem sometimes
to have a different view
of religion than we do.
Only so that you could correct me!
Forgive me, Your Majesty,
but I thought that talking
and discussing
helped to ease the pain and weariness
of your present infirmity.
And it encouraged me in my boldness,
in the hope of profiting
from your learned discourse.
I am,
I am but a woman,
with all the imperfections natural
to the weakness of my sex,
and therefore,
in all matters of doubt and difficulty
I must refer myself
to Your Majesty's better judgment,
as my Lord and head.
Is that so, sweetheart?
And you made your argument
for no worse ends?
Then we are perfect friends again.
I thank Your Majesty.
I promise
that I will never doubt you again.
Sweet Kate.
Shall I rescind Your Majesty's order
to arrest the Queen tomorrow?
Why?
Music.
What is it, sweetheart?
Nothing.
I was dreaming.
We were back in Boulogne...
but I let you go.
I'm here.
- Has the dawn come yet?
- Not yet. Not yet.
I hate the nights.
- I think of perpetual night.
- Hush, darling.
The dawn will be here soon,
and you well again.
Yes, my darling?
I'm so happy.
What is this?
Lord Chancellor!
Why have you come?
I have come to execute
the warrant for the Queen's arrest
and to escort her,
and her Ladies, to the Tower.
You knave!
You arrant knave!
Get out! Get out of my sight!
- Majesty...
- Get out!
And take your bastards with you.
I am so...
sorry that...
the Lord Chancellor should
make such a mistake.
You don't how little
he deserves your sympathy.
He was not your friend, Kate.
- Lord Hertford!
- My Lord Hertford!
Your Grace,
I have already explained,
he called me a knave!
All manner of things.
But for whose ears?
Supposing he still wants the Queen
to feel falsely secure?
If it was feigned anger,
it seemed very real to me!
My Lords, in the King's absence,
Council is called upon
to declare its content
with the terms of the peace treaty
with France.
All in favour say "aye"
Aye.
Council is also called upon
to discuss all arrangements made
for the security and safety
of His Highness Prince Edward,
heir to the throne,
and all provisions made
for his temporal
and spiritual welfare.
My Lords, pray,
what induces you to discuss
such things now,
when all provisions are already made
and the Prince is secure at Windsor,
by His Majesty's orders?
Aye.
My Lord Hertford,
Council is still constituted
to examine such matters,
especially since
the King's infirmities
give us all cause
to think of the future.
And it is treason,
my Lord Chancellor,
to envisage the King's death!
My Lord, all our concern
is for the Prince.
Your concern?!
Are you forgetting
that he is of my blood?
He is also of the King's blood,
which gives us cause enough
to examine those put in charge of him.
And among them, some of whom
we find, like his tutors,
to be suspected heretics!
You talk of heresy! You!
And what are you but a puffed-up
porkling of the Pope's?
My Lord!
I still say, my Lord Hertford...
that the real truth behind
your intentions
towards the Prince and the Crown
must be placed before the King.
- What are you doing?
- Take your hands off!
Bishop Gardiner desires
an audience with your Majesty.
Refused.
His Grace has a troublesome nature
and I don't want to see him here
ever again.
I desire him to leave my Court.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Grace, His Majesty
instructs you to leave Court.
- My Lord Hertford.
- Lord Hertford.
Lord Chancellor.
What may I do for you?
You may forgive me,
if you find it possible to do so,
from some past associations,
which I now regret.
I have no hesitation in pledging my
utter loyalty to Your Lordship's House,
and I trust in future
I can serve you
as faithfully as I have
always served His Majesty.
I am most grateful to you,
my Lord Chancellor.
Mr. Holbein.
- Mr. Holbein.
- Majesty.
I have a commission for you.
I am most grateful to Your Majesty.
I assume Your Majesty
means a portrait?
You once painted my father.
Now you will paint me.
I am deeply honored.
Sweetheart,
sweetheart,
here is a messenger
from His Majesty.
Your Grace,
His Majesty has heard
of your indisposition
and has asked to see you.
No!
That is impossible,
ask the physicians.
What shall I tell His Majesty?
Tell him...
I shall come.
But you can't!
How can I lie in bed, my love,
when the King of England
has summoned me?
Just get them to help me.
What are you doing here?
I have come to see my daughter.
Why should that surprise you, Henry?
You have not always
been kind to her.
I have wept so often
to see her alone,
abandoned by her father.
Is that why you've come back,
to chide me
for all that I am not?
She ought to be a long time
married by now.
She ought to have her own children.
Go away,
shade.
Go away, Katherine.
You sent me away before...
though I loved you.
But I was still your wife
in God's eyes.
And still am.
His Grace the Duke of Suffolk.
Charles.
Majesty.
They told me you were ill.
So I had to see you.
I have a slight fever.
Perhaps Your Majesty should
not come so close.
We've known each other a long time,
a very long time.
And I remember everything.
In fact,
I remember things from long ago
better than I remember yesterday.
I remember Your Majesty's
sister so well.
And the Battle of the Spurs!
And when Your Majesty
made me a Duke...
God knows why!
You were my general,
in York and in France,
because I could trust no one else.
And I beg you now Charles,
to trust me.
I have the power
to make you well again,
you know that.
They told me you were like to die...
but you won't die.
I forbid it!
Kneel.
By the grace of God,
I, the Eighth Henry,
King of England,
Ireland, and France,
Defender of the Faith
and of the Church of England
command you to be healed!
My Lady Suffolk.
Your Grace.
May I say, on behalf of all
His Grace's loyal servants and staff,
that we are as heart-broken
and wretched
as Your Grace must be
on this unhappy day.
For we all loved His Grace
as much as you, his wife,
and son, loved him.
Thank you.
Your sympathy and loyalty
touch my son and I most deeply.
Madame.
<i>Requiescant in pace Domini.</i>
<i>Et Lux perpetua luceat eis.</i>
<i>Requiescant in pace.</i>
He is to be buried
at St George's Chapel at Windsor.
At my expense.
I tell you this, my Lord Hertford:
as long as Charles Brandon
served me,
he never betrayed a friend,
nor ever took unfair advantage
of an enemy.
Which is more than I can say
for anyone else at my Court!
I never thought he would die.
We should talk, my Lord Hertford,
about the arrangements
for the Prince's minority
after I am dead!
Mr. Holbein is here.
Mr. Holbein.
With your permission, I came
to show you my work in progress.
Master Holbein.
When you painted my father,
you made his likeness
when he was old, sickly, and ill.
He looked nothing
like a King of England,
more like a poor wretch!
A feeble, plain, and dying man.
And now you have done
the same for me!
Mr. Holbein, this portrait is a lie!
Do it again!
And get out.
Why are you here?
To see my daughter.
She was the only pure
thing in my life.
And in my life I neglected her,
since she was only a girl,
and I wanted so much to give you a son.
But now I am so proud of her.
Fiercely proud!
She is so clever.
And though she is like me
in so many ways,
she is not intemperate as I was.
You must be proud of her too, Henry.
I am.
I am very proud of her.
And I know how clever she is.
And I wish
that I could love her more.
But from time to time
she reminds me of you...
and of what you did to me.
I did nothing to you.
I was innocent.
All the accusations
against me were false.
I thought you knew.
Poor Katherine Howard.
She lies in the cold
ground next to me.
Poor child.
It was not her fault either.
But we were like two moths,
drawn to the flame...
and burned.
Anne, please don't!
His Majesty, the King.
Lady Mary...
Lady Elizabeth...
Kate...
Come here!
I have decided
to send you away to Greenwich.
I will not spend Christmastide
with you this year,
or thereafter.
- Why, Your Majesty?
- Kate,
do not question my command.
It is as it is.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Mary.
You must be a kind
and loving mother to your brother,
who I leave in this world
a helpless little child.
Please, father, I beg you,
do not leave me an orphan so soon!
Mary,
Mary.
Elizabeth.
You are so very young,
but you, too
can look after your brother.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I promise.
Bless you, child.
Bless you.
The time has come
for us to bid farewell.
It is God's will.
When I die,
I order these gentlemen to treat you
as if I were living still.
And if it is your pleasure
to remarry,
I order that you shall
have 7,000 pounds a year
as long as you live
for your service,
as well as your jewels
and ornaments.
Now go.
How is my son?
Jane!
He is well.
I have taken all care of him...
sweet Jane.
And soon, he will be King.
My poor boy.
My poor child.
No!
He is the most beloved.
He is my special boy.
He will die young.
No! No!
Poor child,
you expected too much of him!
He was only a boy!
Kings, too, are made of clay!
And God forbid you locked him away
from the world,
like your father did with you.
No!
Don't you understand?
You have killed him!
No!
Herewith, my Lords, is my testament.
When I am dead,
my Lord Hertford
will act as Lord Protector
during Prince Edward's minority.
He will be supported
by my Lord Chancellor Risley
and Archbishop Cranmer.
It is my desire
to be buried next to the body
of my true and loving wife,
Queen Jane Seymour, at Windsor.
You shall raise an honorable tomb,
upon which will be our effigies,
fashioned as if we are
sweetly sleeping.
Mr. Holbein awaits you
in the Chapel.
Master Holbein,
it is well done.
Merci d'avoir suivi "The Tudors"

<i>THE TUDORS
Saison 1 - Épisode 1</i>
<i>Palais Ducal
Urbino, Italie</i>
Monsieur l'ambassadeur.
C'est extręmement humiliant,
signore Bedoli.
S'il vous plaît Excellence,
s'il vous plaît.
Qu'est-ce qui peut ętre si important pour
que vous me leviez avant 7h ?
Le Duc a organisé une réunion avancée du
conseil et veut que vous y participiez.
Monsieur.
Que les Français font-ils lŕ ?
C'est ce pourquoi
Sa Grâce veut vous parler.
Mon Excellence...
Bâtards de Français....
Bâtards.
<i>Palais Whitehall
Londres</i>
Monsieur Pace.
Monsieur More.
Sa Majesté veut que le conseil
de cet aprčs-midi soit bref.
Il ne veut pas trop de discours.
Oů est le roi ?
Il s'est isolé et
ne veut pas ętre dérangé.
Comment va-t-il ?
- Ŕ quel sujet...
- Au sujet de l'Italie.
Que font les Français en Italie ?
Quel autre sujet y a-t-il ?
Sa Majesté conseille d'ętre patient.
Oui, mais vous ętes son secrétaire...
Vous le voyez tous les jours.
En privé, il est fou de chagrin,
presque inconsolable
Vous devriez vous rappeler que
c'est son oncle qu'ils ont assassiné.
<i>Le Roi</i>
<i>Milords</i>
Nous nous réunissons pour débattre
d'une question cruciale
Le roi de France a démontré au monde
entier, l'agressivité de sa politique.
Il a déjŕ envahi 5 ou 6 cités en Italie.
C'est un traître pour
toute nation chrétienne d'Europe.
Il a trompé le pape afin
qu'il le déclare défenseur de la foi.
En plus de cela, pour prouver que
personne ne peut l'atteindre,
Il a convoqué
notre ambassadeur ŕ Urbino,
et mon oncle...
... a été tué de sang-froid.
Mes lords.
Je crois que ce sont de
justes causes pour la guerre.
Sa Majesté a certainement raison.
Nous avons les raisons
de déclarer la guerre.
En effet, je vous ai averti l'année
passée des ambitions françaises,
męme s'il a fallu
une tragédie personnelle
pour que Votre Majesté m'écoute.
Norfolk.
Je suis d'accord avec lord Buckingham
Le roi d'Angleterre a un ancien et
historique droit sur le trône de France,
que Le Valois a usurpé.
Il est temps de les en déloger.
Nous frapperons la France
de toute notre force.
Qu'en dites-vous Wolsey ?
Je peux comprendre Votre Majesté,
ce sont, en effet, de justes raisons.
Bien.
C'est donc réglé.
Nous entrerons en guerre
contre la France.
Votre éminence établira
tout les arrangements.
Maintenant....
... je vais m'amuser.
Croyez-vous, vraiment, que
nous devons aller ŕ la guerre ?
Je pense qu'on devrait
faire ce que le roi veut.
Que se passera-t-il si le roi ne sait
pas le mieux pour lui ?
Alors, nous devrons l'aider ŕ décider.
Comment va votre mari ?
Mon mari....
est extręmement jaloux.
Il menace de faire un scandale.
Il dit qu'il va me mettre
dans un couvent.
Ce serait une énorme perte.
<i>Hampton Court, Surrey</i>
<i>Son Excellence l'ambassadeur de France
et l'évęque Bonnivet</i>
Messieurs, bienvenus.
Votre Excellence...
Ce qui c'est passé ŕ Urbino,
le meurtre de notre ambassadeur était...
trčs malheureux,
spécialement pour moi.
Votre Excellence connaît la profondeur
de mon amour pour votre pays.
Je me suis battu constamment
pour les intéręts français.
Mais comment expliquer cela ?
Le meurtre de l'oncle de notre roi.
Franchement, ça n'a pas été fait
sur ordre de mon maître.
Et une fois accompli,
le crime a été puni.
Vous devez comprendre,
nous sommes sűrs de cela.
Le roi Henri est jeune,
il a un attrait pour la guerre
et dans cette situation,
il sera difficile ŕ apaiser.
Alors, dans ce cas,
entrons en guerre.
Avec tout mon respect,
vous ne savez pas ce que vous dites.
Je crois que tout ce qui est
humainement possible sera fait
pour éviter la guerre
entre nos deux pays.
Il ne sera pas bon pour l'Angleterre
de s'engouffrer
dans les disputes européennes.
Il vaut mieux s'en éloigner.
Je suis sűr que Votre Éminence
a des moyens de pacifier le jeune lion.
<i>- Allez-y !
- 15-0</i>
<i>30-0 !</i>
Encore une fois, mon ami Anthony.
Votre Majesté sait
qu'on le laisse gagner.
En réalité, je joue
aussi fort que je peux.
En voila un qui a besoin de traiter.
Voyez-vous,
dans le milieu de la galerie,
ce visage angélique et exquis,
habillé de bleu ?
Qui est-elle ?
<i>40-0 !</i>
C'est la fille du duc de Buckingham.
100 couronnes
si vous couchez avec elle !
Tenu !
- Comment va notre fille ?
- Elle va bien.
Vous savez,
son tuteur dit qu'elle a
des talents exceptionnels,
surtout en musique.
Vous devriez en ętre fier.
Je le suis.
Vous savez que je le suis, Catherine.
Marie est la perle de ma vie.
Vous n'avez pas répondu
au courrier de mon neveu.
Ce n'est pas parce que
votre neveu est le roi d'Espagne
que je n'ai rien de mieux ŕ faire.
Vous savez qu'en signant ce traité
avec l'empereur,
vous ferez de la France
un ennemi commun.
Il vous conseille aussi de ne pas
écouter tout ce que Wolsey vous dit.
Car Wolsey est un ami de la France.
Depuis quand ętes-vous diplomate ?
Je tiens cela de mon pčre.
Vous ętes ma femme.
Vous n'ętes pas mon ministre.
Vous n'ętes pas mon chancelier.
Mais ma femme.
J'aimerais ętre votre femme
dans toutes les situations.
Henri, vous ne visitez plus
ma couche comme avant.
Mangez.
Allons-y.
Votre Majesté.
Oů est la reine Catherine ?
Sa Majesté prie encore,
Votre Majesté.
Dites ŕ Sa Majesté,
que je suis venu lui offrir amour
et dévotion, comme un vrai mari.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Votre Majesté...
Consentez-vous ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
<i>3 points.
Baron of Fortland</i>
<i>Monsieur Charles Brandon
entre maintenant en lice.</i>
Vos Majestés.
Milady Buckingham,
me ferait-elle l'honneur de me laisser
utiliser ses faveurs, aujourd'hui ?
<i>Lord Hallum se présente
pour une joute.</i>
<i>2 points,
pour M. Charles Brandon.</i>
<i>Sa Grâce, le Duc de Buckingham,
défie ŕ la joute le comte de Newcastle.</i>
<i>Atteint.</i>
<i>Un troisičme point,
pour Sa Grâce.</i>
Votre Éminence a-t-elle un plan ?
Une solution pour éviter la guerre.
Ceci est la base
d'un nouveau traité de paix,
unissant les Anglais aux Français.
- Puis-je...
- Non.
Je veux que vous le preniez
et le lisiez soigneusement.
Je crois qu'il représente
quelque chose de nouveau en diplomatie.
Si votre roi en accepte les principes,
il peut le signer
sans perdre la face.
Il pourra alors se réjouir.
Mon maître pourra se réjouir.
Nous pourrons tous nous réjouir.
Et dans ce cas, que demande,
votre Éminence, en échange ?
- Rien...
- Rien ?
Rien de vous...
Ce que je veux, Votre Grâce,
il n'ya que vous
qui puissiez me le donner.
<i>Le duc de Buckingham
entre en lice.</i>
Il a déjŕ gagné 10 joutes,
que veut-il prouver ?
- J'y vais.
- Non, je le ferais.
J'aimerais blesser
la fierté de Buckingham.
<i>Mes lords...</i>
<i>Le roi entre dans le champ.</i>
<i>Sa Majesté lance un défi
"ŕ la guerre."</i>
Et ça recommence !
Qu'il le veuille ou non,
Buckingham n'est pas le roi.
Toute la cour n'est pas
aussi loyale que vous, Charles.
Milady !
<i>Atteint !</i>
<i>Sa Majesté gagne le jeu.</i>
Le roi !
<i>Et doucement !</i>
<i>Réunissez les avirons !</i>
- Thomas.
- Votre Majesté.
Ceci est ma famille.
Votre Majesté.
Mon épouse, Alice.
Alice, embrasse le roi.
Votre Majesté.
Longeons la rivičre, Thomas.
J'aime marcher.
Pourquoi ne venez-vous
pas vivre ŕ la cour ?
Vous savez parfaitement pourquoi,
ça ne me plaît pas.
Ma pratique légale
et ma vie sont ici.
La Cour est faite pour
des hommes plus ambitieux.
Vous n'avez pas beaucoup parlé
hier soir au conseil.
Ŕ quel propos ?
Partir en guerre contre la France.
Comme humaniste,
j'ai une haine de la guerre.
C'est une activité faite seulement
pour les animaux...
Mais aucun d'eux ne la pratique d'une
maničre aussi constante que l'homme.
Comme humaniste,
je comprends votre opinion,
comme roi,
je suis forcé de la désapprouver.
Vous parlez comme un avocat !
- C'est vous qui me l'avez appris.
- Pas assez ŕ ce que je vois
- Avez-vous fini ?
- Oui.
Henri, je vous recommande...
Au lieu de dépenser d'énormes
quantités d'argent pour la guerre,
vous devriez le dépenser pour
le bien-ętre de vos sujets.
Thomas, je vous promets...
J'essaye d'ętre un dirigeant juste.
Dites-moi,
pourquoi Henry V est reconnu ?
Parce qu'il s'est doté d'universités ?
Qu'il a bâti des refuges
pour les pauvres ?
Non, il est reconnu car
il a gagné la bataille d'Agincourt.
3000 archers anglais
contre 60.000 Français.
Le fleuron de la cavalerie
française, détruit en 4 heures.
Cette victoire l'a rendu
célčbre Thomas.
Elle l'a rendu immortel.
Il n'a pas droit ŕ tout cela.
Son pčre s'est emparé de la couronne
sur le champ de bataille,
il n'avait aucune légitimité, ŕ part
depuis un bâtard du côté maternel.
La famille de Votre Grâce
est plus légitime, il est vrai.
Je suis le descendant direct
d'Édouard II.
C'est ma couronne, et ma cour.
Et non pas sa couronne ou sa cour.
C'est une trahison, Votre Grâce.
C'est "LA" vérité.
Et un jour, nous la
ferons devenir réelle.
- Votre Grâce.
- Milord.
Qu'est-ce cela ?
Brandon...
Exactement ce dont
ça a l'air... Votre Grâce.
Vous avez violé ma fille.
Non non, elle m'a supplié.
Vous avez pris son honneur.
Je vous jure Votre Grâce, quelqu'un
d'autre est passé par lŕ avant moi.
Fils de pute.
Oui, ça c'est vrai, Votre Grâce.
Je devrais vous tuer pour ça.
Foutez le camp.
Éminence, Lady Blunt est ici.
Trčs bien.
Votre Éminence.
Que puis-je faire
pour vous, Lady Blunt ?
Je... porte un enfant,
Votre Éminence.
Oui.
C'est l'enfant de Sa Majesté.
- En ętes-vous certaine ?
- Oui.
- L'avez-vous dit au roi ?
- Non.
Bien.
J'informerais le roi en temps voulu.
En attendant, ne le dites ŕ personne,
sous peine de mort. Comprenez-vous ?
Quand vous ne serez plus apte
ŕ cacher votre condition,
vous serez... Transférée
vers un endroit discret,
pour que vous vous reposiez.
Vous pourrez alors donner
naissance ŕ votre bâtard.
Merci, Votre Éminence.
Mes lords et maîtres,
faites place ŕ Notre Grâce.
Faites place, reculez,
revenez plus tard...
- Votre Éminence !
- Ah, Monsieur Pace.
J'ai confiance en vous pour
surveiller mes intéręts.
Certainement, Votre Éminence.
Comme un aigle.
Je ne veux pas d'aigle,
Monsieur Pace.
Ils volent trop haut.
Soyez un pigeon.
- Ils chient sur tout le monde.
- Oui.
Oh, mon Dieu.
- Oů est le roi ?
- Parti chasser.
Bien, ça me maintient
de bonne humeur.
- Prévenez-moi quand il sera revenu.
- Oui, Votre Éminence.
Qui ętes-vous ?
Que voulez-vous ?
J'ai une lettre d'introduction,
Monsieur.
Elle provient du doyen
de la cathédrale de Canterbury.
Oui, monsieur.
Pourquoi
ne vous ętes-vous pas présenté ?
- Thomas Tallis !
- Oui, monsieur.
Il dit que vous jouez
de l'orgue et de la flűte,
et que vous chantez mieux
que moyennement bien.
- Autre chose ?
- Oui, monsieur.
Je compose un peu.
Sűrement.
Bien. Puisque le doyen
recommande vos talents,
nous verrons cela,
n'est-ce pas ?
Thomas.
Votre Majesté a apprécié
sa partie de chasse, aujourd'hui ?
Comment vont les préparatifs ?
Trčs bien, l'armée et la marine
ont rassemblé
les stocks de matériel et de provisions,
vous pourrez partir ŕ la guerre,
dans quelques semaines.
Excellent. Je savais que
je pouvais vous faire confiance.
Je vous remercie, Votre Majesté.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Votre Majesté, les guerres coűtent cher.
Pour les payer,
vous devrez augmenter les taxes,
et ce n'est pas toujours populaire.
Peut-ętre que Votre Majesté
pourrait gagner plus de prestige
par d'autres moyens ?
D'autres moyens ?
Des moyens pacifiques.
Quoi ? Pas de batailles ?
Pas de gloire ?
Je pense que Votre Majesté
devrait l'écouter.
Ces derničres semaines, j'ai mené,
au nom de Votre Majesté,
d'intensives rencontres diplomatiques,
non seulement avec
l'ambassadeur de France,
mais également avec
les représentants de l'Empereur,
avec des envoyés du Danemark,
du Portugal, d'Italie et d'autres.
Dans quel but ?
Établir un traité.
Quel genre de traité ?
Un traité de paix
universelle et perpétuelle.
- Et comment cela pourrait-il se faire ?
- En plusieurs étapes.
En premier, il y aura un sommet
entre le roi de France et d'Angleterre.
Pendant ce sommet,
la fille de votre Majesté
sera officiellement
présentée au Dauphin.
Et ŕ la fin de ce sommet,
vous signerez conjointement le traité.
Ce traité est un fait nouveau
dans l'histoire de l'Europe,
associant tous les signataires,
aux principes de...
sécurité mutuelle et paix universelle.
Comment serait-il appliqué ?
Si l'un des pays signataires
souffre d'une agression,
tous les autres demanderont
la fin de l'agression,
s'ils ne l'obtiennent pas,
aprčs un mois,
ils déclareront la guerre,
jusqu'ŕ restauration de la paix.
Le traité envisage aussi la constitution
d'une institution paneuropéenne.
Dans un certain sens,
cela me plaît, je le reconnais.
- Tout comme vous Thomas.
- En effet !
C'est l'application des principes
humanistes aux relations internationales.
Votre Éminence doit ętre félicitée.
Je ne cherche pas d'éloges.
Sa Majesté sera connue comme l'architecte
d'un monde nouveau et moderne.
Ça serait... une récompense suffisante.
Soyez, toujours assuré
de notre amour.
Bonne nuit Messieurs.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Votre Majesté, le Duc de Buckingham
insiste pour une audience.
Votre Grâce.
Votre Majesté doit ętre avertie
que j'ai découvert M. Charles Brandon
en flagrant délit avec ma fille.
M. Brandon a apporté la honte
sur ma famille.
Je demande que Sa Majesté
le bannisse de la cour,
ainsi que tout autre châtiment
que Sa Majesté jugera approprié.
Il n'y aura pas de punition.
Ŕ moins que votre fille
n'accuse M. Brandon de viol !
Est-ce ce qu'elle dit ?
Votre fille a-t-elle accusé
M. Brandon de viol ?
Elle n'en a point besoin,
l'offense est contre moi et ma famille.
Dans ce cas,
il n'y a pas eu d'offense,
et il n'y a nul besoin de punition.
Votre Majesté.
Votre Grâce.
Méfiez-vous de Buckingham, Henry.
Il est peut-ętre stupide,
mais il a plus d'argent que vous,
et il peut se constituer
une armée privée.
Męme votre pčre ne lui tenait pas tęte.
Je suis trčs heureux que le Roi
de France consente ŕ signer le traité
et ŕ ętre l'hôte du sommet.
Sa Majesté a été charmée par le fait
qu'il n'y ait pas de guerre.
Comme nous tous.
Ŕ propos des autres choses
dont on avait parlé.
Quelles autres choses, Votre Éminence ?
J'ai sauvé le cul de votre maître,
je veux ma rémunération.
Et vous pouvez m'arranger ça.
Vous comprenez ?
Pauvre de vous.
Bien, oů en étions-nous quand
nous avons été brutalement interrompus ?
Charles, on devrait arręter...
Mon pčre vous tuera.
Alors, je mourrais
comme un homme heureux.
Bien, avez-vous tous
fini votre lecture ?
Oui, pčre.
Trčs bien.
Que Dieu et ses anges vous bénissent
et vous protčgent cette nuit...
... et toujours.
Bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit, les enfants.
<i>La lettre au Roi de France,
Votre Majesté ?</i>
"Mon royal cousin préféré". Non...
Écrivez plutôt "Mon cousin adoré".
Nous vous envoyons notre amour.
Nous vous aimons tellement, qu'il serait
impossible de vous aimer plus.
Prenez toutes les dispositions
pour que l'on se voie face ŕ face.
Rien n'est maintenant plus désiré
et plus chéri par mon cśur que...
... ce traité de paix universelle.
Comme preuve de ma bonne volonté,
de mon engagement ŕ cet accord et...
... de mon amour pour Votre Majesté,
j'ai décidé...
j'ai décidé...
Oui, Votre Majesté ?
J'ai décidé de ne plus me raser
jusqu'ŕ notre rencontre.
Ma barbe sera un signe
d'amitié universelle,
de l'amour que l'on partage.
- Votre Éminence.
- Votre Grâce.
J'ai des nouvelles pour Votre Éminence.
Sa Sainteté, le pape Alexandre,
est désespérément malade.
Il ne faudra pas longtemps avant
qu'il ne rejoigne la maison du Seigneur.
Considérant la piété, trčs connue,
de Votre Éminence,
ainsi que vos compétences
d'enseignement et de diplomatie,
je peux assurer ŕ Votre Éminence
l'appui des cardinaux français
présents en conclave
pour choisir un successeur.
Avec le vote de vos propres
cardinaux, et s'il plaît ŕ Dieu...
Vous serez élu Pape, évęque de Rome.
Un nouveau Saint-Pčre.
Merci, Votre Grâce.
Je me sens...
... vraiment humble.
Ętes-vous malade, Lady Blunt ?
Non, Votre Majesté.
Restez, s'il vous plaît !
Merci, bonne nuit.
On ne s'est pas parlé
depuis longtemps.
Le cardinal Wolsey a renvoyé
mon confesseur espagnol et...
... la majorité de mes courtisanes
espagnoles, par peur des espions.
Je ne peux pas avoir confiance
en mon confesseur anglais,
mais je peux avoir confiance en vous.
Puis-je, Lady Blunt ?
Oui, Madame.
Quelle est ma tristesse ?
C'est un nśud.
Je ne peux donner au roi un fils vivant.
J'ai donné naissance
ŕ un garçon, une fois.
Un adorable garçon.
Mais il est mort, dans mes bras,
aprčs seulement
4 semaines d'existence.
Le roi m'a blâmée, je sais qu'il croit
que c'est entičrement de ma faute.
Il ignore combien j'ai souffert,
combien j'ai prié.
Je pensais ŕ mon frčre, Arthur.
Ŕ sa mort... Il a été décidé
que j'épouserais Catherine.
Je crois que mon pčre
n'a pas voulu perdre son autorité.
Ou bien le prestige
d'un mariage espagnol.
Dans tous les cas...
Catherine jura que le mariage
n'avait jamais été consommé.
Grâce ŕ cela, la dispense
papale a été octroyée...
... et je l'ai épousée.
Et depuis, nous avons
eu cinq mort-nés.
Un garçon,
qui n'a vécu que 26 jours.
Et une seule fille vivante.
Et si cette union avait
été consommée ?
Elle a juré, devant Dieu,
que ce n'était pas le cas.
Que disent les évangiles ?
D'un homme qui a épousé
la femme de son frčre ?
Dites-moi.
Dans le Lévitique,
il est dit que si un homme
épouse la femme de son frčre...
... il mourra sans descendance.
Mais, vous avez un enfant.
Mais pas de fils !
Je n'ai pas de fils !
Thomas Boleyn, Votre Grâce.
Thomas, j'espčre que vous n'avez pas
trouvé mon invitation présomptueuse.
J'ai ouď dire que vous aviez
été rappelé de France.
Je suis ici pour peu de temps,
Votre Grâce.
Venez.
On m'a dit que vous ętes
un excellent ambassadeur.
Alors, quels qu'ils soient,
ils sont vraiment aimables.
Vous ętes issu d'une ancienne famille.
Pas aussi ancienne, ni grande,
que celle de Votre Grâce.
Le roi aime s'entourer
de gens communs.
Des gens sans distinctions,
sans pedigree ni titres...
Comment cela aide-t-il
au prestige de la Couronne ?
- Votre Grâce...
- Il régit la cour par la force,
non par le droit.
Votre Grâce, nul ne veut revenir
aux terribles jours de la guerre civile.
Ce qui est fait, est fait !
Le roi est le roi !
Le roi est le roi.
Wolsey.
Un homme d'Église
avec une maîtresse et deux enfants ?
Cela vous plaît-il ?
Pas du tout.
Nous devrons en reparler.
Parlez-moi du roi de France,
Monsieur Thomas.
- Il a 23 ans.
- Est-il grand ?
Oui.
Mais mal proportionné.
Et ses jambes ?
Sont-elles fortes, comme les miennes ?
Majesté, personne n'a
de jambes comme les vôtres.
Est-il beau ?
Quelques personnes pourraient le penser.
Et il doit le croire, lui aussi.
Il est vaniteux ?
Votre Majesté... c'est un français.
Qu'en est-il de sa cour ?
Elle a une réputation de petite morale,
et d'ętre licencieuse.
Et le roi, par sa propre conduite,
n'a rien ŕ lui envier.
Vous avez deux filles, Sir Thomas.
Comment les protégez-vous ?
Je les garde sous surveillance...
Et j'ai confiance en
leur bonté et leur vertu.
Vous repartirez immédiatement ŕ Paris.
Je vous confie toutes les négociations
diplomatiques pour le sommet.
Échec et mat.
Votre Majesté...
Marie !
Papa !
N'ętes-vous pas la plus belle ?
N'ętes-vous pas
la plus belle fille au monde ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Oui, vous l'ętes.
Comment vous sentez-vous ?
- Bien.
- Bien ?
Papa est occupé.
Soyez gentille
et faites tout ce qu'on vous dit.
Peut-on parler ?
Continuez.
Milady.
Votre Majesté.
Je n'aime pas cela.
Que n'aimez-vous pas ?
Votre barbe.
- Plutôt ce qu'elle représente.
- Catherine !
Vous donnez ma fille au Dauphin,
et ŕ la France, sans m'avoir consultée.
Les Valois sont les ennemis
jurés de ma famille.
C'est ŕ moi de dire
ce qui est souhaitable.
C'est un grand mariage.
Je vois la main de Wolsey derričre cela.
Je vous aime, Votre Majesté,
et vous suis loyale,
dans tout les cas.
Je ne peux cacher mon souci
et ma tristesse.
Eh bien, vous y serez obligée.
<i>Paris, France</i>
Oů sont mes filles ?
J'ai des nouvelles stupéfiantes.
Il y aura un sommet entre le roi Henri
et le roi de France, prčs de Calais.
Je dois l'organiser.
Vous aurez l'opportunité
de rencontrer le roi d'Angleterre.
Marie...
... et Anne Boleyn.
Ŕ votre futur.
Son Éminence le cardinal Wolsey.
Je voudrais votre avis.
Aimez-vous ce vętement ?
Il sied trčs bien
ŕ Votre Majesté.
Peut-ętre,
puis-je vous suggérer...
... celui-ci.
Pensez-vous que les Français
ont des choses aussi raffinées ?
S'ils en ont,
c'est qu'ils les ont volées.
Venez.
Mangeons ensemble.
Nous pourrons parler.
Attendez.
Votre Grâce va s'excuser.
J'ai dit, vous devez vous excuser.
Je m'excuse si
j'ai offensé Votre Majesté.
Votre Grâce peut se retirer.
Garçon, donne au chancelier
une nouvelle paire de chaussures.
Hopkins !
Hopkins !
Votre Grâce.
Le moment est venu.
Parlez-moi.
Bien, tout est pręt
pour le sommet.
Il aura lieu dans le Pas-de-Calais,
un territoire anglais,
dans une vallée appelée
"Le Val-doré", la vallée de l'or.
Mille ouvriers ont construit
un palais pour sa Majesté,
appelé "le Palais des Illusions".
Certains d'entre eux, disent que
c'est la huitičme merveille du monde.
Vous achčterez le plus de tissus
d'or et d'argent que tu peux trouver,
c'est la meilleure façon
de corrompre les gardiens.
Oui, Votre Grâce.
Ensuite, je veux que tu nous rejoignes
et que tu fasses ce qu'on a dit,
fais courir le bruit que nous engageons
des hommes pour nous défendre.
Oui, Votre Grâce.
Lady Blunt...
... attend un enfant.
Lady Blunt ?
Si vous voulez le garder,
je prendrais des dispositions
afin qu'il soit transporté
dans une maison ŕ Jéricho,
et je la réconcilierais avec son mari.
Mon pčre m'a raconté comment il a
planifié l'assassinat de Richard III.
Il devait l'attaquer avec un couteau
caché dans ses vętements.
Votre Majesté.
Je suis impatient d'aller au sommet.
On va changer le monde pour toujours.
C'est mon plus grand espoir,
et mon ultime croyance.
Plus rien ne sera comme avant.
Votre Éminence...
Vous et moi, nous serons immortels.

<i>THE TUDORS
Saison 1 - …pisode 1</i>
<i>Palais Ducal
Urbino, Italie</i>
Monsieur l'ambassadeur.
C'est extrÍmement humiliant,
signore Bedoli.
S'il vous plaÓt Excellence,
s'il vous plaÓt.
Qu'est-ce qui peut Ítre si important
pour que vous me leviez avant 7h†?
Le Duc a organisť une rťunion avancťe du
conseil et veut que vous y participiez.
Monsieur.
Que les FranÁais font-ils lŗ†?
C'est ce pourquoi
Sa Gr‚ce veut vous parler.
Mon Excellence...
B‚tards de FranÁais....
B‚tards.
<i>Palais Whitehall
Londres</i>
Monsieur Pace.
Monsieur More.
Sa Majestť veut que le conseil
de cet aprŤs-midi soit bref.
Il ne veut pas trop de discours.
Oý est le roi†?
Il s'est isolť et
ne veut pas Ítre dťrangť.
Comment va-t-il†?
- ņ quel sujet...
- Au sujet de l'Italie.
Que font les FranÁais en Italie†?
Quel autre sujet y a-t-il†?
Sa Majestť conseille d'Ítre patient.
Oui, mais vous Ítes son secrťtaire...
Vous le voyez tous les jours.
En privť, il est fou de chagrin,
presque inconsolable
Je pense que vous devriez vous rappeler
que c'est son oncle qu'ils ont assassinť.
<i>Le Roi</i>
<i>Milords</i>
Nous nous rťunissons pour dťbattre
d'une question cruciale
Le roi de France a dťmontrť au monde
entier, l'agressivitť de sa politique.
Il a dťjŗ envahi 5 ou 6 citťs en Italie.
C'est un traÓtre pour
toute nation chrťtienne d'Europe.
Il a trompť le pape afin
qu'il le dťclare dťfenseur de la foi.
En plus de cela, pour prouver que
personne ne peut l'atteindre,
Il a convoquť
notre ambassadeur ŗ Urbino,
et mon oncle...
... a ťtť tuť de sang-froid.
Mes lords.
Je crois que ce sont de
justes causes pour la guerre.
Sa Majestť a certainement raison.
Nous avons les raisons
de dťclarer la guerre.
En effet, je vous ai averti l'annťe
passťe des ambitions franÁaises,
mÍme s'il a fallu
une tragťdie personnelle
pour que Votre Majestť m'ťcoute.
Norfolk.
Je suis d'accord avec lord Buckingham
Le roi d'Angleterre a un ancien et
historique droit sur le trŰne de France,
que Le Valois a usurpť.
Il est temps de les en dťloger.
Nous frapperons la France
de toute notre force.
Qu'en dites-vous Wolsey†?
Je peux comprendre Votre Majestť,
ce sont, en effet, de justes raisons.
Bien.
C'est donc rťglť.
Nous entrerons en guerre
contre la France.
Votre ťminence ťtablira
tout les arrangements.
Maintenant....
... je vais m'amuser.
Croyez-vous, vraiment, que
nous devons aller ŗ la guerre†?
Je pense qu'on devrait
faire ce que le roi veut.
Que se passera-t-il si le roi ne sait
pas le mieux pour lui†?
Alors, nous devrons l'aider ŗ dťcider.
Comment va votre mari†?
Mon mari....
est extrÍmement jaloux.
Il menace de faire un scandale.
Il dit qu'il va me mettre
dans un couvent.
Ce serait une ťnorme perte.
<i>Hampton Court, Surrey</i>
<i>Son Excellence l'ambassadeur de France
et l'ťvÍque Bonnivet</i>
Messieurs, bienvenus.
Votre Excellence...
Ce qui c'est passť ŗ Urbino,
le meurtre de notre ambassadeur ťtait...
trŤs malheureux,
spťcialement pour moi.
Votre Excellence connaÓt la profondeur
de mon amour pour votre pays.
Je me suis battu constamment
pour les intťrÍts franÁais.
Mais comment expliquer cela†?
Le meurtre de l'oncle de notre roi.
Franchement, Áa n'a pas ťtť fait
sur ordre de mon maÓtre.
Et une fois accompli,
le crime a ťtť puni.
Vous devez comprendre,
nous sommes sŻrs de cela.
Le roi Henri est jeune,
il a un attrait pour la guerre
et dans cette situation,
il sera difficile ŗ apaiser.
Alors, dans ce cas,
entrons en guerre.
Avec tout mon respect,
vous ne savez pas ce que vous dites.
Je crois que tout ce qui est
humainement possible sera fait
pour ťviter la guerre
entre nos deux pays.
Il ne sera pas bon pour l'Angleterre
de s'engouffrer
dans les disputes europťennes.
Il vaut mieux s'en ťloigner.
Je suis sŻr que Votre …minence
a des moyens de pacifier le jeune lion.
<i>- Allez-y†!
- 15-0</i>
<i>30-0†!</i>
Encore une fois, mon ami Anthony.
Votre Majestť sait
qu'on le laisse gagner.
En rťalitť, je joue
aussi fort que je peux.
En voila un qui a besoin de traiter.
Voyez-vous,
dans le milieu de la galerie,
ce visage angťlique et exquis,
habillť de bleu†?
Qui est-elle†?
<i>40-0†!</i>
C'est la fille du duc de Buckingham.
100 couronnes
si vous couchez avec elle†!
Tenu†!
- Comment va notre fille†?
- Elle va bien.
Vous savez,
son tuteur dit qu'elle a
des talents exceptionnels,
surtout en musique.
Vous devriez en Ítre fier.
Je le suis.
Vous savez que je le suis, Catherine.
Marie est la perle de ma vie.
Vous n'avez pas rťpondu
au courrier de mon neveu.
Ce n'est pas parce que
votre neveu est le roi d'Espagne
que je n'ai rien de mieux ŗ faire.
Vous savez qu'en signant ce traitť
avec l'empereur,
vous ferez de la France
un ennemi commun.
Il vous conseille aussi de ne pas
ťcouter tout ce que Wolsey vous dit.
Car Wolsey est un ami de la France.
Depuis quand Ítes-vous diplomate†?
Je tiens cela de mon pŤre.
Vous Ítes ma femme.
Vous n'Ítes pas mon ministre.
Vous n'Ítes pas mon chancelier.
Mais ma femme.
J'aimerais Ítre votre femme
dans toutes les situations.
Henri, vous ne visitez plus
ma couche comme avant.
Mangez.
Allons-y.
Votre Majestť.
Oý est la reine Catherine†?
Sa Majestť prie encore,
Votre Majestť.
Dites ŗ Sa Majestť,
que je suis venu lui offrir amour
et dťvotion, comme un vrai mari.
Oui, Votre Majestť.
Votre Majestť...
Consentez-vous†?
Oui, Votre Majestť.
<i>3 points.
Baron of Fortland</i>
<i>Monsieur Charles Brandon
entre maintenant en lice.</i>
Vos Majestťs.
Milady Buckingham,
me ferait-elle l'honneur de me laisser
utiliser ses faveurs, aujourd'hui†?
<i>Lord Hallum se prťsente
pour une joute.</i>
<i>2 points,
pour M. Charles Brandon.</i>
<i>Sa Gr‚ce, le Duc de Buckingham,
dťfie ŗ la joute le comte de Newcastle.</i>
<i>Atteint.</i>
<i>Un troisiŤme point,
pour Sa Gr‚ce.</i>
Votre …minence a-t-elle un plan†?
Une solution pour ťviter la guerre.
Ceci est la base
d'un nouveau traitť de paix,
unissant les Anglais aux FranÁais.
- Puis-je...
- Non.
Je veux que vous le preniez
et le lisiez soigneusement.
Je crois qu'il reprťsente
quelque chose de nouveau en diplomatie.
Si votre roi en accepte les principes,
il peut le signer
sans perdre la face.
Il pourra alors se rťjouir.
Mon maÓtre pourra se rťjouir.
Nous pourrons tous nous rťjouir.
Et dans ce cas, que demande,
votre …minence, en ťchange†?
- Rien...
- Rien†?
Rien de vous...
Ce que je veux, Votre Gr‚ce,
il n'ya que vous
qui puissiez me le donner.
<i>Le duc de Buckingham
entre en lice.</i>
Il a dťjŗ gagnť 10 joutes,
que veut-il prouver†?
- J'y vais.
- Non, je le ferais.
J'aimerais blesser
la fiertť de Buckingham.
<i>Mes lords...</i>
<i>Le roi entre dans le champ.</i>
<i>Sa Majestť lance un dťfi
"ŗ la guerre."</i>
Et Áa recommence†!
Qu'il le veuille ou non,
Buckingham n'est pas le roi.
Toute la cour n'est pas
aussi loyale que vous, Charles.
Milady†!
<i>Atteint†!</i>
<i>Sa Majestť gagne le jeu.</i>
Le roi†!
<i>Et doucement†!</i>
<i>Rťunissez les avirons†!</i>
- Thomas.
- Votre Majestť.
Ceci est ma famille.
Votre Majestť.
Mon ťpouse, Alice.
Alice, embrasse le roi.
Votre Majestť.
Longeons la riviŤre, Thomas.
J'aime marcher.
Pourquoi ne venez-vous
pas vivre ŗ la cour†?
Vous savez parfaitement pourquoi,
Áa ne me plaÓt pas.
Ma pratique lťgale
et ma vie sont ici.
La Cour est faite pour
des hommes plus ambitieux.
Vous n'avez pas beaucoup parlť
hier soir au conseil.
ņ quel propos†?
Partir en guerre contre la France.
Comme humaniste,
j'ai une haine de la guerre.
C'est une activitť faite seulement
pour les animaux...
Mais aucun d'eux ne la pratique d'une
maniŤre aussi constante que l'homme.
Comme humaniste,
je comprends votre opinion,
comme roi,
je suis forcť de la dťsapprouver.
Vous parlez comme un avocat†!
- C'est vous qui me l'avez appris.
- Pas assez ŗ ce que je vois
- Avez-vous fini†?
- Oui.
Henri, je vous recommande...
Au lieu de dťpenser d'ťnormes
quantitťs d'argent pour la guerre,
vous devriez le dťpenser pour
le bien-Ítre de vos sujets.
Thomas, je vous promets...
J'essaye d'Ítre un dirigeant juste.
Dites-moi,
pourquoi Henry V est reconnu†?
Parce qu'il s'est dotť d'universitťs†?
Qu'il a b‚ti des refuges
pour les pauvres†?
Non, il est reconnu car
il a gagnť la bataille d'Agincourt.
3000 archers anglais
contre 60.000 FranÁais.
Le fleuron de la cavalerie
franÁaise, dťtruit en 4 heures.
Cette victoire l'a rendu
cťlŤbre Thomas.
Elle l'a rendu immortel.
Il n'a pas droit ŗ tout cela.
Son pŤre s'est emparť de la couronne
sur le champ de bataille,
il n'avait aucune lťgitimitť, ŗ part
depuis un b‚tard du cŰtť maternel.
La famille de Votre Gr‚ce
est plus lťgitime, il est vrai.
Je suis le descendant direct
d'…douard II.
C'est ma couronne, et ma cour.
Et non pas sa couronne ou sa cour.
C'est une trahison, Votre Gr‚ce.
C'est "LA" vťritť.
Et un jour, nous la
ferons devenir rťelle.
- Votre Gr‚ce.
- Milord.
Qu'est-ce cela†?
Brandon...
Exactement ce dont
Áa a l'air... Votre Gr‚ce.
Vous avez violť ma fille.
Non non, elle m'a suppliť.
Vous avez pris son honneur.
Je vous jure Votre Gr‚ce, quelqu'un
d'autre est passť par lŗ avant moi.
Fils de pute.
Oui, Áa c'est vrai, Votre Gr‚ce.
Je devrais vous tuer pour Áa.
Foutez le camp.
…minence, Lady Blunt est ici.
TrŤs bien.
Votre …minence.
Que puis-je faire
pour vous, Lady Blunt†?
Je... porte un enfant,
Votre …minence.
Oui.
C'est l'enfant de Sa Majestť.
- En Ítes-vous certaine†?
- Oui.
- L'avez-vous dit au roi†?
- Non.
Bien.
J'informerais le roi en temps voulu.
En attendant, ne le dites ŗ personne,
sous peine de mort. Comprenez-vous†?
Quand vous ne serez plus apte
ŗ cacher votre condition,
vous serez... Transfťrťe
vers un endroit discret,
pour que vous vous reposiez.
Vous pourrez alors donner
naissance ŗ votre b‚tard.
Merci, Votre …minence.
Mes lords et maÓtres,
faites place ŗ Notre Gr‚ce.
Faites place, reculez,
revenez plus tard...
- Votre …minence†!
- Ah, Monsieur Pace.
J'ai confiance en vous pour
surveiller mes intťrÍts.
Certainement, Votre …minence.
Comme un aigle.
Je ne veux pas d'aigle,
Monsieur Pace.
Ils volent trop haut.
Soyez un pigeon.
- Ils chient sur tout le monde.
- Oui.
Oh, mon Dieu.
- Oý est le roi†?
- Parti chasser.
Bien, Áa me maintient
de bonne humeur.
- Prťvenez-moi quand il sera revenu.
- Oui, Votre …minence.
Qui Ítes-vous†?
Que voulez-vous†?
J'ai une lettre d'introduction,
Monsieur.
Elle provient du doyen
de la cathťdrale de Canterbury.
Oui, monsieur.
Pourquoi
ne vous Ítes-vous pas prťsentť†?
- Thomas Tallis†!
- Oui, monsieur.
Il dit que vous jouez
de l'orgue et de la flŻte,
et que vous chantez mieux
que moyennement bien.
- Autre chose†?
- Oui, monsieur.
Je compose un peu.
SŻrement.
Bien. Puisque le doyen
recommande vos talents,
nous verrons cela,
n'est-ce pas†?
Thomas.
Votre Majestť a apprťciť
sa partie de chasse, aujourd'hui†?
Comment vont les prťparatifs†?
TrŤs bien, l'armťe et la marine
ont rassemblť
les stocks de matťriel et de provisions,
vous pourrez partir ŗ la guerre,
dans quelques semaines.
Excellent. Je savais que
je pouvais vous faire confiance.
Je vous remercie, Votre Majestť.
Qu'y a-t-il†?
Votre Majestť, les guerres coŻtent cher.
Pour les payer,
vous devrez augmenter les taxes,
et ce n'est pas toujours populaire.
Peut-Ítre que Votre Majestť
pourrait gagner plus de prestige
par d'autres moyens†?
D'autres moyens†?
Des moyens pacifiques.
Quoi†? Pas de batailles†?
Pas de gloire†?
Je pense que Votre Majestť
devrait l'ťcouter.
Ces derniŤres semaines, j'ai menť,
au nom de Votre Majestť,
d'intensives rencontres diplomatiques,
non seulement avec
l'ambassadeur de France,
mais ťgalement avec
les reprťsentants de l'Empereur,
avec des envoyťs du Danemark,
du Portugal, d'Italie et d'autres.
Dans quel but†?
…tablir un traitť.
Quel genre de traitť†?
Un traitť de paix
universelle et perpťtuelle.
- Et comment cela pourrait-il se faire†?
- En plusieurs ťtapes.
En premier, il y aura un sommet
entre le roi de France et d'Angleterre.
Pendant ce sommet,
la fille de votre Majestť
sera officiellement
prťsentťe au Dauphin.
Et ŗ la fin de ce sommet,
vous signerez conjointement le traitť.
Ce traitť est un fait nouveau
dans l'histoire de l'Europe,
associant tous les signataires,
aux principes de...
sťcuritť mutuelle et paix universelle.
Comment serait-il appliquť†?
Si l'un des pays signataires
souffre d'une agression,
tous les autres demanderont
la fin de l'agression,
s'ils ne l'obtiennent pas,
aprŤs un mois,
ils dťclareront la guerre,
jusqu'ŗ restauration de la paix.
Le traitť envisage aussi la constitution
d'une institution paneuropťenne.
Dans un certain sens,
cela me plaÓt, je le reconnais.
- Tout comme vous Thomas.
- En effet†!
C'est l'application des principes
humanistes aux relations internationales.
Votre …minence doit Ítre fťlicitťe.
Je ne cherche pas d'ťloges.
Sa Majestť sera connue comme l'architecte
d'un monde nouveau et moderne.
«a serait... une rťcompense suffisante.
Soyez, toujours assurť
de notre amour.
Bonne nuit Messieurs.
Qu'y a-t-il†?
Votre Majestť, le Duc de Buckingham
insiste pour une audience.
Votre Gr‚ce.
Votre Majestť doit Ítre avertie
que j'ai dťcouvert M. Charles Brandon
en flagrant dťlit avec ma fille.
M. Brandon a apportť la honte
sur ma famille.
Je demande que Sa Majestť
le bannisse de la cour,
ainsi que tout autre ch‚timent
que Sa Majestť jugera appropriť.
Il n'y aura pas de punition.
ņ moins que votre fille
n'accuse M. Brandon de viol†!
Est-ce ce qu'elle dit†?
Votre fille a-t-elle accusť
M. Brandon de viol†?
Elle n'en a point besoin,
l'offense est contre moi et ma famille.
Dans ce cas,
il n'y a pas eu d'offense,
et il n'y a nul besoin de punition.
Votre Majestť.
Votre Gr‚ce.
Mťfiez-vous de Buckingham, Henry.
Il est peut-Ítre stupide,
mais il a plus d'argent que vous,
et il peut se constituer
une armťe privťe.
MÍme votre pŤre ne lui tenait pas tÍte.
Je suis trŤs heureux que le Roi
de France consente ŗ signer le traitť
et ŗ Ítre l'hŰte du sommet.
Sa Majestť a ťtť charmťe par le fait
qu'il n'y ait pas de guerre.
Comme nous tous.
ņ propos des autres choses
dont on avait parlť.
Quelles autres choses, Votre …minence†?
J'ai sauvť le cul de votre maÓtre,
je veux ma rťmunťration.
Et vous pouvez m'arranger Áa.
Vous comprenez†?
Pauvre de vous.
Bien, oý en ťtions-nous quand
nous avons ťtť brutalement interrompus†?
Charles, on devrait arrÍter...
Mon pŤre vous tuera.
Alors, je mourrais
comme un homme heureux.
Bien, avez-vous tous
fini votre lecture†?
Oui, pŤre.
TrŤs bien.
Que Dieu et ses anges vous bťnissent
et vous protŤgent cette nuit...
... et toujours.
Bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit, les enfants.
<i>La lettre au Roi de France,
Votre Majestť†?</i>
"Mon royal cousin prťfťrť". Non...
…crivez plutŰt "Mon cousin adorť".
Nous vous envoyons notre amour.
Nous vous aimons tellement, qu'il serait
impossible de vous aimer plus.
Prenez toutes les dispositions
pour que l'on se voie face ŗ face.
Rien n'est maintenant plus dťsirť
et plus chťri par mon cúur que...
... ce traitť de paix universelle.
Comme preuve de ma bonne volontť,
de mon engagement ŗ cet accord et...
... de mon amour pour Votre Majestť,
j'ai dťcidť...
j'ai dťcidť...
Oui, Votre Majestť†?
J'ai dťcidť de ne plus me raser
jusqu'ŗ notre rencontre.
Ma barbe sera un signe
d'amitiť universelle,
de l'amour que l'on partage.
- Votre …minence.
- Votre Gr‚ce.
J'ai des nouvelles pour Votre …minence.
Sa Saintetť, le pape Alexandre,
est dťsespťrťment malade.
Il ne faudra pas longtemps avant
qu'il ne rejoigne la maison du Seigneur.
Considťrant la piťtť, trŤs connue,
de Votre …minence,
ainsi que vos compťtences
d'enseignement et de diplomatie,
je peux assurer ŗ Votre …minence
l'appui des cardinaux franÁais
prťsents en conclave
pour choisir un successeur.
Avec le vote de vos propres
cardinaux, et s'il plaÓt ŗ Dieu...
Vous serez ťlu Pape, ťvÍque de Rome.
Un nouveau Saint-PŤre.
Merci, Votre Gr‚ce.
Je me sens...
... vraiment humble.
 tes-vous malade, Lady Blunt†?
Non, Votre Majestť.
Restez, s'il vous plaÓt†!
Merci, bonne nuit.
On ne s'est pas parlť
depuis longtemps.
Le cardinal Wolsey a renvoyť
mon confesseur espagnol et...
... la majoritť de mes courtisanes
espagnoles, par peur des espions.
Je ne peux pas avoir confiance
en mon confesseur anglais,
mais je peux avoir confiance en vous.
Puis-je, Lady Blunt†?
Oui, Madame.
Quelle est ma tristesse†?
C'est un núud.
Je ne peux donner au roi un fils vivant.
J'ai donnť naissance
ŗ un garÁon, une fois.
Un adorable garÁon.
Mais il est mort, dans mes bras,
aprŤs seulement
4 semaines d'existence.
Le roi m'a bl‚mťe, je sais qu'il croit
que c'est entiŤrement de ma faute.
Il ignore combien j'ai souffert,
combien j'ai priť.
Je pensais ŗ mon frŤre, Arthur.
ņ sa mort... Il a ťtť dťcidť
que j'ťpouserais Catherine.
Je crois que mon pŤre
n'a pas voulu perdre son autoritť.
Ou bien le prestige
d'un mariage espagnol.
Dans tous les cas...
Catherine jura que le mariage
n'avait jamais ťtť consommť.
Gr‚ce ŗ cela, la dispense
papale a ťtť octroyťe...
... et je l'ai ťpousťe.
Et depuis, nous avons
eu cinq mort-nťs.
Un garÁon,
qui n'a vťcu que 26 jours.
Et une seule fille vivante.
Et si cette union avait
ťtť consommťe†?
Elle a jurť, devant Dieu,
que ce n'ťtait pas le cas.
Que disent les ťvangiles†?
D'un homme qui a ťpousť
la femme de son frŤre†?
Dites-moi.
Dans le Lťvitique,
il est dit que si un homme
ťpouse la femme de son frŤre...
... il mourra sans descendance.
Mais, vous avez un enfant.
Mais pas de fils†!
Je n'ai pas de fils†!
Thomas Boleyn, Votre Gr‚ce.
Thomas, j'espŤre que vous n'avez pas
trouvť mon invitation prťsomptueuse.
J'ai ouÔ dire que vous aviez
ťtť rappelť de France.
Je suis ici pour peu de temps,
Votre Gr‚ce.
Venez.
On m'a dit que vous Ítes
un excellent ambassadeur.
Alors, quels qu'ils soient,
ils sont vraiment aimables.
Vous Ítes issu d'une ancienne famille.
Pas aussi ancienne, ni grande,
que celle de Votre Gr‚ce.
Le roi aime s'entourer
de gens communs.
Des gens sans distinctions,
sans pedigree ni titres...
Comment cela aide-t-il
au prestige de la Couronne†?
- Votre Gr‚ce...
- Il rťgit la cour par la force,
non par le droit.
Votre Gr‚ce, nul ne veut revenir
aux terribles jours de la guerre civile.
Ce qui est fait, est fait†!
Le roi est le roi†!
Le roi est le roi.
Wolsey.
Un homme d'…glise
avec une maÓtresse et deux enfants†?
Cela vous plaÓt-il†?
Pas du tout.
Nous devrons en reparler.
Parlez-moi du roi de France,
Monsieur Thomas.
- Il a 23 ans.
- Est-il grand†?
Oui.
Mais mal proportionnť.
Et ses jambes†?
Sont-elles fortes, comme les miennes†?
Majestť, personne n'a
de jambes comme les vŰtres.
Est-il beau†?
Quelques personnes pourraient le penser.
Et il doit le croire, lui aussi.
Il est vaniteux†?
Votre Majestť... c'est un franÁais.
Qu'en est-il de sa cour†?
Elle a une rťputation de petite morale,
et d'Ítre licencieuse.
Et le roi, par sa propre conduite,
n'a rien ŗ lui envier.
Vous avez deux filles, Sir Thomas.
Comment les protťgez-vous†?
Je les garde sous surveillance...
Et j'ai confiance en
leur bontť et leur vertu.
Vous repartirez immťdiatement ŗ Paris.
Je vous confie toutes les nťgociations
diplomatiques pour le sommet.
…chec et mat.
Votre Majestť...
Marie†!
Papa†!
N'Ítes-vous pas la plus belle†?
N'Ítes-vous pas
la plus belle fille au monde†?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Oui, vous l'Ítes.
Comment vous sentez-vous†?
- Bien.
- Bien†?
Papa est occupť.
Soyez gentille
et faites tout ce qu'on vous dit.
Peut-on parler†?
Continuez.
Milady.
Votre Majestť.
Je n'aime pas cela.
Que n'aimez-vous pas†?
Votre barbe.
- PlutŰt ce qu'elle reprťsente.
- Catherine†!
Vous donnez ma fille au Dauphin,
et ŗ la France, sans m'avoir consultťe.
Les Valois sont les ennemis
jurťs de ma famille.
C'est ŗ moi de dire
ce qui est souhaitable.
C'est un grand mariage.
Je vois la main de Wolsey derriŤre cela.
Je vous aime, Votre Majestť,
et vous suis loyale,
dans tout les cas.
Je ne peux cacher mon souci
et ma tristesse.
Eh bien, vous y serez obligťe.
<i>Paris, France</i>
Oý sont mes filles†?
J'ai des nouvelles stupťfiantes.
Il y aura un sommet entre le roi Henri
et le roi de France, prŤs de Calais.
Je dois l'organiser.
Vous aurez l'opportunitť
de rencontrer le roi d'Angleterre.
Marie...
... et Anne Boleyn.
ņ votre futur.
Son …minence le cardinal Wolsey.
Je voudrais votre avis.
Aimez-vous ce vÍtement†?
Il sied trŤs bien
ŗ Votre Majestť.
Peut-Ítre,
puis-je vous suggťrer...
... celui-ci.
Pensez-vous que les FranÁais
ont des choses aussi raffinťes†?
S'ils en ont,
c'est qu'ils les ont volťes.
Venez.
Mangeons ensemble.
Nous pourrons parler.
Attendez.
Votre Gr‚ce va s'excuser.
J'ai dit, vous devez vous excuser.
Je m'excuse si
j'ai offensť Votre Majestť.
Votre Gr‚ce peut se retirer.
GarÁon, donne au chancelier
une nouvelle paire de chaussures.
Hopkins†!
Hopkins†!
Votre Gr‚ce.
Le moment est venu.
Parlez-moi.
Bien, tout est prÍt
pour le sommet.
Il aura lieu dans le Pas-de-Calais,
un territoire anglais,
dans une vallťe appelťe
"Le Val-dorť", la vallťe de l'or.
Mille ouvriers ont construit
un palais pour sa Majestť,
appelť "le Palais des Illusions".
Certains d'entre eux, disent que
c'est la huitiŤme merveille du monde.
Vous achŤterez le plus de tissus
d'or et d'argent que tu peux trouver,
c'est la meilleure faÁon
de corrompre les gardiens.
Oui, Votre Gr‚ce.
Ensuite, je veux que tu nous rejoignes
et que tu fasses ce qu'on a dit,
fais courir le bruit que nous engageons
des hommes pour nous dťfendre.
Oui, Votre Gr‚ce.
Lady Blunt...
... attend un enfant.
Lady Blunt†?
Si vous voulez le garder,
je prendrais des dispositions
afin qu'il soit transportť
dans une maison ŗ Jťricho,
et je la rťconcilierais avec son mari.
Mon pŤre m'a racontť comment il a
planifiť l'assassinat de Richard III.
Il devait l'attaquer avec un couteau
cachť dans ses vÍtements.
Votre Majestť.
Je suis impatient d'aller au sommet.
On va changer le monde pour toujours.
C'est mon plus grand espoir,
et mon ultime croyance.
Plus rien ne sera comme avant.
Votre …minence...
Vous et moi, nous serons immortels.

<i>Précédemment dans "The Tudors".</i>
Le roi de France a démontré
l'agressivité de sa politique.
Il a eu notre ambassadeur
assassiné de sang-froid.
Ce sont de
justes causes pour la guerre.
En tant qu'humaniste,
j'ai une haine de la guerre.
En tant que roi,
je suis forcé de désapprouver.
Pourquoi Henry V est-il célčbre ?
Il est célčbre car il a gagné
la bataille d'Agincourt.
Ce fait l'a rendu immortel.
Il n'a pas le droit ŕ tout cela.
Je suis le descendant
direct d'Édouard II.
C'est ma couronne, et ma cour.
Et non pas sa couronne ou sa cour.
C'est une trahison, Votre Grâce.
Peut-ętre Votre Majesté pourra gagner
plus de prestige pacifiquement ?
Qui sont ?
Un traité de paix
universelle et perpétuelle.
Ce traité est un fait nouveau
dans l'histoire de l'Europe,
Vous n'avez pas répondu
aux courriers de mon neveu.
Il vous conseille de ne pas écouter
tout ce que Wolsey vous dit.
Vous n'ętes pas mon ministre.
Vous n'ętes pas mon chancelier.
Vous ętes ma femme.
Concernant notre arrangement...
Quelles autres choses ?
J'ai sauvé le cul de votre maître,
je veux ma rémunération.
Et vous pouvez me l'arranger.
Je ne peux donner au roi un fils.
Le roi m'a blâmé, je sais
qu'il croit que c'est de ma faute.
Et maintenant, il ne
visite plus ma couche.
Et pour un homme qui a
épousé la femme de son frčre ?
Il mourra sans descendance.
Mais vous avez un enfant.
Mais pas de fils !
Je porte un enfant.
C'est celui de Sa Majesté.
Il y aura un sommet entre le roi Henri
et le roi François, prčs de Calais.
Vous aurez l'opportunité
de rencontrer le roi d'Angleterre.
Marie et Anne Boleyn.
Le pape Alexandre
est désespérément malade.
Je peux assurer ŕ Votre Éminence
l'appui des cardinaux français.
Vous serez élu pape.
Le moment est venu.
Mon pčre a planifié
l'assassinat de Richard III.
Il devait le saluer avec un couteau
caché dans ses vętements.
Votre Majesté.
Je suis impatient d'aller au sommet.
On va changer le monde
pour toujours.
Vous et moi, nous serons immortels.

<i>- Val d'Or -
Territoire français

Halte !
Halte !
Le voilŕ.
Le Val d'Or.
La vallée de l'or.
Et si les Français
n'arrivent pas ?
Ils viendront. Ils seront juste
en retard pour se rendre intéressants.
Regardez, Majesté. Les voilŕ !
Quel est le plan ?
J'irais tout seul rencontrer le roi.
Et si c'est un pičge ?
Et s'ils voulaient vous tuer
ŕ la minute oů vous descendrez ?
Vous tous...
Sous peine de mort...
Restez ici.
<i>Le roi.</i>
Cousin.
Cousin.
Aprčs vous.
Mais non.
Aprčs vous.
Aimez-vous ma barbe ?
Vous ressemblez
ŕ un français maintenant.
Oyez ! Oyez !
Moi, Henri, par la grâce de Dieu, roi
d'Angleterre, d'Irlande et de France,
- Par la présente...
- Arrętez !
Je ne peux ętre cela
quand vous ętes lŕ.
Je serais un menteur.
Durant ce sommet, je serais simplement
"Henri, roi d'Angleterre".
Et moi, je suis juste...
"François, roi de France
et de Bourgogne."
Majestés, puis-je vous demander
ŕ chacun de poser la main sur la Bible,
et de jurer devant Dieu, ces princes
et ces lords, ici rassemblés,
que vous serez honnętes, vertueux
et aimants l'un pour l'autre.
Je le jure.
Moi aussi, je le jure.
Princesse Marie.
Je vous présente
le prince Henri-Philippe,
votre futur mari.
Ętes-vous le Dauphin de France ?
Alors je veux vous embrasser.
Marie.
J'en veux une comme ça.
"Le Palais des Illusions",
qu'en dites-vous ?
C'est incroyable, Votre Majesté.
C'est juste une toile peinte.
Mais c'est du vrai vin.
N'en bois pas trop, Charles.
Maintenant, j'ai un présent pour vous.
Vous m'embarrassez, mon frčre.
Non, non...
Et tout ce que j'ai
ŕ vous offrir en retour...
... c'est ce gâteau.
Ŕ quoi pensez-vous Charles ?
Je pense que tant que je suis ici,
je devrais agir
comme le roi de France.
Ce qui signifie ?
Ce qui signifie que je dois
m'endormir sous la garde des autres...
... et boire l'eau
de toutes les fontaines.
Voyez-vous cette jeune femme,
vętue de pourpre et d'or ?
Oui.
Son nom est Marie Boleyn,
la fille de votre ambassadeur,
et sa sśur Anne.
J'appelle Marie "ma jument anglaise",
car je la monte trčs souvent.
Le roi Henri vous a remarquée,
aujourd'hui.
Il veut vous voir.
Attendez.
Je dois le dire ŕ Anne.
Le roi veut me voir.
Comment t'appelles-tu,
mon garçon ?
Thomas Tallis, Votre Majesté.
Tallis...
Belle voix.
Prends un souverain
pour ta chanson.
Merci, Votre Majesté.
Ah, Boleyn.
Qu'y a-t-il avec Buckingham ?
Ma présence ici n'est pas
autorisée, Votre Éminence.
Il vous traite de
nécromancien, de proxénčte,
il vous accuse d'user
de moyens diaboliques
pour garder votre emprise sur le roi.
Je veux savoir ce que
dit Buckingham du roi.
Il m'a confié qu'il avait
plus de droits au trône.
Et que si Sa Majesté n'a pas
d'héritier, et il n'en aura pas,
alors, lui, Buckingham,
accédera au trône.
Mais il m'a aussi dit qu'il allait
considérer cette éventualité rapidement.
Et de quelle maničre ?
En assassinant Sa Majesté.
Vous avez bien fait
de venir me voir.
Mais je dois vous prévenir, ne dites
rien de tout ceci ŕ qui que ce soit.
Vous voyez frčre, on vous surpasse
dans beaucoup de choses !
Nous avons les meilleurs peintres,
les meilleurs musiciens,
et les meilleurs počtes.
Dont la plupart vivent
ŕ ma Cour, Dieu merci.
Les meilleurs philosophes,
ingénieurs, architectes
Et bien sűr, nous avons
les plus belles femmes.
Vous n'allez pas le nier,
n'est-ce pas ?
Męme nos lutteurs
sont meilleurs que les vôtres.
Ętes-vous sűr ?
Comment ?
Ętes-vous sűr que tout vos lutteurs
soient meilleurs que les miens ?
Voulez-vous me le prouver ?
Que suggérez-vous ?
Je vous défie ŕ la lutte...
... frčre.
Vous ętes un lâche.
L'honneur français est en jeu.
Je relčve le défi.
Allons-y, maintenant.
Garçon.
Votre Majesté...
Non.
Majestés, messieurs,
Voici les rčgles :
le premier qui fait tomber l'autre
sera déclaré vainqueur.
Ętes-vous d'accord ?
Oui.
Le combat peut commencer !
Sur qui parions-nous ?
Allez, Henri...
Du roi ŕ la reine,
ils sont tous fous.
Lequel est fou ?
Je ne sais pas encore,
mais c'est une maison de fous.
Allez, Votre Majesté !
Henri doit gagner.
Quoiqu’il arrive, il
n'en sortira pas gagnant.
- Montrez-lui...
- Allez-y, Votre Majesté.
Je veux une revanche.
Je veux une revanche.
Avez-vous peur ?
Avez-vous peur d'une revanche ?
Dites-vous que j'ai peur ?
De quoi devrais-je avoir peur ?
De moi !
Allons-y, alors.
Je ne signerais pas le traité.
Je ne vais pas signer.
Dites-lui.
- Oh non, si je lui dis...
- Je vous ai dit d'aller lui dire.
Trčs bien.
Si Vous voulez que le monde sache
que le roi d'Angleterre est superficiel,
totalement incapable de tenir sa parole,
alors bien sűr, j'irais lui dire.
Aprčs tout, Votre Majesté,
je ne suis qu'un humble serviteur.
Lady Marie.
Majesté.
J'ai beaucoup entendu parler de vous.
Vous ętes ŕ la cour de France
depuis deux ans.
Dites-moi...
Quelles grâces françaises
avez-vous apprises ?
Avec la permission de Votre Majesté...
Je vous en prie.
Et maintenant, je demande
ŕ Sa Majesté le roi d'Angleterre,
d'apposer son accord au traité
de paix universelle et perpétuelle.
<i>Palais Whitehall
- Londres -</i>
Partez.
<i>Oubliez les Français.</i>
<i>Le neveu de la reine a été élu.</i>
Il n'est plus seulement
Charles V, roi d'Espagne,
il est aussi le Saint Empereur Romain.
Ses territoires sont vastes.
Sa richesse est immense.
Et il n'a que 20 ans.
Vous nous arrangerez
une visite en Aragon.
Personnellement.
Et assurez-vous de traiter avec lui
et non pas avec les Français.
Oui, Majesté.
Sir Thomas Boleyn, Votre Grâce.
- Votre Grâce, je...
- Qu'avez-vous pensé de sa performance ?
Ne soyez pas stupide.
Vous ne l'ętes pas.
La performance du roi, lors du sommet.
Comment l'avez-vous trouvée ?
Personnellement, j'aurais
voulu voir un homme
plus fort, plus puissant,
pour représenter le trône d'Angleterre.
Quelqu'un dont la seule présence
aurait fait s'agenouiller les Français.
J'ai la maničre et les moyens,
pour écraser l'usurpateur de mon trône,
comme on écrase
une araignée dégoűtante.
Je lui ferais regretter de
n'ętre point entré dans les ordres
et de ne pas avoir laissé le pouvoir
ŕ ceux qui sont nés pour gouverner.
Si vous me trahissez, Boleyn...
je jetterais votre cadavre
aux chiens.
Maintenant.
Qu'avez-vous découvert ?
Je n'ai pas l'autorité
suffisante pour le dire...
... mais Le Duc de Buckingham
a levé une armée.
Il dit que c'est pour protéger
ses biens pendant son absence,
mais ce n'est pas pour
ça qu'il le fait.
Il a aussi acheté
de grosses sommes d'argent
Buckingham.
Invitez-le au palais
pour la fęte du Nouvel An.
Mais ne dites rien qui puisse l'alarmer.
Comment vont vos enfants ?
Trčs bien, merci Votre Majesté.
Je les stimule pour qu’ils étudient.
Męme les filles.
Toujours idéaliste.
Ŕ un certain point, j'imagine,
il sera ordinaire et pas du tout étrange
que les filles soient instruites.
J'ai reçu un cadeau du Duc d'Urbino.
C'est un livre appelé "Les principes",
d'un florentin, Nicholas Machiavel.
Oui, je le connais.
Il traite des opportunités politiques.
C'est vrai.
Il est différent de
votre livre "Utopie".
C'est moins...
... utopique.
Néanmoins,
j'ai une importante question.
Est-il préférable pour un roi
d'ętre craint ou aimé ?
Buckingham va essayer de me tuer.
Votre Éminence.
Lady Blunt.
Vous ętes ŕ terme ?
Trčs bientôt.
Vous allez bien ?
Comme prévu.
Avez-vous des messages
de Sa Majesté ?
Non, pas de lui...
Mais de votre époux.
Mon époux.
Oui, je lui ai parlé.
Il veut se réconcilier,
selon vos conditions.
Et il ne m'enverra pas au couvent ?
Il deviendra Comte
et on lui donnera un état.
Et mon enfant ?
C'est au roi de décider
s'il reconnaît l'enfant.
Je ne puis vous donner
plus de réconfort que cela.
Pourrez-vous dire au roi
mon amour pour lui ?
<i>Comté de Buckingham
- Penshurst -</i>
Milord.
Je viens ici pour jurer fidélité
ŕ vous et ŕ votre maison.
Je jure de vous servir jusqu'ŕ la mort.
Vous ętes remercié
du fond de nos cśurs.
Et cette fidélité sera récompensée,
d'une façon somptueuse et appropriée.
Je devrais peut-ętre vous le dire.
On m'a envoyé rencontrer
le nouveau Saint Empereur Romain.
Le roi m'a demandé de préparer
un nouveau traité...
... nous unissant
contre les Français.
Vous devez ętre trčs déçu.
Je suis trčs... réaliste.
Je suis déçu.
Nos ręves étaient trop peu réalistes.
Peut-ętre, mais je continuerai ŕ ręver,
męme si je suis seul ŕ le faire.
J'ai peur que Sa Majesté n'ait plus...
... confiance en moi comme avant.
Thomas, laissez-moi
vous donner un petit conseil.
Si vous voulez garder l'amour d'un
prince, voilŕ ce que vous devez faire...
Vous devez ętre pręt
ŕ lui donner la chose
que vous appréciez le plus au monde.
La chose que j'apprécie le plus,
c'est mon intégrité.
Qu'est-ce que vous appréciez
le plus, Votre Éminence ?
Sa Grâce, le Duc de Norfolk.
Votre Grâce.
J'espčre que Sa Majesté acceptera
ce modeste présent
pour la nouvelle année.
Nous sommes trčs
reconnaissants ŕ Votre Grâce,
votre générosité nous touche,
comme toujours.
Détendez-vous.
Appelez les servantes.
Sa Grâce, le Duc de Buckingham.
Votre Grâce.
Votre Majesté.
Il y a quelques mots gravés.
Donnez-le-moi.
"Avec un cśur humble et sincčre."
Votre Grâce me touche toujours.
Vos mots m'émeuvent.
Ce sont les plus beaux présents.
Meilleurs que toute richesse.
Respirez...
Il arrive.
"Avec un cśur humble et sincčre."
Lŕ-bas.
Arrętez-vous, Votre Grâce.
Que voulez-vous ?
Votre Grâce est arrętée,
pour suspicion de trahison.
J'ai ordre de Sa Majesté
de vous emmener ŕ la tour.
Si vous voulez un conseil,
Messieurs, laissez-moi passer.
Pas question.
Et si l'un de vos hommes
attaque les serviteurs de Sa Majesté,
dans l'exécution de leur mission,
c'est aussi de la trahison,
comme Votre Grâce doit le savoir.
Votre Grâce...
Vous... vous n'ętes que des parvenus,
vous ne savez rien.
Je suis accusé de trahison,
je dois ętre jugé
par un jury de mes pairs,
non par des chiens de bouchers.
Il n'existe aucun Lord en Angleterre
qui osera me faire face.
Emmenez-le.
J'ai institué une cour de hauts juges,
pour traiter le cas de Buckingham.
20 pairs seront cités ŕ la cour.
Norfolk sera le premier d'entre eux.
Votre Majesté, si je peux...
Quoi ?
Je pense que ça pourrait ętre dangereux,
de condamner le Duc pour trahison.
Męme si c'est le cas ?
Męme si c'est le cas.
D'un autre côté, on pourrait le
condamner pour d'autres délits mineurs,
que nous découvrirons,
et l'expulser de la cour.
De cette maničre, il sera
en disgrâce de ses amis et alliés,
qui auront peu de raisons et d'occasions
de se rebeller contre vous.
Et cela serait la meilleure solution ?
Je crois que oui.
Et vous ferez en sorte que la cour
approuve cette décision ?
Ayez pleinement confiance.
Comme celle que j'ai en vous,
Votre Éminence.
Wolsey s'arrangera avec la Cour.
Norfolk la présidera.
Je veux que vous rappeliez ŕ Sa Grâce
quelles sont ses responsabilités.
40/40.
Changez de côté, Messieurs.
Balle.
Marie.
Est-ce que le roi
vous appelle encore la nuit ?
Non, papa.
Vous savez que le roi est votre parrain.
Quand vous vous approchez...
Votre Grâce.
Que voulez-vous ?
Je vous transmets les meilleurs
sentiments de Sa Majesté.
Il a apprécié votre rôle dans
le jugement de Milord Buckingham.
Et pour le soin que vous avez
pour le bien-ętre de Sa Majesté.
Il vous envoie aussi cela.
C'est la bague de mon pčre.
Il fűt exécuté par le pčre
de Sa Majesté. Le saviez-vous ?
Sa Majesté a pensé que
vous voudriez peut-ętre la porter.
C'est votre fils.
Oui. Il va ętre reçu par son parrain...
Le roi.
Votre Grâce devrait prendre
soin de son héritier.
Il serait terrible, par exemple,
que l'un de vos faits le prive
d'un pčre, d'un titre ou d'un anneau.
Votre Grâce.
Votre Grâce a été accusée de trahison,
et d'avoir prévu et comploté
la mort de Sa Majesté le roi.
Cette cour de hauts juges, aprčs avoir
examiné toutes les preuves contre vous,
déclare Votre Grâce... coupable
des charges retenues contre vous.
Non.
Et la sentence de Votre Grâce
est la mort, ŕ la discrétion du roi.
C'est votre śuvre !
Chiens de bouchers !
Tout cela est votre śuvre !
Votre Majesté.
Dieu vous bénisse, Monseigneur.
Prenez-le, Votre Grâce.
Traître !
Traître !
Me pardonnerez-vous ?
Votre Grâce doit se baisser.
Quand vous tendrez vos bras,
je frapperais.
Tendez vos bras !
J'ai un fils.
J'ai un fils !
Merci mon Dieu !
Merci mon Dieu !
J'ai un fils !
J'ai un fils, mon Dieu !
M'entends-tu ?
J'ai un fils !
Je félicite Votre Majesté pour
un aussi heureux événement.
Merci, Votre Éminence.
Milady est ŕ l'étage.
Henri.
Félicitations.
Merci, Charles.
J'ai toujours su que
ça n'était pas de ma faute.
Non.
Sa Majesté a décidé
de reconnaître son fils.
Il sera connu ŕ partir de maintenant
en tant qu'Henri Fitzroy.
Il aura son propre établissement,
représenté par une maison.
Avec un aumônier, des gardes,
et il espčre que vous tirerez avantage
de cette situation.
Merci.
Vous devez remercier Sa Majesté,
je ne fais que ce qu'il m'ordonne.
<i>La reine ! La reine !</i>
Ŕ mon fils !
<i>Basilique Saint-Pierre
- Rome -</i>
Quel arrangement avez-vous
conclu avec Wolsey ?
En échange de la paix
entre nos deux pays,
je lui ai promis le vote français.
Le fait est que Wolsey se rend ŕ Aix,
pour rencontrer le nouvel Empereur.
De toute évidence, ils veulent
rompre le traité avec votre roi.
Dans ce cas, nous ne serons plus obligés
d'honorer notre part du marché.
De toute maničre, nous ne voulons
pas d'un pape anglais.
Nous en avions un.
Il était fou.
Plus jamais.
Le pape sera un Italien.
C'est la volonté de Dieu.
Votre Sainteté doit l'avaler.
Poussez-le !
Notre Dame pleine de Grâce,
je vous prie, je vous implore
non par pitié pour mon amour,
mais pour votre fils Jésus-Christ.
Je vous en prie,
donnez-moi un enfant.
Un fils qui occupera mon ventre vide.
Je vous supplie.
Dans quelques semaines, la cour
va quitter Whitehall pour Hampton Court.
Il y a eu une épidémie
de fičvre dans la cité,
vous savez comme
le roi craint toute maladie.
Comment va le roi ?
J'étais désolé d'apprendre que
le cardinal Rossini a été élu pape.
Ne vous lamentez pas
perpétuellement, More.
J'essayais juste d'ętre poli.
Oh, réellement ?
Je ne l'étais pas.
Tant qu'il y aura de la corruption
au sein de l'église,
ces hérétiques continueront
ŕ avoir des disciples.
Je sais que si Votre Éminence
avait été élu,
il aurait śuvré inlassablement
afin d'éliminer les pratiques
malveillantes de l'Église.
Peut-ętre avez-vous une trop
grande opinion de moi, Thomas.
Peut-ętre avez-vous une trop grande
opinion de toute la race humaine.
Lady Blunt.
Monsieur More.
<i>La reine !</i>
Milady.
<i>La reine !</i>
Mon oncle.
Anne.
Ma chérie.
Oui, papa.
Savez-vous pourquoi vous ętes ici ?
Non, papa.
Personne ne me l'a expliqué ŕ Paris.
Bien, c'est meilleur ainsi.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Sa Majesté est fatiguée
de son alliance avec la France.
Il me semble qu'il est également
fatigué de votre soeur,
il ne l'invite plus dans sa couche.
- Pauvre Marie.
- Pauvre de nous.
Quand elle était sa maîtresse,
notre fortune était faite.
Maintenant, le plus probable,
c'est qu'elle sombrera.
Ŕ moins que...
Et męme s'il m'a,
qui peut garantir qu'il me gardera ?
Ce n'est pas que Marie. On dit que
toutes ses relations ne durent pas.
Des coups de feu
puis des coups de glace.
Peut-ętre pourriez-vous
imaginer un moyen
de maintenir son intéręt
plus... longtemps ?
Je sais que vous avez appris
beaucoup de choses en France.
Comme jouer avec les passions.
Il ya quelque chose de profond
et de dangereux en vous, Anne.
Vos yeux sont d'obscurs
pičges pour l'âme.
Comment était votre réunion
avec l'Empereur ?
Bonne.
Productive.
Il ne cache pas son antipathie
pour les Français.
Il veut rentrer en guerre contre eux,
et il attend avec impatience
de former une alliance
avec Votre Majesté.
Quels sont les termes de l'alliance ?
Il y aura une invasion
conjointe de la France,
pour destituer le roi François.
Et je réclamerais la couronne.
Je serais réellement le roi
d'Angleterre, d'Irlande...
... et de France.
Ŕ l'égal de mes ancętres.
Votre Éminence a construit
le plus beau des palais.
Merci, Votre Majesté.
Certainement la plus belle
demeure d'Angleterre.
Je n'ai rien de comparable.
Rien qui l'égale.
Votre Majesté.
Je vous l'offre.
Avec les meubles ?
Allez !

en retard pour se rendre intťressants.
Regardez, Majestť. Les voilŗ†!
Quel est le plan†?
J'irais tout seul rencontrer le roi.
Et si c'est un piŤge†?
Et s'ils voulaient vous tuer
ŗ la minute oý vous descendrez†?
Vous tous...
Sous peine de mort...
Restez ici.
<i>Le roi.</i>
Cousin.
Cousin.
AprŤs vous.
Mais non.
AprŤs vous.
Aimez-vous ma barbe†?
Vous ressemblez
ŗ un franÁais maintenant.
Oyez†! Oyez†!
Moi, Henri, par la gr‚ce de Dieu, roi
d'Angleterre, d'Irlande et de France,
- Par la prťsente...
- ArrÍtez†!
Je ne peux Ítre cela
quand vous Ítes lŗ.
Je serais un menteur.
Durant ce sommet, je serais simplement
"Henri, roi d'Angleterre".
Et moi, je suis juste...
"FranÁois, roi de France
et de Bourgogne."
Majestťs, puis-je vous demander
ŗ chacun de poser la main sur la Bible,
et de jurer devant Dieu, ces princes
et ces lords, ici rassemblťs,
que vous serez honnÍtes, vertueux
et aimants l'un pour l'autre.
Je le jure.
Moi aussi, je le jure.
Princesse Marie.
Je vous prťsente
le prince Henri-Philippe,
votre futur mari.
 tes-vous le Dauphin de France†?
Alors je veux vous embrasser.
Marie.
J'en veux une comme Áa.
"Le Palais des Illusions",
qu'en dites-vous†?
C'est incroyable, Votre Majestť.
C'est juste une toile peinte.
Mais c'est du vrai vin.
N'en bois pas trop, Charles.
Maintenant, j'ai un prťsent pour vous.
Vous m'embarrassez, mon frŤre.
Non, non...
Et tout ce que j'ai
ŗ vous offrir en retour...
... c'est ce g‚teau.
ņ quoi pensez-vous Charles†?
Je pense que tant que je suis ici,
je devrais agir
comme le roi de France.
Ce qui signifie†?
Ce qui signifie que je dois
m'endormir sous la garde des autres...
... et boire l'eau
de toutes les fontaines.
Voyez-vous cette jeune femme,
vÍtue de pourpre et d'or†?
Oui.
Son nom est Marie Boleyn,
la fille de votre ambassadeur,
et sa súur Anne.
J'appelle Marie "ma jument anglaise",
car je la monte trŤs souvent.
Le roi Henri vous a remarquťe,
aujourd'hui.
Il veut vous voir.
Attendez.
Je dois le dire ŗ Anne.
Le roi veut me voir.
Comment t'appelles-tu,
mon garÁon†?
Thomas Tallis, Votre Majestť.
Tallis...
Belle voix.
Prends un souverain
pour ta chanson.
Merci, Votre Majestť.
Ah, Boleyn.
Qu'y a-t-il avec Buckingham†?
Ma prťsence ici n'est pas
autorisťe, Votre …minence.
Il vous traite de
nťcromancien, de proxťnŤte,
il vous accuse d'user
de moyens diaboliques
pour garder votre emprise sur le roi.
Je veux savoir ce que
dit Buckingham du roi.
Il m'a confiť qu'il avait
plus de droits au trŰne.
Et que si Sa Majestť n'a pas
d'hťritier, et il n'en aura pas,
alors, lui, Buckingham,
accťdera au trŰne.
Mais il m'a aussi dit qu'il allait
considťrer cette ťventualitť rapidement.
Et de quelle maniŤre†?
En assassinant Sa Majestť.
Vous avez bien fait
de venir me voir.
Mais je dois vous prťvenir, ne dites
rien de tout ceci ŗ qui que ce soit.
Vous voyez frŤre, on vous surpasse
dans beaucoup de choses†!
Nous avons les meilleurs peintres,
les meilleurs musiciens,
et les meilleurs poŤtes.
Dont la plupart vivent
ŗ ma Cour, Dieu merci.
Les meilleurs philosophes,
ingťnieurs, architectes
Et bien sŻr, nous avons
les plus belles femmes.
Vous n'allez pas le nier,
n'est-ce pas†?
MÍme nos lutteurs
sont meilleurs que les vŰtres.
 tes-vous sŻr†?
Comment†?
 tes-vous sŻr que tout vos lutteurs
soient meilleurs que les miens†?
Voulez-vous me le prouver†?
Que suggťrez-vous†?
Je vous dťfie ŗ la lutte...
... frŤre.
Vous Ítes un l‚che.
L'honneur franÁais est en jeu.
Je relŤve le dťfi.
Allons-y, maintenant.
GarÁon.
Votre Majestť...
Non.
Majestťs, messieurs,
Voici les rŤgles†:
le premier qui fait tomber l'autre
sera dťclarť vainqueur.
 tes-vous d'accord†?
Oui.
Le combat peut commencer†!
Sur qui parions-nous†?
Allez, Henri...
Du roi ŗ la reine,
ils sont tous fous.
Lequel est fou†?
Je ne sais pas encore,
mais c'est une maison de fous.
Allez, Votre Majestť†!
Henri doit gagner.
Quoiquíil arrive, il
n'en sortira pas gagnant.
- Montrez-lui...
- Allez-y, Votre Majestť.
Je veux une revanche.
Je veux une revanche.
Avez-vous peur†?
Avez-vous peur d'une revanche†?
Dites-vous que j'ai peur†?
De quoi devrais-je avoir peur†?
De moi†!
Allons-y, alors.
Je ne signerais pas le traitť.
Je ne vais pas signer.
Dites-lui.
- Oh non, si je lui dis...
- Je vous ai dit d'aller lui dire.
TrŤs bien.
Si Vous voulez que le monde sache
que le roi d'Angleterre est superficiel,
totalement incapable de tenir sa parole,
alors bien sŻr, j'irais lui dire.
AprŤs tout, Votre Majestť,
je ne suis qu'un humble serviteur.
Lady Marie.
Majestť.
J'ai beaucoup entendu parler de vous.
Vous Ítes ŗ la cour de France
depuis deux ans.
Dites-moi...
Quelles gr‚ces franÁaises
avez-vous apprises†?
Avec la permission de Votre Majestť...
Je vous en prie.
Et maintenant, je demande
ŗ Sa Majestť le roi d'Angleterre,
d'apposer son accord au traitť
de paix universelle et perpťtuelle.
<i>Palais Whitehall
- Londres -</i>
Partez.
<i>Oubliez les FranÁais.</i>
<i>Le neveu de la reine a ťtť ťlu.</i>
Il n'est plus seulement
Charles V, roi d'Espagne,
il est aussi le Saint Empereur Romain.
Ses territoires sont vastes.
Sa richesse est immense.
Et il n'a que 20 ans.
Vous nous arrangerez
une visite en Aragon.
Personnellement.
Et assurez-vous de traiter avec lui
et non pas avec les FranÁais.
Oui, Majestť.
Sir Thomas Boleyn, Votre Gr‚ce.
- Votre Gr‚ce, je...
- Qu'avez-vous pensť de sa performance†?
Ne soyez pas stupide.
Vous ne l'Ítes pas.
La performance du roi, lors du sommet.
Comment l'avez-vous trouvťe†?
Personnellement, j'aurais
voulu voir un homme
plus fort, plus puissant,
pour reprťsenter le trŰne d'Angleterre.
Quelqu'un dont la seule prťsence
aurait fait s'agenouiller les FranÁais.
J'ai la maniŤre et les moyens,
pour ťcraser l'usurpateur de mon trŰne,
comme on ťcrase
une araignťe dťgoŻtante.
Je lui ferais regretter de
n'Ítre point entrť dans les ordres
et de ne pas avoir laissť le pouvoir
ŗ ceux qui sont nťs pour gouverner.
Si vous me trahissez, Boleyn...
je jetterais votre cadavre
aux chiens.
Maintenant.
Qu'avez-vous dťcouvert†?
Je n'ai pas l'autoritť
suffisante pour le dire...
... mais Le Duc de Buckingham
a levť une armťe.
Il dit que c'est pour protťger
ses biens pendant son absence,
mais ce n'est pas pour
Áa qu'il le fait.
Il a aussi achetť
de grosses sommes d'argent
Buckingham.
Invitez-le au palais
pour la fÍte du Nouvel An.
Mais ne dites rien qui puisse l'alarmer.
Comment vont vos enfants†?
TrŤs bien, merci Votre Majestť.
Je les stimule pour quíils ťtudient.
MÍme les filles.
Toujours idťaliste.
ņ un certain point, j'imagine,
il sera ordinaire et pas du tout ťtrange
que les filles soient instruites.
J'ai reÁu un cadeau du Duc d'Urbino.
C'est un livre appelť "Les principes",
d'un florentin, Nicholas Machiavel.
Oui, je le connais.
Il traite des opportunitťs politiques.
C'est vrai.
Il est diffťrent de
votre livre "Utopie".
C'est moins...
... utopique.
Nťanmoins,
j'ai une importante question.
Est-il prťfťrable pour un roi
d'Ítre craint ou aimť†?
Buckingham va essayer de me tuer.
Votre …minence.
Lady Blunt.
Vous Ítes ŗ terme†?
TrŤs bientŰt.
Vous allez bien†?
Comme prťvu.
Avez-vous des messages
de Sa Majestť†?
Non, pas de lui...
Mais de votre ťpoux.
Mon ťpoux.
Oui, je lui ai parlť.
Il veut se rťconcilier,
selon vos conditions.
Et il ne m'enverra pas au couvent†?
Il deviendra Comte
et on lui donnera un ťtat.
Et mon enfant†?
C'est au roi de dťcider
s'il reconnaÓt l'enfant.
Je ne puis vous donner
plus de rťconfort que cela.
Pourrez-vous dire au roi
mon amour pour lui†?
<i>Comtť de Buckingham
- Penshurst -</i>
Milord.
Je viens ici pour jurer fidťlitť
ŗ vous et ŗ votre maison.
Je jure de vous servir jusqu'ŗ la mort.
Vous Ítes remerciť
du fond de nos cúurs.
Et cette fidťlitť sera rťcompensťe,
d'une faÁon somptueuse et appropriťe.
Je devrais peut-Ítre vous le dire.
On m'a envoyť rencontrer
le nouveau Saint Empereur Romain.
Le roi m'a demandť de prťparer
un nouveau traitť...
... nous unissant
contre les FranÁais.
Vous devez Ítre trŤs dťÁu.
Je suis trŤs... rťaliste.
Je suis dťÁu.
Nos rÍves ťtaient trop peu rťalistes.
Peut-Ítre, mais je continuerai ŗ rÍver,
mÍme si je suis seul ŗ le faire.
J'ai peur que Sa Majestť n'ait plus...
... confiance en moi comme avant.
Thomas, laissez-moi
vous donner un petit conseil.
Si vous voulez garder l'amour d'un
prince, voilŗ ce que vous devez faire...
Vous devez Ítre prÍt
ŗ lui donner la chose
que vous apprťciez le plus au monde.
La chose que j'apprťcie le plus,
c'est mon intťgritť.
Qu'est-ce que vous apprťciez
le plus, Votre …minence†?
Sa Gr‚ce, le Duc de Norfolk.
Votre Gr‚ce.
J'espŤre que Sa Majestť acceptera
ce modeste prťsent
pour la nouvelle annťe.
Nous sommes trŤs
reconnaissants ŗ Votre Gr‚ce,
votre gťnťrositť nous touche,
comme toujours.
Dťtendez-vous.
Appelez les servantes.
Sa Gr‚ce, le Duc de Buckingham.
Votre Gr‚ce.
Votre Majestť.
Il y a quelques mots gravťs.
Donnez-le-moi.
"Avec un cúur humble et sincŤre."
Votre Gr‚ce me touche toujours.
Vos mots m'ťmeuvent.
Ce sont les plus beaux prťsents.
Meilleurs que toute richesse.
Respirez...
Il arrive.
"Avec un cúur humble et sincŤre."
Lŗ-bas.
ArrÍtez-vous, Votre Gr‚ce.
Que voulez-vous†?
Votre Gr‚ce est arrÍtťe,
pour suspicion de trahison.
J'ai ordre de Sa Majestť
de vous emmener ŗ la tour.
Si vous voulez un conseil,
Messieurs, laissez-moi passer.
Pas question.
Et si l'un de vos hommes
attaque les serviteurs de Sa Majestť,
dans l'exťcution de leur mission,
c'est aussi de la trahison,
comme Votre Gr‚ce doit le savoir.
Votre Gr‚ce...
Vous... vous n'Ítes que des parvenus,
vous ne savez rien.
Je suis accusť de trahison,
je dois Ítre jugť
par un jury de mes pairs,
non par des chiens de bouchers.
Il n'existe aucun Lord en Angleterre
qui osera me faire face.
Emmenez-le.
J'ai instituť une cour de hauts juges,
pour traiter le cas de Buckingham.
20 pairs seront citťs ŗ la cour.
Norfolk sera le premier d'entre eux.
Votre Majestť, si je peux...
Quoi†?
Je pense que Áa pourrait Ítre dangereux,
de condamner le Duc pour trahison.
MÍme si c'est le cas†?
MÍme si c'est le cas.
D'un autre cŰtť, on pourrait le
condamner pour d'autres dťlits mineurs,
que nous dťcouvrirons,
et l'expulser de la cour.
De cette maniŤre, il sera
en disgr‚ce de ses amis et alliťs,
qui auront peu de raisons et d'occasions
de se rebeller contre vous.
Et cela serait la meilleure solution†?
Je crois que oui.
Et vous ferez en sorte que la cour
approuve cette dťcision†?
Ayez pleinement confiance.
Comme celle que j'ai en vous,
Votre …minence.
Wolsey s'arrangera avec la Cour.
Norfolk la prťsidera.
Je veux que vous rappeliez ŗ Sa Gr‚ce
quelles sont ses responsabilitťs.
40/40.
Changez de cŰtť, Messieurs.
Balle.
Marie.
Est-ce que le roi
vous appelle encore la nuit†?
Non, papa.
Vous savez que le roi est votre parrain.
Quand vous vous approchez...
Votre Gr‚ce.
Que voulez-vous†?
Je vous transmets les meilleurs
sentiments de Sa Majestť.
Il a apprťciť votre rŰle dans
le jugement de Milord Buckingham.
Et pour le soin que vous avez
pour le bien-Ítre de Sa Majestť.
Il vous envoie aussi cela.
C'est la bague de mon pŤre.
Il fŻt exťcutť par le pŤre
de Sa Majestť. Le saviez-vous†?
Sa Majestť a pensť que
vous voudriez peut-Ítre la porter.
C'est votre fils.
Oui. Il va Ítre reÁu par son parrain...
Le roi.
Votre Gr‚ce devrait prendre
soin de son hťritier.
Il serait terrible, par exemple,
que l'un de vos faits le prive
d'un pŤre, d'un titre ou d'un anneau.
Votre Gr‚ce.
Votre Gr‚ce a ťtť accusťe de trahison,
et d'avoir prťvu et complotť
la mort de Sa Majestť le roi.
Cette cour de hauts juges, aprŤs avoir
examinť toutes les preuves contre vous,
dťclare Votre Gr‚ce... coupable
des charges retenues contre vous.
Non.
Et la sentence de Votre Gr‚ce
est la mort, ŗ la discrťtion du roi.
C'est votre úuvre†!
Chiens de bouchers†!
Tout cela est votre úuvre†!
Votre Majestť.
Dieu vous bťnisse, Monseigneur.
Prenez-le, Votre Gr‚ce.
TraÓtre†!
TraÓtre†!
Me pardonnerez-vous†?
Votre Gr‚ce doit se baisser.
Quand vous tendrez vos bras,
je frapperais.
Tendez vos bras†!
J'ai un fils.
J'ai un fils†!
Merci mon Dieu†!
Merci mon Dieu†!
J'ai un fils†!
J'ai un fils, mon Dieu†!
M'entends-tu†?
J'ai un fils†!
Je fťlicite Votre Majestť pour
un aussi heureux ťvťnement.
Merci, Votre …minence.
Milady est ŗ l'ťtage.
Henri.
Fťlicitations.
Merci, Charles.
J'ai toujours su que
Áa n'ťtait pas de ma faute.
Non.
Sa Majestť a dťcidť
de reconnaÓtre son fils.
Il sera connu ŗ partir de maintenant
en tant qu'Henri Fitzroy.
Il aura son propre ťtablissement,
reprťsentť par une maison.
Avec un aumŰnier, des gardes,
et il espŤre que vous tirerez avantage
de cette situation.
Merci.
Vous devez remercier Sa Majestť,
je ne fais que ce qu'il m'ordonne.

Quel arrangement avez-vous
conclu avec Wolsey†?
En ťchange de la paix
entre nos deux pays,
je lui ai promis le vote franÁais.
Le fait est que Wolsey se rend ŗ Aix,
pour rencontrer le nouvel Empereur.
De toute ťvidence, ils veulent
rompre le traitť avec votre roi.
Dans ce cas, nous ne serons plus obligťs
d'honorer notre part du marchť.
De toute maniŤre, nous ne voulons
pas d'un pape anglais.
Nous en avions un.
Il ťtait fou.
Plus jamais.
Le pape sera un Italien.
C'est la volontť de Dieu.
Votre Saintetť doit l'avaler.
Poussez-le†!
Notre Dame pleine de Gr‚ce,
je vous prie, je vous implore
non par pitiť pour mon amour,
mais pour votre fils Jťsus-Christ.
Je vous en prie,
donnez-moi un enfant.
Un fils qui occupera mon ventre vide.
Je vous supplie.
Dans quelques semaines, la cour
va quitter Whitehall pour Hampton Court.
Il y a eu une ťpidťmie
de fiŤvre dans la citť,
vous savez comme
le roi craint toute maladie.
Comment va le roi†?
J'ťtais dťsolť d'apprendre que
le cardinal Rossini a ťtť ťlu pape.
Ne vous lamentez pas
perpťtuellement, More.
J'essayais juste d'Ítre poli.
Oh, rťellement†?
Je ne l'ťtais pas.
Tant qu'il y aura de la corruption
au sein de l'ťglise,
ces hťrťtiques continueront
ŗ avoir des disciples.
Je sais que si Votre …minence
avait ťtť ťlu,
il aurait úuvrť inlassablement
afin d'ťliminer les pratiques
malveillantes de l'…glise.
Peut-Ítre avez-vous une trop
grande opinion de moi, Thomas.
Peut-Ítre avez-vous une trop grande
opinion de toute la race humaine.
Lady Blunt.
Monsieur More.
<i>La reine†!</i>
Milady.
<i>La reine†!</i>
Mon oncle.
Anne.
Ma chťrie.
Oui, papa.
Savez-vous pourquoi vous Ítes ici†?
Non, papa.
Personne ne me l'a expliquť ŗ Paris.
Bien, c'est meilleur ainsi.
Que s'est-il passť†?
Sa Majestť est fatiguťe
de son alliance avec la France.
Il me semble qu'il est ťgalement
fatiguť de votre soeur,
il ne l'invite plus dans sa couche.
- Pauvre Marie.
- Pauvre de nous.
Quand elle ťtait sa maÓtresse,
notre fortune ťtait faite.
Maintenant, le plus probable,
c'est qu'elle sombrera.
ņ moins que...
Et mÍme s'il m'a,
qui peut garantir qu'il me gardera†?
Ce n'est pas que Marie. On dit que
toutes ses relations ne durent pas.
Des coups de feu
puis des coups de glace.
Peut-Ítre pourriez-vous
imaginer un moyen
de maintenir son intťrÍt
plus... longtemps†?
Je sais que vous avez appris
beaucoup de choses en France.
Comme jouer avec les passions.
Il ya quelque chose de profond
et de dangereux en vous, Anne.
Vos yeux sont d'obscurs
piŤges pour l'‚me.
Comment ťtait votre rťunion
avec l'Empereur†?
Bonne.
Productive.
Il ne cache pas son antipathie
pour les FranÁais.
Il veut rentrer en guerre contre eux,
et il attend avec impatience
de former une alliance
avec Votre Majestť.
Quels sont les termes de l'alliance†?
Il y aura une invasion
conjointe de la France,
pour destituer le roi FranÁois.
Et je rťclamerais la couronne.
Je serais rťellement le roi
d'Angleterre, d'Irlande...
... et de France.
ņ l'ťgal de mes ancÍtres.
Votre …minence a construit
le plus beau des palais.
Merci, Votre Majestť.
Certainement la plus belle
demeure d'Angleterre.
Je n'ai rien de comparable.
Rien qui l'ťgale.
Votre Majestť.
Je vous l'offre.
Avec les meubles†?
Allez†!
<i>Précédemment dans "The Tudors"</i>
Il y aura un sommet entre
le roi de France et le roi Henri.
Puis-je demander au roi d'Angleterre,
de signer le traité de paix
universelle et perpétuelle ?
Vous donnez ma fille au Dauphin
et à la France sans m'avoir consultée.
C'est à moi de dire
ce qui est souhaitable.
Je vois la main de Wolsey,
derrière cela.
Quel arrangement avez-vous
conclu avec Wolsey ?
En échange de la paix
entre nos deux pays,
je lui ai promis le vote français.
Le fait est que Wolsey
va rencontrer le nouvel Empereur.
De toute évidence, ils veulent
rompre le traité avec votre roi.
Je suis désolé d'apprendre que
le cardinal Rossini a été élu pape.
Tant qu'il y aura de la corruption
au sein de l'Église,
cet hérétique, Luther, continuera
à gagner des disciples.
Peut-être avez-vous une trop
grande opinion de moi, Thomas.
Le neveu de la reine a été élu.
Il n'est plus seulement
Charles V, roi d'Espagne,
mais il est aussi
le Saint Empereur Romain.
Assurez-vous de traiter avec lui
et non pas avec les français.
Buckingham m'a dit que sa majesté
n'a pas d'héritier,
et qu'il accédera au trône
en assassinant Sa Majesté.
Votre Grâce est arrêtée,
pour suspicion de trahison.
C'est votre œuvre !
Tout cela est votre œuvre !
Et mon enfant ?
C'est au roi de décider
s'il reconnaît l'enfant.
À mon fils !
Je vous en prie, je vous implore...
Donnez-moi un enfant.
Un fils qui occupera mon ventre vide.
Sa Majesté est lassée de votre sœur.
Il ne l'invite plus dans sa couche.
On dit toutes que ses liaisons
ne durent pas.
Chérie, peut-être pourriez-vous
imaginer un moyen
de maintenir son intérêt
plus longtemps ?
<i>Vous pensiez connaître l'Histoire.</i>
<i>Mais vous ne connaissez que la fin.</i>
<i>Pour parvenir au cœur de l'histoire.</i>
<i>Vous devez la reprendre du début.</i>

Essayons encore une fois.
Tout le monde !
Fermez la porte.
Concentrez-vous, s'il vous plaît !
Tout le monde est prêt ?!
Attaquez !
Mais allez-y, attaquez !
C'est assez, tout le monde.
Arrêtez...
Arrêtez !
Avez-vous une idée
du coût de cette production ?
Pensez-vous vraiment,
que Sa Majesté serait contente
de dépenser une petite fortune...
... pour une aussi
grande porcherie ?
Qui a tiré au mousquet, hum ?
Je crois que c'est moi,
M. Cornish, Sir.
Qu'essayez-vous de faire ?
Si vous n'arrivez pas
à amuser les émissaires,
vous leur tirerez
dessus à la place ?
Est-ce cela ?
Encore une fois !
J'ai une affaire à vous confier,
Charles.
Comme d'habitude.
Ma sœur Margaret
va épouser le roi du Portugal.
Je veux que vous l'escortiez,
elle et sa suite, jusqu'à Lisbonne...
... et que vous la donniez en mon nom.
Pourquoi moi ?
J'ai besoin d'un homme de confiance.
Vous me faites confiance
avec les belles femmes ?
Avec ma sœur ?
Bien sûr,
je vous fais confiance.
Pourquoi
ne le ferais-je pas ?
Dans tous les cas,
vous êtes compromis avec...
... quel est son nom ?
Je ne m'en souviens plus !
Elisabeth Grey.
C'est la cousine
du marquis de Dorsey.
Exactement.
Je suis honoré par la confiance de Votre
Majesté, mais il reste une difficulté.
Je ne suis pas assez important,
pour donner la sœur d'un roi.
Surtout celle du roi d'Angleterre.
C'est pourquoi je vous fais Duc.
Duc de Suffolk.
Comment trouvez-vous cela,
votre grâce ?
L'Empereur envoie
ses meilleurs vœux au roi.
Nous vous sommes
très reconnaissants,
de venir nous accueillir en personne.
Tout l'honneur est pour moi.
Sa Majesté considère votre visite
comme un grand moment.
Quand aurons-nous audience
avec Sa Majesté ?
Laissez-moi vous conseiller à ce propos.
Il n'y a qu'un seul moyen
de rencontrer le roi.
C'est d'être dans les bons offices
du Cardinal Wolsey.
Nous avons eu vent, M. More,
que le cardinal Wolsey
défend les intérêts français.
Seulement lorsqu'il les considère
identiques aux nôtres.
Dites-moi, quelle est l'attitude
de l'Empereur face
à la hausse des hérétiques luthériens
sur une partie de son territoire ?
Mon ami Erasme m'a dit qu'en Allemagne,
ils se propagent comme un feu de forêt.
Son Altesse fait tout ce qui est
en son pouvoir pour les supprimer.
Mais vous savez que Luther lui-même
est l'invité d'un prince allemand.
Il est malheureusement
hors de son contrôle.
Mon roi rédige un pamphlet,
démolissant les arguments de Luther,
défendant la papauté...
... et notre foi.
Vous voulez dire...
qu'il le rédige lui-même ?
De ses propres mains ?
Non...
Il y a beaucoup de grandes choses
que mon roi peut faire.
Les émissaires de l'Empereur,
Votre Éminence.
Vos Excellences...
Ceci est, en effet, un jour heureux.
Nous avons prévu
de nombreuses festivités
afin d'honorer votre visite.
Et c'est mon vœu et désir,
qu'ensemble nous affinions
quelques détails de l'accord,
qui unira nos maîtres
en une amitié perpétuelle.
C'est également notre vœu,
Votre Éminence.
Bien !
Je vous en prie.
Pas vous, Thomas.
Ne perdons ni votre temps ni le mien.
Alors, avant de trinquer,
dites-moi...
Est-ce que l'Empereur est vraiment
sincère quant à ce traité ?
Bien sûr qu'il l'est.
Bien. Je propose donc de le renforcer.
Nous annoncerons également
l'engagement de l'Empereur,
avec la fille du Roi...
la princesse Marie.
Nous avions cru comprendre
qu'elle était déjà promise au Dauphin.
Mais maintenant
elle est promise à Charles.
À moins que vous n'ayez une objection.
Bien au contraire.
Bien... Nous sommes donc d'accord.
L'Empereur nous a demandé d'informer
votre Éminence, personnellement,
qu'il désire vous accorder
une pension très généreuse.
Il pèsera aussi, de tout son poids
pour vos ambitions dans la papauté.
Buvons, au succès de la visite
de Vos Excellences.
Par tous les moyens.
Vous avez trouvé le moyen
de mettre ma nièce devant le roi ?
Oui, Votre Grâce.
C'est déjà arrangé.
Anne apparaîtra lors de la pièce
pour les envoyés espagnols,
où le roi sera présent.
Elle trouvera un moyen
d'attirer son attention.
Bien.
Une fois qu'elle aura ouvert ses cuisses
pour lui, elle pourra ouvrir la bouche...
... et dénoncer Wolsey.
On dit que les épées les plus aiguisées
vont dans les fourreaux les plus doux.
Son Éminence, le cardinal Wolsey
et les ambassadeurs espagnols...
Mendoza et Chapuis.
Qui sont ces jeunes femmes ?
Ce sont les grâces, votre excellence
Elles ont des noms comme,
"Bonté", "Honneur",
"Constance", "Compassion"
et "Pitié".
Elles sont prisonnières au château.
Celle qui est à gauche,
sous les cœurs brisés...
... est la sœur de Sa Majesté.
Princesse Margaret.
Qui les retient en prison ?
"Danger", "Jalousie",
"Méchanceté", "Dédain",
"Désordre" et "Étrangeté"
et d'autres du même genre.
Est ce que le roi est parmi eux ?
Lequel est le roi ?
Ces hommes représentent "Jeunesse",
"Dévotion", "Loyauté",
"Plaisir", "Chevalerie" et "Liberté"
et effectivement, le roi est parmi eux.
Moi, Désir Ardent, je demande
que vous relâchiez vos prisonnières.
Moi, Dame Dédain,
je ris de vos désirs.
Ces hommes sont de nobles seigneurs.
Non, ce ne sont que
des hommes déguisés.
Je le répète encore.
Libérez ces demoiselles
que vous retenez si cruellement.
Jamais !
Vous ne me laissez aucun choix, que
d'attaquer et de briser vos défenses.
Aucun chevalier ne brisera
jamais les miennes.
Lady, Désir surmonte tout.
Attaque !
Persévérance, vous êtes
maintenant ma prisonnière.
Ma sœur.
Mon frère.
Et maintenant, vous devez tous
vous démasquer.
Je dois vous parler.
Je suis sûr que vous avez réglé
toutes vos affaires ici, Margaret.
Oui, mais...
Le roi m'a dit tout l'amour
qu'il a pour vous
Il désire vous rencontrer en personne
depuis qu'il a vu votre portrait.
Je vous en supplie,
en tant que sœur.
Ne m'obligez pas à l'épouser,
c'est un vieil homme.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Anne...
Anne Boleyn.
Merci, Maître Cornish,
je vous suis très reconnaissant.
Sir Thomas.
Puis-je voir votre maîtresse ?
Un gentleman, Milady.
M. Brandon.
Vous n'êtes pas encore
investi Duc, n'est-ce pas ?
Non, madame.
Je dois emmener avec moi au Portugal
une suite de 200 personnes,
incluant mon chambellan, mon aumônier,
ma costumière et toutes mes servantes.
Si vous avez quelque chose à en dire,
vous verrez cela avec mon chambellan.
Oui, madame.
Je suis surprise que mon frère ait
choisi quelqu'un dépourvu de sang noble
pour le représenter.
Même Norfolk aurait été préférable.
M. Pace, la reine est prête.
Je vais vous annoncer à la reine.
Sa Majesté Catherine d'Aragon,
Reine d'Angleterre.
Votre Majesté,
les émissaires d'Espagne.
Je sais que vous avez
une audience avec le roi,
Mais je ne pouvais vous laisser
passer sans vous rencontrer.
Votre Majesté.
Votre neveu, l'Empereur, vous envoie
son amour et son respect filial.
Toujours.
Dites-lui, que s'il m'aime,
il devrait m'écrire plus souvent.
Mais je suis heureuse
du plus profond de mon cœur,
que vous soyez ici,
et qu'un traité soit
en train de voir le jour.
Ambassadeur,
méfiez-vous du Cardinal.
Sa Majesté va vous recevoir
maintenant.
Messieurs.
Bienvenus dans mon royaume.
Je sais que vous réussirez dans vos
efforts pour négocier un traité réussi.
Vous devez croire tout ce que
le Cardinal Wolsey vous dit.
Il parle directement en mon nom.
Dans tous les cas.
Pour ma part, je voudrais
inviter l'Empereur à nous rendre visite.
Aussitôt que vous pourrez l'arranger.
Cette visite nous apportera du plaisir,
aussi bien à moi...
... qu'à ma Reine.
Votre Majesté.
Quand arrive-t-il ?
À la fin de ce mois.
Aussi vite !
S'ils ont besoin d'alliés
contre les Français,
je peux rassembler des troupes
très rapidement.
En effet. Les émissaires
m'ont confié, en secret,
que l'Empereur attaquera en premier,
l'occupation française en Italie.
Il réclame le Duché de Milan.
Et après ?
Après les avoir renvoyés d'Italie,
avec votre aide,
il envahira la France.
Je veux que vous prépariez toutes
nos forces pour une invasion conjointe.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Et je veux un autre navire de guerre.
Votre Majesté,
nous venons juste de finir le "Victory".
Alors, commandez-en un autre !
Un plus grand.
Ce que nous manquons en hommes,
nous pouvons le gagner en bateaux.
Nous sommes une race
d'îliens, Cardinal.
Nous avons les meilleurs
et les plus braves marins du monde.
J'aurais la plus grande flotte.
Les bateaux de guerre sont chers.
Mon père était un homme prévoyant.
Un homme astucieux.
Un homme d'affaires.
Il m'a laissé beaucoup d'argent,
votre éminence.
J'entends le dépenser.
Bien.
Sir Thomas Boleyn.
Sir Thomas !
Majesté.
Approchez.
Je crois avoir été un peu ingrat.
Je ne vous ai pas montré ma gratitude
pour tout les efforts diplomatiques
- Que vous avez réalisé en mon nom.
- Votre Majesté n'en a nul besoin.
Je suis content de vous servir, avec
toutes les capacités dont je peux user.
Quoi qu'il en soit,
je veux vous montrer
ma gratitude.
Il me plaît de vous faire
"Chevalier de la Jarretière."
Je vous nomme aussi,
"Contrôleur de ma demeure."
Je suis sûr que Votre Majesté a...
... une meilleure opinion
de mes talents que moi.
Je suis seul juge de cela.
Nous en reparlerons plus tard.
Oh, j'ai failli oublier.
Votre fille,
celle qui a participé à la mascarade.
- Anne.
- Oui !
En fait, elle va bientôt
rejoindre la cour.
Comme dame de compagnie
de Sa Majesté.
<i>Château Hever
Demeure de la famille Boleyn</i>
<i>Et me quitterez-vous ainsi ?</i>
<i>Dites non, dites non,
à la honte.</i>
<i>Te sauver du péché, de toute ma peine
et de tout mon dégoût.</i>
<i>Et me quitterez-vous alors ?</i>
<i>Dites non, dites non.</i>
<i>Et me quitterez-vous ainsi ?</i>
<i>Et vous n'aurez plus de pitié
pour celui qui vous aime.</i>
<i>À part votre cruauté.</i>
<i>Et me quitterez-vous ainsi ?</i>
<i>Dites non, dites non.</i>
Bien, vous avez aimé ?
Puis-je aimer quelque chose,
qui m'accuse de cruauté.
Vous êtes cruelle, Mlle Anne.
Le suis-je ?
Vous n'avez aucun droit sur moi,
Maître Wyatt.
J'ai le même droit
que tout autre amoureux,
vers lequel, le cœur d'une femme
se soumet librement.
Vous êtes un poète,
comme je suis une femme.
Les poètes et les femmes sont toujours
libres dans leurs amours, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui.
Arrêtez Thomas.
J'avais donc raison.
Vous me quittez.
Pourquoi ne répondez-vous pas ?
Vous êtes marié.
Oui... mais je suis séparé.
Je vais divorcer.
Je veux dire,
qui n'est pas marié ?
Vous ne devez plus chercher à me voir.
Promettez-le-moi.
Pourquoi le ferais-je ?
Quand je sais déjà
ce que les promesses coûtent.
Il y a quelqu'un d'autre ?
Est-ce cela ?
Vous en aimez un autre ?
Ne demandez jamais après moi.
Et ne parlez jamais, si vous tenez
à la vie, de moi à d'autres.
Comprenez-vous ?
N'avez-vous aucune pitié ?
Imagine...
Imagine comment il va
agir maintenant.
Je parie qu'il a déjà commandé
un costume plus grand !
Oui, Votre Grâce.
Non, Votre Grâce.
Laissez-moi récolter vos pets
et les vendre en nectar, Votre Grâce.
Je ne veux plus y penser.
Ça me rend malade.
Alors, que faisons-nous ?
Trouvons des femmes !
Même si c'est une vraie Vénus,
je ne pourrais la satisfaire dans mon état.
- Alors, continuons de boire !
- Très bien.
À la santé de Sa Grâce !
Oui, à Charles !
Sa Grâce !
Est-ce que les émissaires
sont partis satisfaits ?
Ils avaient un excellent esprit.
Le traité est accepté.
Quand mon neveu vient-il ?
Nous attendons les nouvelles.
Wolsey s'en occupera.
J'ai fait un rêve.
Dans mon rêve, vous...
reveniez me voir à nouveau et
me serriez dans vos bras,
et vous...
me murmuriez que
tout irait bien, et...
que de toute façon
tout irait bien.
Henri...
Mon chéri.
Mon époux.
Vous devez me croire.
je n'ai jamais connu votre frère...
de cette manière.
Il était si jeune et
il était malade.
Je n'ai jamais connu
un autre homme.
Et je n'en ai jamais voulu.
Je vous aime.
<i>Le Roi !</i>
Voudriez-vous rejoindre le Roi
dans sa chambre ?
Marie.
Ma fille chérie.
Mon ciel !
Avez-vous dit vos prières ?
Oui.
Mon Seigneur.
Comment cela vous plairait-il ?
Est-ce que... le Roi a envoyé,
un message ou un signe,
disant qu'il allait
me rendre visite cette nuit ?
Non, Milady.
Non.
Je suis inquiète pour vous,
mon amour.
Vous travaillez trop dur.
Je le sais.
Il vous tuera !
Je le sais aussi...
Mais que puis-je y faire ?
Restez vivant.
- Ne venez-vous pas ?
- Que se passe-t-il ?
Les nouvelles dames
de la Reine arrivent.
Venez.
Maîtresse... Maîtresse...
La manière dont elle se tient...
"Quel serpent a été aussi venimeux
pour nommer la ville sacrée
de Rome, Babylone
et l'autorité du Pape, tyrannie,
et changer le nom
de notre Saint-Père en Antéchrist."
C'est très bien.
Des mots forts,
mais c'est très bien.
Êtes-vous sûr ?
En fait, vous devriez modérer
légèrement la polémique.
Par exemple, vous traitez Luther
de... mauvaise herbe.
Où est-ce ?
Ah, ici...
"Ce malade dépravé,
à l'esprit diabolique."
Réduire le ton ?
Oh, oui pour...
... pour des raisons diplomatiques.
Non, jamais.
Aucun langage n'est assez fort
pour condamner Luther,
ni assez gracieux
pour louer sa Sainteté.
Je lui dédierais une copie,
et vous la lui porterez à Rome.
Pourquoi moi ?
S'il y a quelque chose
de vrai et de bon dans cela,
ce sera grâce à vous.
Je n'aurais jamais pu l'écrire,
où autre chose de semblable,
Sir Thomas More,
sans vos conseils
et votre infaillible honnêteté.
Pourquoi m'avoir appelé Sir Thomas ?
Chevalier,
c'est le moins que je puisse faire.
C'est plus que je ne mérite.
Non, ne soyez pas
trop modeste, Thomas.
Vous n'êtes pas un saint.
Il ya autre chose que je voudrais
que vous fassiez pour moi.
Saisissez toutes les copies du travail
de Luther que vous trouverez.
Et brûlez-les.
Brûlez-les tous.
De France.
Eh bien, le Roi François
a déjà découvert
notre rapprochement
avec l'Empereur.
Il se sent trahi et fâché
et menace nos intérêts.
Qui lui a dit ?
<i>Croix de St. Paul

<i>Milords et Miladies,</i>
<i>Son Altesse Impériale, Charles,
Saint Empereur Romain.</i>
<i>Roi d'Aragon, Valence,
Naples et de Sicile.</i>

Votre Éminence, un moment...
Éloignez-vous, M. Pace.
Éloignez-vous.
Oui, Votre Éminence.
Votre Altesse.
Votre Majesté.
Je ne m'y attendais pas !
Je ne pouvais contenir mon attente.
Je tenais à venir, en personne,
pour vous accueillir.
J'en suis vraiment honoré.
Bienvenue.
Ce soir, nous danserons
et festoierons.
Et demain, je vous
ferais voir mes bateaux.
Messieurs.
Musique !
Allons célébrer !
Venez !
Arrêtez cet homme.
Attendez !
Non, attendez... attendez !
Ah, M. Pace !
Vous saviez, bien sûr,
que sa Majesté
allait faire cette visite surprise,
n'est-ce pas ?
En fait, oui. Étant son secrétaire,
il est évident que je le sache.
Oui, bien sûr, vous le saviez.
Et vous saviez bien sûr,
que les émissaires impériaux, venait,
en privé, pour s'allier avec sa Majesté.
Et bien sûr, vous parlez
espagnol, n'est-ce pas ?
Presque aussi bien
que vous parlez français.
Je... Je ne comprends pas,
Votre Éminence.
Oh, je pense que si, M. Pace.
Je pense vraiment que si,
parce que, voyez-vous,
je crois que vous n'êtes
pas juste mon espion,
mais que vous êtes également
l'espion des Français.
Non, cela n'est pas vrai !
Vous êtes démis
de toutes vos fonctions.
Non, attendez... attendez,
je vous jure...
je jure sur tout ce qui est sacré,
que cela n'est pas vrai !
Sa Majesté est au plus
profond de mon cœur.
C'est une trahison,
de comploter contre sa Majesté.
Attendez...
Que dites-vous ?
Attendez Votre Éminence,
ne faites pas cela...
Vous savez que c'est faux...
Votre Éminence, pitié,
je vous en supplie...
Vous savez que c'est faux...
Votre Éminence, pitié, pitié...
Celui-ci est mon vaisseau amiral,
"Le Marie-Rose".
C'est le plus grand vaisseau
de la flotte.
Il tire 700 tonneaux...
Est armé de 91 canons...
Et à une compagnie
de 400 hommes.
Je n'ai rien de comparable.
Vous avez une grande armée.
À nous deux,
nous serons invincibles.
Comment les Français
pourraient-ils nous résister ?
Avec vous à mes côtés,
il n'y a plus de limites,
de frontières ou de monde,
que l'on ne pourra conquérir.
Je vous apprécie déjà !
À part le menton,
qu'est-ce qu'il n'y
a pas à apprécier ?
<i>La Porte des Traîtres

Prisonnier à l'entrée.
Vous devez me croire,
je suis un innocent,
je ne sais pas pourquoi
on m'a envoyé ici.
Je suis innocent !
Non non non,
je n'ai rien fait de mal !
Je n'ai rien fait de mal...
Vous savez, vous et moi sommes unis
par un lien indissoluble.
Puisque vous avez épousé
la sœur de ma mère,
vous êtes vraiment mon oncle.
C'est une affinité qui m'honore
et me plaît... neveu !
Votre Altesse,
votre tante vous attend.
<i>Votre Majesté, son Altesse Impériale,</i>
<i>Charles, Saint Empereur Romain.</i>
Majesté, je demande votre bénédiction,
comme un neveu à sa tante.
Je vous donne librement
ma bénédiction, mon cher Charles.
Comme je vous donne mon amour.
Votre Altesse.
Permettez-moi
de vous présenter ma fille, Marie.
Votre future mariée !
Bravo !
Venez !
Nous devrons attendre d'être mariés.
Pensez-vous en avoir la patience ?
J'ai un présent pour votre Altesse.
Voulez-vous le voir ?
J'adore les présents.
Montrez-le-moi.
Là-bas, regardez !
Sont-ils pour moi ?
Vous les aimez ?
C'est le plus beau présent
que j'ai eu.
Merci, votre Altesse.
Dès que vous le pourrez, venez,
tous les deux, me rendre visite.
Je veux spécialement vous montrer,
le trésor de Montezuma,
Roi des Aztèques,
que le général Cortez,
a récemment découvert au Mexique.
- Nous aimerions bien cela.
- Oui.
Nous savons peu de cette terre
au-delà des mers, appelée "Les Indes".
Je vous le dis, je vous jure que
c'est là où l'avenir se trouve.
Tant de terres inexplorées,
tant de richesse en or,
argent, minéraux et sel.
Madame.
Ma chérie.
Mettez-vous dans son chemin !
Comment vont les préparatifs ?
Nous recrutons plus
de mercenaires germains, mais...
... tout va bien.
Je prendrais Milan
le printemps prochain.
Et après ?
Et après, tous les deux,
nous envahirons la France,
et mettrons fin à l'aventure, de ce...
monarque libertin, le roi François.
Cela me rendrait très heureux.
Et ferait aussi de vous
le Roi de France.
Oui.
Bravo ! Bravo !
Encore ! Encore !
Voulez-vous danser, Votre Altesse ?
Oh, avec la permission
de Vos Majestés.
Accordé.
Excusez-moi.
Le Roi du Portugal, j'ai aussi entendu
dire qu'il avait la goutte.
On dit que sa colonne est déformée.
Il marche comme un crabe.
Faites-moi une promesse, mon frère.
J'accepte de l'épouser,
mais à une seule condition.
Quand il sera mort,
ce que j'espère rapidement,
je pourrais épouser
celui que je choisis.
Entendu ?
Tu ne bois pas, aujourd'hui, Charles ?
Ou dois-je dire Votre Grâce ?
Tu devrais l'appeler
par son vrai nom,
qui est con ou vilain.
Pourquoi ?
Nous sommes supposés
être amis, Charles.
Ne le sommes-nous pas ?
Pas si tu ne nous
montres pas de faveur.
Tu pourrais dire à Sa Majesté
qu'il nous donne quelques titres,
ou au moins quelques terres.
Il semble que tout ce que le roi
peut donner, il te l'a déjà donné.
Jaloux ?
Naturellement !
Si tu t'élèves, nous le devons aussi.
Alors, que pouvons-nous
faire pour vous, Votre Grâce ?
Montrez-moi plus de respect.
Bravo !
Merci.
Je suis si contente de vous voir.
Je me sens si seule, ici.
Seule ?
Les choses ne vont pas bien
entre Sa Majesté et moi.
Mais... J'ai vu de mes propres yeux
comme il est attentionné avec vous.
Il vous regarde avec dévotion.
Il m'a semblé éprouver un tel amour.
J'ai peur que cela ne soit
pour votre seul bénéfice.
Henri est un bon acteur.
Je ne veux plus
en entendre parler !
Lady Anne.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Je pense parfois,
qu'il va me demander de divorcer.
Un divorce ?
Non, cela est impossible.
L'est-il ?
Pardonnez-moi.
Anne.
Non, pas de la sorte !
Comment ?
Séduisez-moi !
Écrivez des lettres pour moi.
Et des poèmes.
J'aime les poèmes.
Envoûtez-moi de vos mots.
Séduisez-moi !
Votre Majesté !
Ce n'est rien.
Elle est partie.
À Vos Majestés, pour signer
entre vous deux ce traité
d'amitié et de concorde perpétuelle.
À confirmer de vos sceaux
et devant ces témoins,
l'engagement de Charles,
Saint Empereur Romain,
avec son Altesse, Princesse Marie,
quand elle aura atteint ses douze ans.
Je vous le répète à nouveau,
selon mes pouvoirs de représentant
du Pape et de Chancelier d'Angleterre,
vous devrez signer ce traité d'amitié,
l'un envers l'autre,
et vous ne le briserez jamais.
Ou que Dieu vous aide.
Je vous jure,
mon honneur et ma loyauté.
Vous devrez toujours
me faire confiance.
Toujours.
Où est M. Pace ?
Il devait être là.
Votre Majesté, j'ai découvert,
malheureusement,
que M. Pace ne méritait plus
la confiance de Votre Majesté.
Je l'ai démis de ses fonctions.
En êtes-vous sûr ?
Les Français lui versaient une pension.
Je vois.
Je vous fais confiance
pour trouver un remplaçant.
Alors ?
Comment se déroulent nos affaires ?
Très bien, Votre Grâce.
Le Roi ne montre pas
de déclarations évidentes d'intérêt,
mais il est possible de le détecter,
par la manière qu'il a de la regarder.
Comme si, dans son esprit,
il pouvait la voir... dénudée.
C'est ainsi qu'il regarde
toutes les jeunes femmes.
Mais c'est un début.
Le commencement, au moins,
de la fin de cet insupportable prélat.
Tout vient à temps.
Une chose après l'autre.
Peut-être serait-il judicieux d'inclure
le Duc de Suffolk dans nos plans ?
Charles Brandon ?
Il est à peine gentleman !
C'est le meilleur ami du Roi.
Et je suis sûr qu'il hait Wolsey
autant que nous.
Il serait un allié naturel.
Au moins pour un temps !
<i>Atteint !</i>
<i>Deux points pour M. Anthony Knivert.</i>
M. Hayes...
Avez-vous les pièces
que j'ai demandées ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Le premier, rubis monté sur
des cercles en or.
Le second, une pierre précieuse
surmontant un lit d'or et de perles.
Le troisième, petites et grandes perles,
en gouttes, avec de l'or et du pourpre,
et le détail d'une tête de lion.
Et le dernier,
plumes d'argent, d'or et d'ambre.
Des bijoux faits pour une reine,
Votre Majesté.
C'était Wolsey...
C'était Wolsey, pas moi !
Écoutez-moi, c'est Wolsey qui recevait
une pension des Français, pas moi...
Écoutez-moi, je n'ai rien fait,
je suis innocent.
C'était Wolsey, Wolsey...
Demandez-lui !
Demandez-lui !
C'était Wolsey...

Il y aura un sommet entre
le roi de France et le roi Henri.
Puis-je demander au roi d'Angleterre,
de signer le traité de paix
universelle et perpétuelle ?
Vous donnez ma fille au Dauphin
et à la France sans m'avoir consultée.
C'est à moi de dire
ce qui est souhaitable.
Je vois la main de Wolsey,
derrière cela.
Quel arrangement avez-vous
conclu avec Wolsey ?
En échange de la paix
entre nos deux pays,
je lui ai promis le vote français.
Le fait est que Wolsey
va rencontrer le nouvel Empereur.
De toute évidence, ils veulent
rompre le traité avec votre roi.
Je suis désolé d'apprendre que
le cardinal Rossini a été élu pape.
Tant qu'il y aura de la corruption
au sein de l'Église,
cet hérétique, Luther, continuera
à gagner des disciples.
Peut-être avez-vous une trop
grande opinion de moi, Thomas.
Le neveu de la reine a été élu.
Il n'est plus seulement
Charles V, roi d'Espagne,
mais il est aussi
le Saint Empereur Romain.
Assurez-vous de traiter avec lui
et non pas avec les français.
Buckingham m'a dit que sa majesté
n'a pas d'héritier,
et qu'il accédera au trône
en assassinant Sa Majesté.
Votre Grâce est arrêtée,
pour suspicion de trahison.
C'est votre œuvre !
Tout cela est votre œuvre !
Et mon enfant ?
C'est au roi de décider
s'il reconnaît l'enfant.
À mon fils !
Je vous en prie, je vous implore...
Donnez-moi un enfant.
Un fils qui occupera mon ventre vide.
Sa Majesté est lassée de votre sœur.
Il ne l'invite plus dans sa couche.
On dit toutes que ses liaisons
ne durent pas.
Chérie, peut-être pourriez-vous
imaginer un moyen
de maintenir son intérêt
plus longtemps ?

Essayons encore une fois.
Tout le monde !
Fermez la porte.
Concentrez-vous, s'il vous plaît !
Tout le monde est prêt ?!
Attaquez !
Mais allez-y, attaquez !
C'est assez, tout le monde.
Arrêtez...
Arrêtez !
Avez-vous une idée
du coût de cette production ?
Pensez-vous vraiment,
que Sa Majesté serait contente
de dépenser une petite fortune...
... pour une aussi
grande porcherie ?
Qui a tiré au mousquet, hum ?
Je crois que c'est moi,
M. Cornish, Sir.
Qu'essayez-vous de faire ?
Si vous n'arrivez pas
à amuser les émissaires,
vous leur tirerez
dessus à la place ?
Est-ce cela ?
Encore une fois !
J'ai une affaire à vous confier,
Charles.
Comme d'habitude.
Ma sœur Margaret
va épouser le roi du Portugal.
Je veux que vous l'escortiez,
elle et sa suite, jusqu'à Lisbonne...
... et que vous la donniez en mon nom.
Pourquoi moi ?
J'ai besoin d'un homme de confiance.
Vous me faites confiance
avec les belles femmes ?
Avec ma sœur ?
Bien sûr,
je vous fais confiance.
Pourquoi
ne le ferais-je pas ?
Dans tous les cas,
vous êtes compromis avec...
... quel est son nom ?
Je ne m'en souviens plus !
Elisabeth Grey.
C'est la cousine
du marquis de Dorsey.
Exactement.
Je suis honoré par la confiance de Votre
Majesté, mais il reste une difficulté.
Je ne suis pas assez important,
pour donner la sœur d'un roi.
Surtout celle du roi d'Angleterre.
C'est pourquoi je vous fais Duc.
Duc de Suffolk.
Comment trouvez-vous cela,
votre grâce ?
L'Empereur envoie
ses meilleurs vœux au roi.
Nous vous sommes
très reconnaissants,
de venir nous accueillir en personne.
Tout l'honneur est pour moi.
Sa Majesté considère votre visite
comme un grand moment.
Quand aurons-nous audience
avec Sa Majesté ?
Laissez-moi vous conseiller à ce propos.
Il n'y a qu'un seul moyen
de rencontrer le roi.
C'est d'être dans les bons offices
du Cardinal Wolsey.
Nous avons eu vent, M. More,
que le cardinal Wolsey
défend les intérêts français.
Seulement lorsqu'il les considère
identiques aux nôtres.
Dites-moi, quelle est l'attitude
de l'Empereur face
à la hausse des hérétiques luthériens
sur une partie de son territoire ?
Mon ami Erasme m'a dit qu'en Allemagne,
ils se propagent comme un feu de forêt.
Son Altesse fait tout ce qui est
en son pouvoir pour les supprimer.
Mais vous savez que Luther lui-même
est l'invité d'une prince allemand.
Il est malheureusement
hors de son contrôle.
Mon roi rédige un pamphlet,
démolissant les arguments de Luther,
défendant la papauté...
... et notre foi.
Vous voulez dire...
qu'il le rédige lui-même ?
De ses propres mains ?
Non...
Il y a beaucoup de grandes choses
que mon roi peut faire.
Les émissaires de l'Empereur,
Votre Éminence.
Vos Excellences...
Ceci est, en effet, un jour heureux.
Nous avons prévu
de nombreuses festivités
afin d'honorer votre visite.
Et c'est mon vœu et désir,
qu'ensemble nous affinions
quelques détails de l'accord,
qui unira nos maîtres
en une amitié perpétuelle.
C'est également notre vœu,
Votre Éminence.
Bien !
Je vous en prie.
Pas vous, Thomas.
Ne perdons ni votre temps ni le mien.
Alors, avant de trinquer,
dites-moi...
Est-ce que l'Empereur est vraiment
sincère quant à ce traité ?
Bien sûr qu'il l'est.
Bien. Je propose donc de le renforcer.
Nous annoncerons également
l'engagement de l'Empereur,
avec la fille du Roi...
la princesse Marie.
Nous avions cru comprendre
qu'elle était déjà promise au Dauphin.
Mais maintenant
elle est promise à Charles.
À moins que vous n'ayez une objection.
Bien au contraire.
Bien... Nous sommes donc d'accord.
L'Empereur nous a demandé d'informer
votre Éminence, personnellement,
qu'il désire vous accorder
une pension très généreuse.
Il pèsera aussi, de tout son poids
pour vos ambitions dans la papauté.
Buvons, au succès de la visite
de Vos Excellences.
Par tous les moyens.
Vous avez trouvé le moyen
de mettre ma nièce devant le roi ?
Oui, Votre Grâce.
C'est déjà arrangé.
Anne apparaîtra lors de la pièce
pour les envoyés espagnols,
où le roi sera présent.
Elle trouvera un moyen
d'attirer son attention.
Bien.
Une fois qu'elle aura ouvert ses cuisses
pour lui, elle pourra ouvrir la bouche...
... et dénoncer Wolsey.
On dit que les épées les plus aiguisées
vont dans les fourreaux les plus doux.
Son Éminence, le cardinal Wolsey
et les ambassadeurs espagnols...
Mendoza et Chapuis.
Qui sont ces jeunes femmes ?
Ce sont les grâces, votre excellence
Elles ont des noms comme,
"Bonté", "Honneur",
"Constance", "Compassion"
et "Pitié".
Elles sont prisonnières au château.
Celle qui est à gauche,
sous les cœurs brisés...
... est la sœur de Sa Majesté.
Princesse Margaret.
Qui les retient en prison ?
"Danger", "Jalousie",
"Méchanceté", "Dédain",
"Désordre" et "Étrangeté"
et d'autres du même genre.
Est ce que le roi est parmi eux ?
Lequel est le roi ?
Ces hommes représentent "Jeunesse",
"Dévotion", "Loyauté",
"Plaisir", "Chevalerie" et "Liberté"
et effectivement, le roi est parmi eux.
Moi, Désir Ardent, je demande
que vous relâchiez vos prisonnières.
Moi, Dame Dédain,
je ris de vos désirs.
Ces hommes sont de nobles seigneurs.
Non, ce ne sont que
des hommes déguisés.
Je le répète encore.
Libérez ces demoiselles
que vous retenez si cruellement.
Jamais !
Vous ne me laissez aucun choix, que
d'attaquer et de briser vos défenses.
Aucun chevalier ne brisera
jamais les miennes.
Lady, Désir surmonte tout.
Attaque !
Persévérance, vous êtes
maintenant ma prisonnière.
Ma sœur.
Mon frère.
Et maintenant, vous devez tous
vous démasquer.
Je dois vous parler.
Je suis sûr que vous avez réglé
toutes vos affaires ici, Margaret.
Oui, mais...
Le roi m'a dit tout l'amour
qu'il a pour vous
Il désire vous rencontrer en personne
depuis qu'il a vu votre portrait.
Je vous en supplie,
en tant que sœur.
Ne m'obligez pas à l'épouser,
c'est un vieil homme.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Anne...
Anne Boleyn.
Merci, Maître Cornish,
je vous suis très reconnaissant.
Sir Thomas.
Puis-je voir votre maîtresse ?
Un gentleman, Milady.
M. Brandon.
Vous n'êtes pas encore
investi Duc, n'est-ce pas ?
Non, madame.
Je dois emmener avec moi au Portugal
une suite de 200 personnes,
incluant mon chambellan, mon aumônier,
ma costumière et toutes mes servantes.
Si vous avez quelque chose à en dire,
vous verrez cela avec mon chambellan.
Oui, madame.
Je suis surprise que mon frère ait
choisi quelqu'un dépourvu de sang noble
pour le représenter.
Même Norfolk aurait été préférable.
M. Pace, la reine est prête.
Je vais vous annoncer à la reine.
Sa Majesté Catherine d'Aragon,
Reine d'Angleterre.
Votre Majesté,
les émissaires d'Espagne.
Je sais que vous avez
une audience avec le roi,
Mais je ne pouvais vous laisser
passer sans vous rencontrer.
Votre Majesté.
Votre neveu, l'Empereur, vous envoie
son amour et son respect filial.
Toujours.
Dites-lui, que s'il m'aime,
il devrait m'écrire plus souvent.
Mais je suis heureuse
du plus profond de mon cœur,
que vous soyez ici,
et qu'un traité soit
en train de voir le jour.
Ambassadeur,
méfiez-vous du Cardinal.
Sa Majesté va vous recevoir
maintenant.
Messieurs.
Bienvenus dans mon royaume.
Je sais que vous réussirez dans vos
efforts pour négocier un traité réussi.
Vous devez croire tout ce que
le Cardinal Wolsey vous dit.
Il parle directement en mon nom.
Dans tous les cas.
Pour ma part, je voudrais
inviter l'Empereur à nous rendre visite.
Aussitôt que vous pourrez l'arranger.
Cette visite nous apportera du plaisir,
aussi bien à moi...
... qu'à ma Reine.
Votre Majesté.
Quand arrive-t-il ?
À la fin de ce mois.
Aussi vite !
S'ils ont besoin d'alliés
contre les Français,
je peux rassembler des troupes
très rapidement.
En effet. Les émissaires
m'ont confié, en secret,
que l'Empereur attaquera en premier,
l'occupation française en Italie.
Il réclame le Duché de Milan.
Et après ?
Après les avoir renvoyés d'Italie,
avec votre aide,
il envahira la France.
Je veux que vous prépariez toutes
nos forces pour une invasion conjointe.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Et je veux un autre navire de guerre.
Votre Majesté,
nous venons juste de finir le "Victory".
Alors, commandez-en un autre !
Un plus grand.
Ce que nous manquons en hommes,
nous pouvons le gagner en bateaux.
Nous sommes une race
d'îliens, Cardinal.
Nous avons les meilleurs
et les plus braves marins du monde.
J'aurais la plus grande flotte.
Les bateaux de guerre sont chers.
Mon père était un homme prévoyant.
Un homme astucieux.
Un homme d'affaires.
Il m'a laissé beaucoup d'argent,
votre éminence.
J'entends le dépenser.
Bien.
Sir Thomas Boleyn.
Sir Thomas !
Majesté.
Approchez.
Je crois avoir été un peu ingrat.
Je ne vous ai pas montré ma gratitude
pour tout les efforts diplomatiques
- Que vous avez réalisé en mon nom.
- Votre Majesté n'en a nul besoin.
Je suis content de vous servir, avec
toutes les capacités dont je peux user.
Quoi qu'il en soit,
je veux vous montrer
ma gratitude.
Il me plaît de vous faire
"Chevalier de la Jarretière."
Je vous nomme aussi,
"Contrôleur de ma demeure."
Je suis sûr que Votre Majesté a...
... une meilleure opinion
de mes talents que moi.
Je suis seul juge de cela.
Nous en reparlerons plus tard.
Oh, j'ai failli oublier.
Votre fille,
celle qui a participé à la mascarade.
- Anne.
- Oui !
En fait, elle va bientôt
rejoindre la cour.
Comme dame de compagnie
de Sa Majesté.

<i>Et me quitterez-vous ainsi ?</i>
<i>Dites non, dites non,
à la honte.</i>
<i>Te sauver du péché, de toute ma peine
et de tout mon dégoût.</i>
<i>Et me quitterez-vous alors ?</i>
<i>Dites non, dites non.</i>
<i>Et me quitterez-vous ainsi ?</i>
<i>Et vous n'aurez plus de pitié
pour celui qui vous aime.</i>
<i>À part votre cruauté.</i>
<i>Et me quitterez-vous ainsi ?</i>
<i>Dites non, dites non.</i>
Bien, vous avez aimé ?
Puis-je aimer quelque chose,
qui m'accuse de cruauté.
Vous êtes cruelle, Mlle Anne.
Le suis-je ?
Vous n'avez aucun droit sur moi,
Maître Wyatt.
J'ai le même droit
que tout autre amoureux,
vers lequel, le cœur d'une femme
se soumet librement.
Vous êtes un poète,
comme je suis une femme.
Les poètes et les femmes sont toujours
libres dans leurs amours, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui.
Arrêtez Thomas.
J'avais donc raison.
Vous me quittez.
Pourquoi ne répondez-vous pas ?
Vous êtes marié.
Oui... mais je suis séparé.
Je vais divorcer.
Je veux dire,
qui n'est pas marié ?
Vous ne devez plus chercher à me voir.
Promettez-le-moi.
Pourquoi le ferais-je ?
Quand je sais déjà
ce que les promesses coûtent.
Il y a quelqu'un d'autre ?
Est-ce cela ?
Vous en aimez un autre ?
Ne demandez jamais après moi.
Et ne parlez jamais, si vous tenez
à la vie, de moi à d'autres.
Comprenez-vous ?
N'avez-vous aucune pitié ?
Imagine...
Imagine comment il va
agir maintenant.
Je parie qu'il a déjà commandé
un costume plus grand !
Oui, Votre Grâce.
Non, Votre Grâce.
Laissez-moi récolter vos pets
et les vendre en nectar, Votre Grâce.
Je ne veux plus y penser.
Ça me rend malade.
Alors, que faisons-nous ?
Trouvons des femmes !
Même si c'est une vraie Vénus,
je ne pourrais la satisfaire dans mon état.
- Alors, continuons de boire !
- Très bien.
À la santé de Sa Grâce !
Oui, à Charles !
Sa Grâce !
Est-ce que les émissaires
sont partis satisfaits ?
Ils avaient un excellent esprit.
Le traité est accepté.
Quand mon neveu vient-il ?
Nous attendons les nouvelles.
Wolsey s'en occupera.
J'ai fait un rêve.
Dans mon rêve, vous...
reveniez me voir à nouveau et
me serriez dans vos bras,
et vous...
me murmuriez que
tout irait bien, et...
que de toute façon
tout irait bien.
Henri...
Mon chéri.
Mon époux.
Vous devez me croire.
je n'ai jamais connu votre frère...
de cette manière.
Il était si jeune et
il était malade.
Je n'ai jamais connu
un autre homme.
Et je n'en ai jamais voulu.
Je vous aime.
<i>Le Roi !</i>
Voudriez-vous rejoindre le Roi
dans sa chambre ?
Marie.
Ma fille chérie.
Mon ciel !
Avez-vous dit vos prières ?
Oui.
Mon Seigneur.
Comment cela vous plairait-il ?
Est-ce que... le Roi a envoyé,
un message ou un signe,
disant qu'il allait
me rendre visite cette nuit ?
Non, Milady.
Non.
Je suis inquiète pour vous,
mon amour.
Vous travaillez trop dur.
Je le sais.
Il vous tuera !
Je le sais aussi...
Mais que puis-je y faire ?
Restez vivant.
- Ne venez-vous pas ?
- Que se passe-t-il ?
Les nouvelles dames
de la Reine arrivent.
Venez.
Maîtresse... Maîtresse...
La manière dont elle se tient...
"Quel serpent a été aussi venimeux
pour nommer la ville sacrée
de Rome, Babylone
et l'autorité du Pape, tyrannie,
et changer le nom
de notre Saint-Père en Antéchrist."
C'est très bien.
Des mots forts,
mais c'est très bien.
Êtes-vous sûr ?
En fait, vous devriez modérer
légèrement la polémique.
Par exemple, vous traitez Luther
de... mauvaise herbe.
Où est-ce ?
Ah, ici...
"Ce malade dépravé,
à l'esprit diabolique."
Réduire le ton ?
Oh, oui pour...
... pour des raisons diplomatiques.
Non, jamais.
Aucun langage n'est assez fort
pour condamner Luther,
ni assez gracieux
pour louer sa Sainteté.
Je lui dédierais une copie,
et vous la lui porterez à Rome.
Pourquoi moi ?
S'il y a quelque chose
de vrai et de bon dans cela,
ce sera grâce à vous.
Je n'aurais jamais pu l'écrire,
où autre chose de semblable,
Sir Thomas More,
sans vos conseils
et votre infaillible honnêteté.
Pourquoi m'avoir appelé Sir Thomas ?
Chevalier,
c'est le moins que je puisse faire.
C'est plus que je ne mérite.
Non, ne soyez pas
trop modeste, Thomas.
Vous n'êtes pas un saint.
Il ya autre chose que je voudrais
que vous fassiez pour moi.
Saisissez toutes les copies du travail
de Luther que vous trouverez.
Et brûlez-les.
Brûlez-les tous.
De France.
Eh bien, le Roi François
a déjà découvert
notre rapprochement
avec l'Empereur.
Il se sent trahi et fâché
et menace nos intérêts.
Qui lui a dit ?

Votre Éminence, un moment...
Éloignez-vous, M. Pace.
Éloignez-vous.
Oui, Votre Éminence.
Votre Altesse.
Votre Majesté.
Je ne m'y attendais pas !
Je ne pouvais contenir mon attente.
Je tenais à venir, en personne,
pour vous accueillir.
J'en suis vraiment honoré.
Bienvenue.
Ce soir, nous danserons
et festoierons.
Et demain, je vous
ferais voir mes bateaux.
Messieurs.
Musique !
Allons célébrer !
Venez !
Arrêtez cet homme.
Attendez !
Non, attendez... attendez !
Ah, M. Pace !
Vous saviez, bien sûr,
que sa Majesté
allait faire cette visite surprise,
n'est-ce pas ?
En fait, oui. Étant son secrétaire,
il est évident que je le sache.
Oui, bien sûr, vous le saviez.
Et vous saviez bien sûr,
que les émissaires impériaux, venait,
en privé, pour s'allier avec sa Majesté.
Et bien sûr, vous parlez
espagnol, n'est-ce pas ?
Presque aussi bien
que vous parlez français.
Je... Je ne comprends pas,
Votre Éminence.
Oh, je pense que si, M. Pace.
Je pense vraiment que si,
parce que, voyez-vous,
je crois que vous n'êtes
pas juste mon espion,
mais que vous êtes également
l'espion des Français.
Non, cela n'est pas vrai !
Vous êtes démis
de toutes vos fonctions.
Non, attendez... attendez,
je vous jure...
je jure sur tout ce qui est sacré,
que cela n'est pas vrai !
Sa Majesté est au plus
profond de mon cœur.
C'est une trahison,
de comploter contre sa Majesté.
Attendez...
Que dites-vous ?
Attendez Votre Éminence,
ne faites pas cela...
Vous savez que c'est faux...
Votre Éminence, pitié,
je vous en supplie...
Vous savez que c'est faux...
Votre Éminence, pitié, pitié...
Celui-ci est mon vaisseau amiral,
"Le Marie-Rose".
C'est le plus grand vaisseau
de la flotte.
Il tire 700 tonneaux...
Est armé de 91 canons...
Et à une compagnie
de 400 hommes.
Je n'ai rien de comparable.
Vous avez une grande armée.
À nous deux,
nous serons invincibles.
Comment les Français
pourraient-ils nous résister ?
Avec vous à mes côtés,
il n'y a plus de limites,
de frontières ou de monde,
que l'on ne pourra conquérir.
Je vous apprécie déjà !
À part le menton,
qu'est-ce qu'il n'y
a pas à apprécier ?

Je suis innocent !

je n'ai rien fait de mal !
Je n'ai rien fait de mal...
Vous savez, vous et moi sommes unis
par un lien indissoluble.
Puisque vous avez épousé
la sœur de ma mère,
vous êtes vraiment mon oncle.
C'est une affinité qui m'honore
et me plaît... neveu !
Votre Altesse,
votre tante vous attend.
<i>Votre Majesté, son Altesse Impériale,</i>
<i>Charles, Saint Empereur Romain.</i>
Majesté, je demande votre bénédiction,
comme un neveu à sa tante.
Je vous donne librement
ma bénédiction, mon cher Charles.
Comme je vous donne mon amour.
Votre Altesse.
Permettez-moi
de vous présenter ma fille, Marie.
Votre future mariée !
Bravo !
Venez !
Nous devrons attendre d'être mariés.
Pensez-vous en avoir la patience ?
J'ai un présent pour votre Altesse.
Voulez-vous le voir ?
J'adore les présents.
Montrez-le-moi.
Là-bas, regardez !
Sont-ils pour moi ?
Vous les aimez ?
C'est le plus beau présent
que j'ai eu.
Merci, votre Altesse.
Dès que vous le pourrez, venez,
tous les deux, me rendre visite.
Je veux spécialement vous montrer,
le trésor de Montezuma,
Roi des Aztèques,
que le général Cortez,
a récemment découvert au Mexique.
- Nous aimerions bien cela.
- Oui.
Nous savons peu de cette terre
au-delà des mers, appelée "Les Indes".
Je vous le dis, je vous jure que
c'est là où l'avenir se trouve.
Tant de terres inexplorées,
tant de richesse en or,
argent, minéraux et sel.
Madame.
Ma chérie.
Mettez-vous dans son chemin !
Comment vont les préparatifs ?
Nous recrutons plus
de mercenaires germains, mais...
... tout va bien.
Je prendrais Milan
le printemps prochain.
Et après ?
Et après, tous les deux,
nous envahirons la France,
et mettrons fin à l'aventure, de ce...
monarque libertin, le roi François.
Cela me rendrait très heureux.
Et ferait aussi de vous
le Roi de France.
Oui.
Bravo ! Bravo !
Encore ! Encore !
Voulez-vous danser, Votre Altesse ?
Oh, avec la permission
de Vos Majestés.
Accordé.
Excusez-moi.
Le Roi du Portugal, j'ai aussi entendu
dire qu'il avait la goutte.
On dit que sa colonne est déformée.
Il marche comme un crabe.
Faites-moi une promesse, mon frère.
J'accepte de l'épouser,
mais à une seule condition.
Quand il sera mort,
ce que j'espère rapidement,
je pourrais épouser
celui que je choisis.
Entendu ?
Tu ne bois pas, aujourd'hui, Charles ?
Ou dois-je dire Votre Grâce ?
Tu devrais l'appeler
par son vrai nom,
qui est con ou vilain.
Pourquoi ?
Nous sommes supposés
être amis, Charles.
Ne le sommes-nous pas ?
Pas si tu ne nous
montres pas de faveur.
Tu pourrais dire à Sa Majesté
qu'il nous donne quelques titres,
ou au moins quelques terres.
Il semble que tout ce que le roi
peut donner, il te l'a déjà donné.
Jaloux ?
Naturellement !
Si tu t'élèves, nous le devons aussi.
Alors, que pouvons-nous
faire pour vous, Votre Grâce ?
Montrez-moi plus de respect.
Bravo !
Merci.
Je suis si contente de vous voir.
Je me sens si seule, ici.
Seule ?
Les choses ne vont pas bien
entre Sa Majesté et moi.
Mais... J'ai vu de mes propres yeux
comme il est attentionné avec vous.
Il vous regarde avec dévotion.
Il m'a semblé éprouver un tel amour.
J'ai peur que cela ne soit
pour votre seul bénéfice.
Henri est un bon acteur.
Je ne veux plus
en entendre parler !
Lady Anne.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Je pense parfois,
qu'il va me demander de divorcer.
Un divorce ?
Non, cela est impossible.
L'est-il ?
Pardonnez-moi.
Anne.
Non, pas de la sorte !
Comment ?
Séduisez-moi !
Écrivez des lettres pour moi.
Et des poèmes.
J'aime les poèmes.
Envoûtez-moi de vos mots.
Séduisez-moi !
Votre Majesté !
Ce n'est rien.
Elle est partie.
À Vos Majestés, pour signer
entre vous deux ce traité
d'amitié et de concorde perpétuelle.
À confirmer de vos sceaux
et devant ces témoins,
l'engagement de Charles,
Saint Empereur Romain,
avec son Altesse, Princesse Marie,
quand elle aura atteint ses douze ans.
Je vous le répète à nouveau,
selon mes pouvoirs de représentant
du Pape et de Chancelier d'Angleterre,
vous devrez signer ce traité d'amitié,
l'un envers l'autre,
et vous ne le briserez jamais.
Ou que Dieu vous aide.
Je vous jure,
mon honneur et ma loyauté.
Vous devrez toujours
me faire confiance.
Toujours.
Où est M. Pace ?
Il devait être là.
Votre Majesté, j'ai découvert,
malheureusement,
que M. Pace ne méritait plus
la confiance de Votre Majesté.
Je l'ai démis de ses fonctions.
En êtes-vous sûr ?
Les Français lui versaient une pension.
Je vois.
Je vous fais confiance
pour trouver un remplaçant.
Alors ?
Comment se déroulent nos affaires ?
Très bien, Votre Grâce.
Le Roi ne montre pas
de déclarations évidentes d'intérêt,
mais il est possible de le détecter,
par la manière qu'il a de la regarder.
Comme si, dans son esprit,
il pouvait la voir... dénudée.
C'est ainsi qu'il regarde
toutes les jeunes femmes.
Mais c'est un début.
Le commencement, au moins,
de la fin de cet insupportable prélat.
Tout vient à temps.
Une chose après l'autre.
Peut-être serait-il judicieux d'inclure
le Duc de Suffolk dans nos plans ?
Charles Brandon ?
Il est à peine gentleman !
C'est le meilleur ami du Roi.
Et je suis sûr qu'il hait Wolsey
autant que nous.
Il serait un allié naturel.
Au moins pour un temps !
<i>Atteint !</i>
<i>Deux points pour M. Anthony Knivert.</i>
M. Hayes...
Avez-vous les pièces
que j'ai demandées ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Le premier, rubis monté sur
des cercles en or.
Le second, une pierre précieuse
surmontant un lit d'or et de perles.
Le troisième, petites et grandes perles,
en gouttes, avec de l'or et du pourpre,
et le détail d'une tête de lion.
Et le dernier,
plumes d'argent, d'or et d'ambre.
Des bijoux faits pour une reine,
Votre Majesté.
C'était Wolsey...
C'était Wolsey, pas moi !
Écoutez-moi, c'est Wolsey qui recevait
une pension des Français, pas moi...
Écoutez-moi, je n'ai rien fait,
je suis innocent.
C'était Wolsey, Wolsey...
Demandez-lui !
Demandez-lui !
C'était Wolsey...
<i>Précédemment dans
"The Tudors"</i>
Vous avez trouvé le moyen
de mettre ma nièce devant le Roi ?
Oui, Votre Grâce.
C'est déjà arrangé.
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Anne Boleyn.
une fois ses cuisses ouvertes,
elle pourra ouvrir sa bouche.
et dénoncer Wolsey.
Ne demandez jamais après moi.
Et ne parlez jamais, si vous tenez
à la vie, de moi à d'autres.
Comprenez-vous ?
Est-ce que l'Empereur est vraiment
sincère quant à ce traité ?
Bien sûr qu'il l'est.
Tous les deux,
nous envahirons la France,
et mettrons fin à l'aventure de ce
monarque libertin, le Roi François.
Les choses ne vont pas bien
entre Sa Majesté et moi.
Je pense parfois,
qu'il va me demander de divorcer.
Cela est impossible.
L'est-il ?
Le Roi m'a dit l'amour
qu'il a pour vous.
Ne m'obligez pas à l'épouser,
c'est un vieil homme.
Ma sœur Margaret
va épouser le Roi du Portugal.
Je veux que vous l'escortiez,
elle et sa suite, jusqu'à Lisbonne...
Je suis surprise que mon frère ait
choisi quelqu'un dépourvu de sang noble
pour le représenter.
Vous me faites confiance
avec les belles femmes ?
Bien sûr, je vous fais confiance.
Pourquoi ne le ferais-je pas ?
Dites-moi, quelle est
l'attitude de l'Empereur
face à la hausse
des hérétiques luthériens ?
Son Altesse fait tout ce qu'il peut
pour les supprimer.
Mon Roi rédige un pamphlet,
démolissant les arguments de Luther.
Le Roi François a déjà découvert
notre rapprochement avec l'Empereur.
Il se sent trahi
et menace nos intérêts.
Qui le lui a dit ?
Ah, M. Pace !
je crois que vous n'êtes
pas juste mon espion,
mais également celui des Français.
Non, cela n'est pas vrai !
Je vous en supplie.
Vous savez que c'est faux.
Écoutez-moi, je n'ai rien fait,
je suis innocent.
C'était Wolsey, Wolsey, Wolsey.
<i>Vous pensiez connaître l'Histoire.</i>
<i>Mais vous ne connaissez que la fin.</i>

Sa Majesté, le Roi !
Ma chère sœur.
J'espère que vous apprécierez
votre voyage.
Rappelez-vous,
le Roi du Portugal,
votre futur époux...
... vous aime et vous respecte.
Vous devez l'aimer en retour.
Rappelez-vous votre promesse.
Après sa mort,
j'épouserais qui je veux.
Charles,
si tu m'aimes,
prends soin d'elle.
Je le ferais.
N'ayez aucun doute.
Je m'en occuperais comme si
c'était ma propre sœur.
Que Dieu vous protège tous !
Et rappelez-vous vos devoirs,
envers Milady et l'Angleterre.
Prions !
Sa Sainteté remercie Dieu d'avoir
permis l'ascension d'un tel prince
afin qu'il devienne
un chantre de l'église.
Il exprime son étonnement que vous ayez
trouvé le temps de rédiger ce pamphlet.
En outre, pour montrer
sa gratitude,
le pape a décidé de vous honorer
d'un nouveau titre.
Fidei Defensor.
Fidei Defensor.
Défenseur de la foi.
Mais Votre Majesté doit savoir que,
Martin Luther
a aussi répondu à vos écrits.
Qu'a-t-il dit ?
Eh bien, il vous accuse de...
Oui ?
Il vous accuse de délirer comme
une prostituée en furie.
Il dit que :" Si le roi d'Angleterre
se donne le droit de vomir des mensonges
il me donne alors le droit
de les lui faire avaler."
Il doit être brûlé !
<i>Donnez-moi un coup de main
avec ces cordes !</i>
Ceci est votre cabine.
J'espère qu'elle trouvera
l'approbation de votre Majesté.
Elle conviendra.
Le lit est étroit, mais adéquat.
En cas d'action,
tous ces panneaux seront enlevés.
Action ?
Si nous sommes attaqués.
Qui nous attaquerait ?
Les pirates.
Il me semble, Votre Grâce,
que nous avons plus à craindre
des pirates déjà présents à bord.
Bonjour, Madame.
Votre Majesté.
Votre Majesté,

Votre Majesté.
<i>À la plus affectueuse

Monsieur Pace.
À votre service, Monsieur.
Vous êtes libre.
Je ne sais rien.
Comment ?
J'ai dit que vous étiez libre.
J'ai parlé à ma femme.
Je lui ai dit : je ne sais rien.
Rien du tout.
Vous avez
parlé à votre femme, M. Pace ?
Quand ?
Elle dort.
Nous avons parlé ensemble.
Je pensais qu'elle était morte
en donnant naissance à notre fils.
J'étais sûr, je...
Je suis allé aux obsèques
et j'ai pleuré.
Mais maintenant...
Je vois qu'elle est vivante,
autant que je le suis.
Ne la voyez-vous pas ?
Si, M. Pace. Je la vois.
Monsieur Cromwell !
Éminence.
J'ai longtemps remarqué votre...
aptitude pour le travail
et votre diligence
dans l'exécution de mes affaires,
ainsi que votre discrétion.
Je vous suis reconnaissant,
Votre Éminence.
Vous êtes un personnage obscur.
Mais je le suis autant.
Cela ne sera pas retenu
contre vous.
J'aurais peut-être
une proposition à vous faire.
Merci, Votre Éminence.
Selon les termes de
notre traité avec l'Empereur,
nous sommes obligés d'assumer,
financièrement, son effort de guerre.
À présent, ses armées se battent
contre les Français en Italie.
Près de Milan.
Malheureusement, j'ai calculé
que pour honorer nos obligations,
nous serons tenus
d'augmenter les taxes.
Un projet de loi sera présenté
au Parlement à la prochaine session.
Bien. Bien.
Je crois que le projet de loi
sera adopté avec succès.
Je suis sûr, Votre Éminence,
qu'entre vos mains, il en sera ainsi.
Au moins, notre alliance
avec l'Empereur est populaire.
Bien que je me demande parfois,
pourquoi il en est ainsi ?
Parce qu'il n'est pas français !
Exact.
Le nouveau vaisseau de guerre
est mis en service à Portsmouth.
J'ai omis de mentionner
à Votre Majesté....
Nous avons un nouveau
visiteur à la cour,
la Princesse Marguerite
de Navarre.
Je l'ai reçue hier, et je trouve
que c'est une très belle jeune femme,
avec un caractère
doux et avenant.
Elle voue une grande admiration
à Votre Majesté.
Dois-je arranger... ?
Oui. Oui, faites-le !
Avec votre permission, j'ai l'intention
de nommer un nouveau secrétaire,
en remplacement de M. Pace.
Oui !
<i>Nous allons nous amuser
à Lisbonne, les gars !</i>
<i>Les prostitués sont
les meilleures du monde.</i>
<i>Même si vous ne pouvez saisir
un mot de ce qu'elles disent.</i>
<i>Elles ne me parlent pas.</i>
<i>Elles ont toujours la bouche pleine !</i>
Nous y voilà, Votre Grâce.
Mon Roi prend votre Reine.
Eh bien, j'espérais plutôt que
le Valet prendrait la Reine.
Éminence.
Votre Majesté.
Puis-je vous présenter
la Princesse Marguerite de Navarre.
Madame.
Majesté.
Vous êtes en visite ici ?
Oui, Majesté.
Le Comte, mon époux,
a dû rester en France,
malheureusement.
En effet.
C'est très malheureux, Madame.
Mais vous aurez des compensations.
Vous profiterez de certains plaisirs
pendant votre séjour.
J'ai quelques nouvelles
qui pourraient intéresser Votre Grâce.
L'évêque de Winchester
est mort il y a 6 mois.
Winchester est la paroisse
la plus riche en Angleterre.
Wolsey est supposé
y nommer un successeur.
Et il vient de le faire.
Il s'est nommé lui-même.
Combien de richesses supplémentaires
cet homme veut-il ?
Et il y a plus.
Dites-moi !
Il apparaît
qu'il a utilisé l'argent du Roi
pour bâtir un nouveau collège à Oxford,
ainsi que sa propre fondation.
Il ferme les plus mauvais monastères,
les dépouille de leurs biens,
comme il est supposé le faire,
mais au lieu de transférer
tous les bénéfices au trésor secret,
il les fait disparaître.
Mon Dieu.
Vous devez le dire au Roi.
Tout de suite.
Pardonnez-moi Votre Grâce,
mais nous devons choisir
le moment avec exactitude.
L'emprise de Wolsey
sur le Roi est telle que,
quelle que soit la preuve qui l'accable,
le Roi ne le croira pas.
Mais viendra un jour,
où la foi du Roi en son ministre
sera mise en balance,
et à ce moment-là, Votre Grâce,
nous laisserons tomber
notre vérité dans la balance.
Et la balance tombera.
Mon cher Thomas !
Majesté.
Restez à la cour.
J'ai besoin de vous.
Je vous donnerai
de grands appartements.
Compton en a de grands.
Vous pourriez les avoir !
Autant que j'aime Votre Majesté,
j'aime que ma famille soit
à l'intérieur de mes appartements.
En effet.
Sa Majesté vous aime plus que nul autre,
M. More, et vous le savez.
Cela est peut-être vrai.
Et pourtant, si ma tête pouvait
lui faire gagner un château en Espagne,
je pense qu'il me l'aurait coupée.
M. Wyatt.
Votre Majesté.
J'ai appris que vous étiez un poète.
J'écris des poèmes,
je ne sais pas si je suis un poète.
J'en ai lu quelques-uns.
Je les ai appréciés.
Mon Seigneur,
je ne sais quoi dire.
Étiez-vous amoureux
d'Anne Boleyn ?
Je...
Le Cardinal Wolsey m'a dit que
par le passé, vous étiez fiancés.
Non, cela n'est pas vrai.
L'aimiez-vous ?
Lady Anne est tellement jolie que
c'est le devoir
de tout homme de l'aimer.
Je l'aimais, bien sûr,
mais de loin.
Personnellement, j'ai une épouse.
Appréciez la fête.
Thomas, Thomas Tallis.
Bonjour.
On voulait juste vous dire
que l'on adore votre musique.
Merci.
Nous partageons une chambre.
Voulez-vous nous y rejoindre ?
Je voudrais finir cette chanson.
Mais vous la finirez demain.
Demain, je l'aurais oubliée.
Et vous nous oublierez aussi.
Compton, mon ami.
Que penses-tu de la Princesse
Marguerite de Navarre ?
Elle est bien faite votre Majesté.
Un peu trop grosse vers le haut
à mon goût, Sir.
C'est la sœur de François.
Je suis au courant de ça.
<i>Oh, Majesté.</i>
<i>Ah, Majesté.</i>
C'est ça.
- Ah, mon Dieu, Henri.
- Mon Dieu,
Henri.
C'est fini.
Heureux de prendre votre argent
quand vous voulez, Votre Grâce !
Vous devriez garder votre argent
pour Lisbonne, Capitaine.
Bonne nuit.
Dégagez le passage.
Faites place.
Faites place.
Un messager de l'Empereur,
Votre Majesté.
Bien ! Qu'y a-t-il ?
L'Empereur a remporté
une grande victoire contre les Français.
Que dites-vous ?
À la bataille de Pavie, il ya 5 jours.
L'armée de l'Empereur
a totalement écrasé celle des Français.
L'armée française a été détruite.
Mon Dieu !
Est-ce vrai ?
Pas seulement cela !
Le Roi de France lui même a été capturé
sur le champ de bataille.
François ?
Le Roi François a été capturé ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Il est maintenant
le prisonnier de l'Empereur.
Vous êtes autant le bienvenu
que l'Archange Gabriel.
Nourrissez-vous !
Grandes nouvelles,
nous devons les fêter !
Venez !
<i>Atteint !</i>
<i>Un point pour M. Anthony Knivert !</i>
Bien joué, Tony !
Je te le dis, William,
je serais fait Chevalier ce jour,
ou ne le serais jamais.
<i>Sa Majesté, le Roi.</i>
<i>Sa Majesté...</i>
Ma Reine.
Milord.
- Hourrah pour sa Majesté !
- Milady.
<i>Bonne chance, Votre Majesté !</i>
Vous voyez comme la Reine
est populaire parmi les gens.
Elle est la fille d'Isabelle
et de Ferdinand.
Peut-être pensent-ils qu'elle est
telle qu'une Reine devrait-être.
<i>M. William Compton
relève le défi de Sa Majesté !</i>
Vous semblez un peu malade
aujourd'hui.
J'ai des raisons
d'être abattu et souffrant.
Mais il n'est pas nécessaire
de vous en préoccuper.
Pourquoi n'aurions-nous
pas de souffrances ?
Certaines personnes pensent que nous
irons au paradis sur des lits de plumes.
Mais ceci n'est pas
la bonne voie.
Le Seigneur lui-même y est allé
dans la douleur et les tourments.
Je ne suggère pas que cela
soit votre cas. Bien sûr.
Êtes-vous prêt ?
Je suis né prêt, William.
<i>Atteint ! Un point pour
Sa Majesté le Roi !</i>
Ne me regardez pas.
Je vous demande, secrètement,
de faire quelque chose pour moi.
Faites parvenir cette lettre
à l'Empereur.
Faites-le pour moi,
et ne la montrez
ou n'en parlez à personne.
<i>À nouveau !</i>
<i>Atteint ! Deux points
pour Sa Majesté.</i>
"J'ai été affligé que vous n'acceptiez
pas les broches.
Elles ont été faites pour vous
et pour nulle autre.
Et pourquoi n'en seriez-vous pas digne,
quand je vous estime ainsi ?
Il est sûr que cela vous paraît
clair maintenant,
que je désire trouver
place dans votre cœur."
Attendez ! Donnez-la moi !
Donnez-la.
"que je désire trouver
place dans votre cœur,
et que vous me témoigniez
une profonde affection."
Profonde affection ?
Profonde.
"Dites-moi au moins que l'on pourrait
se voir en secret.
Je n'entends rien de plus
qu'une chance de vous parler.
Je vous en prie,
revenez vite à la cour."
rendez-la moi, frère.
"Et en attendant, acceptez ce nouveau
présent et portez-le pour moi."
Quel présent ? Et où est-il ?
Oh, doux Jésus !
Amenez-le ici, valets.
Quand ramènerez-vous
ma nièce à la cour ?
Bientôt, je pense.
Maintenant l'appétit
du Roi est aiguisé.
Qu'est-ce cela ?
Juste une farce, Votre Majesté.
Juste une farce.
<i>Sa majesté le Roi
et M. Anthony Knivert !</i>
- Lance.
- À plaisance !
Prêt ?
Lance.
Le Roi a oublié sa visière.
Arrêtez ! Arrêtez !
Arrêtez !
Majesté ! Votre Majesté !
Laissez-moi voir.
- Ce n'est pas votre œil, Dieu merci.
- Un tissu pour moi !
Vous voyez ! Vous voyez !
Majesté !
Pouvez-vous me pardonner ?
Le pouvez-vous ?
Ce n'est pas votre faute Anthony !
Tout est ma faute !
C'est ma faute !
Vous ne m'avez pas blessé.
- Vous ne pouvez pas me blesser.
- Non !
Essayons encore !
Henri. Henri.
Madame, n'ayez crainte.
J'entends me remettre en selle
et prouver à tout ces présents
que je suis sain et sauf.
Si vous insistez, mais j'aurais préféré
que vous n'en fassiez rien.
Milady.
Armez-vous!
Oui.
Êtes-vous prêt pour moi, Anthony ?
Peuple d'Angleterre,
votre Roi est sauf !
Lance !
Est-ce qu'il respire ?
Amenez un médecin !
Knivert !
Anthony ! Anthony !
Vous vouliez me voir, votre Altesse ?
Je voulais seulement savoir combien
de temps resterons-nous en mer ?
Avec des vents favorables,
deux jours de plus.
Jouez-vous aux cartes, Votre Grâce ?
Parfois... Votre Altesse.
À quel jeu allons-nous jouer ?
À vous de choisir.
La couronne française.
Choisissez vos atouts.
Rois.
Très à propos,
Votre Altesse.
Du vin ?
Si vous voulez.
Votre Altesse doit attendre
son mariage avec impatience ?
J'ai ouï dire que le Roi était
un merveilleux cavalier...
... à son époque.
Et réputé pour
ses belles maîtresses.
Ne vous moquez pas de moi.
Je n'aime pas cela.
L'aimerez-vous lorsqu'un vieil homme
tentera de vous faire l'amour ?
Votre Grâce
va déjà trop loin.
L'Évangile
dit que la vérité vous libère.
Maintenant vous blasphémez !
Mes pauvres servantes,
ne devraient pas vous écouter.
Milady.
- Milady.
- Milady.
Je veux que vous partiez.
Vraiment ?
Oui, maintenant.
Pitié.
J'ai une bonne main.
Envoyez un message à l'Empereur.
Dites-lui notre joie et satisfaction
pour sa grande victoire à Pavie,
et pour sa capture du Roi de France.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Demandez-lui ce qu'il
compte faire de François.
Et si oui ou non,
François étant captif,
cela ne serait-il pas un bon moment
pour penser à attaquer la France ?
Dites-lui que nous avons de l'or,
des hommes et des navires
à sa disposition,
désirant partir en guerre
et partager un peu de sa gloire.
Oui, je le ferais.
Ah! Votre Majesté.
Voilà votre nouveau secrétaire.
Thomas Cromwell, c'est un avocat réputé,
un homme diligent et un savant.
Je pense qu'il sera très utile
à Votre Majesté.
M. Cromwell.
Mesdames.
Vous êtes de retour à la cour.
Puis-je vous voir en privé ?
Chérie.
Le Roi ! Le Roi !
Comment ça va ?
Très bien, ma petite. Et toi ?
Comme ci... comme ça !
Milady.
Pourquoi Wolsey ouvre-t-il
mon courrier ?
Ne suis-je pas la reine d'Angleterre ?
- Êtes-vous sûre qu'il l'a fait ?
- J'en suis sûre.
Je dois donc lui
dire de cesser.
Le Cardinal Wolsey
est parfois trop zélé.
Mais c'est toujours
dans notre intérêt.
À moins que vous ayez des secrets !
M. Anthony Knivert.
- Anthony.
- Majesté.
Tu as failli perdre un œil.
Je ne l'utilisais pas beaucoup
de toute façon.
À genoux.
Je t'adoube
Sir Anthony Knivert.
Levez-vous Sir Anthony
et soyez reconnu.
M. William Compton.
Pourquoi ce regard réprobateur,
Sir Anthony ?
Votre Majesté, j'ai failli perdre un œil
pour la même nomination.
Ah ! Mais tu n'as jamais
porté de tronc.
William !
À genoux.
C'est pour cela qu'il doit être
entendu que le Pape,
loin d'être un descendant de St. Pierre,
est un pécheur, un hypocrite,
un serviteur du diable,
et le vivant antéchrist sur terre !
Ceci est l'enseignement de Luther,
afin de nous libérer des fausses
adorations et des fausses idoles.
De sorte que l'on revienne
à la vraie religion,
et prenions le chemin authentique
et fructueux du salut !
Notre message d'espoir,
de liberté, de vérité,
s'étend déjà partout dans l'Europe,
d'un coin à l'autre.
Ici en Angleterre,
nous avons planté une graine,
qui, avec des prières, de l'action,
et parfois même, avec des sacrifices,
poussera pour devenir
un jour un grand arbre.
Dont les branches
atteindront tout le royaume,
et détruiront les maisons de la
monarchie putride de l'Antéchrist !
Et cet arbre...
Cet arbre sera appelé
l'arbre de la liberté.
Et sur ses branches
tout les anges de Dieu chanteront...
- Alléluia.
- Alléluia.
Alléluia.
J'ai longtemps rêvé de ce moment.
Anne,
vous devez savoir que
je vous désire de tout mon cœur.
Le jeune homme avec qui
vous jouiez, tout à l'heure,
qui était-il ?
Mon frère George.
Sa Majesté la Reine m'attend.
À plus tard.
Qui était-ce, Votre Majesté ?
Juste une fille.
Votre nouveau royaume.
- Le Roi doit vous attendre avec imp...
- Arrêtez ! Je vous l'interdis.
Je devrais vous haïr.
Mais vous n'en ferez rien.
Je sais que vous n'en ferez rien.
Que vais-je faire ?
<i>Le Palais Royal
- Lisbonne -</i>
Sauvez-moi.
Margaret...
Vous êtes encore plus belle
que sur votre portrait.
Je me sens très chanceux,
que vous soyez bientôt ma Reine.
Tout est à votre disposition.
Je veux seulement
que vous soyez heureuse.
Et que vous me rendiez heureux.
Et alors nous pourrons
avoir des enfants,
beaucoup d'enfants...
Avec l'aide de Dieu !
Que faites-vous ?
Ce que le Roi a ordonné !
<i>Peut-être n'avez-vous pas compris.</i>
<i>Mais je ne peux m'endormir,</i>
<i>je peux à peine respirer,
en pensant à vous.</i>
<i>Votre image est devant mes yeux
à chaque seconde.</i>
<i>Je crois presque que je pourrais
sacrifier mon royaume</i>
<i>pour une heure dans vos bras...</i>
<i>Je vous en prie,</i>
<i>choisissez le lieu et le moment
où l'on pourrait se rencontrer,</i>
<i>où je pourrais vous montrer
sincèrement mon affection,</i>
<i>laquelle est loin d'être ordinaire.</i>
<i>Rédigé de la main
de votre serviteur, Henri.</i>
Maintenant il est votre serviteur.
Avec un peu de soin subtil
et l'attrait de votre chair,
Il pourrait même devenir
quelque chose de plus proche.
Au nom du Père, et du Fils
et du Saint-Esprit.
Amen.
Est-ce que Sa Majesté...?
Arrêtez !
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Le sol est trop marécageux.
Nous devrons le contourner.
Qui le dit ?
Nous ne pouvons pas sauter
ce fossé, Votre Majesté.
Vous voulez dire que VOUS
ne pouvez pas le sauter.
La perche du drapeau !
Majesté ?
Oui, Sir Anthony ?
Que faites-vous ?
Je vais sauter par dessus
ce stupide fossé.
Rien ne s'interpose
entre moi et mon sport.
Êtes-vous sûr ?
Regardez ce que
le Roi d'Angleterre peut faire.
Oh !
Votre Majesté !
Allez chercher un médecin !
Vite !
Avec la permission de Votre Majesté,
puis-je danser avec votre épouse ?
Quand partez-vous ?
Demain.
Vous ne pouvez.
Pourquoi ne le pourrais-je ?
J'ai accompli mon devoir.
Pourquoi devrais-je rester ?
Vous avez une vie à mener.
C'est étrange.
Certains hommes qui semblent
au sommet de leur santé,
qui sont encore jeunes
et pleins de vie,
brusquement, s'écroulent et meurent.
D'autre part, certains hommes âgés,
dont les corps semblent usés,
dont la course semble finie,
peuvent continuer à vivre
pendant des années.
Ne trouvez-vous pas cela étrange ?
Me taquinez-vous parce que
cela vous amuse ?
Pour quelle autre raison ?
Parce que vous m'aimez.
Votre Majesté.
Votre Majesté.
Nous voudrions vous faire
une petite saignée.
Afin d'éliminer la bile
qui cause à Votre Majesté
tant de douleur.
Avec votre permission.
Oui.
J'ai failli mourir.
Non, pas de "Oui, Votre Majesté".
J'ai failli mourir !
Comprenez-vous ?
Depuis ce moment,
je n'ai fait que penser.
Et si j'étais mort ?
Qu'aurais-je laissé derrière moi ?
Je n'ai aucun héritier,
juste une fille et un bâtard.
Vous comprenez, Wolsey ?
La dynastie des Tudors...
ne serait plus !
Tout le travail de mon père, fini !
Et c'est de ma faute.
J'ai trop longtemps
vécu pour le plaisir.
Je n'ai même pas pensé au futur !
J'ai épousé la femme de mon frère
et Dieu m'a puni !
J'ai été si bête.
Désormais, tout va changer.
Tout.
Je veux un divorce.
Et vous tâcherez de l'obtenir.

Le Roi a oublié sa visière.
J'ai failli mourir.
Comprenez-vous ?
Je n'ai aucun héritier.
Juste une fille et un bâtard.
Tout le travail de mon père, fini !
Et c'est de ma faute.
Il y aura un sommet entre
le Roi François et le Roi Henri.
Il n'est plus seulement
Charles V, Roi d'Espagne,
mais c'est aussi
le Saint Empereur Romain.
Assurez-vous de traiter avec lui
et non pas avec les Français.
À nous deux, comment les Français,
pourraient-ils nous résister ?
Est-ce que l'Empereur est vraiment
sincère, quant à ce traité ?
Bien sûr qu'il l'est.
L'Empereur a remporté
une grande victoire contre les Français.
Le Roi de France lui-même a été capturé
sur le champ de bataille.
Il est maintenant
le prisonnier de l'Empereur.
le Roi du Portugal,
votre futur époux...
... vous aime et vous respecte.
Vous devez l'aimer en retour.
Rappelez-vous votre promesse.
Après sa mort, j'épouserais qui je veux.
Prends soin d'elle.
Je le ferais.
Je n'en doute pas.
Certains hommes au sommet de leur santé,
brusquement, s'écroulent et meurent.
Certains hommes âgés,

Me taquinez-vous parce que

Pour quelle autre raison ?
Parce que vous m'aimez.
Comment se déroulent nos affaires ?
Le Roi ne montre pas
clairement d'intérêt,
mais il est possible de le détecter,
par la manière qu'il a de la regarder.
Vous devez savoir que
je vous désire de tout mon cœur.
Maintenant, tout a changé.
J'ai épousé la femme de mon frère
et Dieu m'a puni.
Je veux un divorce.
Et vous tâcherez de me l'obtenir.

Sir Thomas Boleyn,
vous êtes, sur ordre et permission
de Sa Majesté le Roi Henri,
fais ce jour, Lord Rochford.
Levez-vous, Milord.
Majesté.
Henri Fitzroy.
Henri Fitzroy, vous êtes,
sur ordre et permission
de sa majesté le Roi Henri,
fais ce jour, Duc de Richmond
et de Somerset,
et Comte de Nottingham.
Levez-vous, Votre Grâce.
Son Éminence, le Cardinal Wolsey.
Votre Majesté.
J'ai vu que le bâtard de Sa Majesté,
a été fait Duc.
Ceci signifie-t-il qu'il va succéder
à Sa Majesté ?
Le prochain de la lignée au trône ?
Avant ma fille.
Oui, techniquement.
Il est mis avant tout les autres,
à l'exception d'un enfant légitime.
Sa Majesté aime notre fille,
il l'a montré à de moult occasions.
Je ne peux croire qu'il veut placer
son bâtard de fils, avant elle.
Je ne crois pas,
que Sa Majesté,
soit personnellement
responsable de cet acte.
Après tout, notre fille
est promise à l'Empereur.
Alors Votre Majesté n'a pas su.
L'Empereur a épousé
la Princesse Isabelle du Portugal.
Apparemment, il a jugé inutile
d'attendre que votre fille grandisse.
Et qui sait, peut-être
était-il influencé par le fait que
la belle Isabelle ait apporté avec elle
une dot d'un million de livres.
Il a rompu sa parole.
<i>Mon Seigneur.</i>
<i>Que vos gages et vos signes
d'affection m'effraient. </i>
<i>Comment puis-je être à vous
de la manière que vous pensez ?</i>
<i>Vous savez, je ne suis
qu'une roturière,</i>
<i>et je me crois indigne
de votre amour.</i>
<i>Cette offre que vous me faites et la
passion de vos mots et de vos regards,</i>
<i>ont ému mon cœur et mon âme.</i>
"Vous m'avez flatté avec d'innombrables
et d'inestimables présents."
"Permettez-moi à mon tour,
de vous offrir ce gage,"
" aussi petit soit-il."
"Et permettez-moi de rester,
dans tous les cas,"
"votre servante qui vous aimera
éternellement."
"Anne."
Votre Grâce.
Maman...
Maintenant, Henri, écoutez-moi.
Vous allez rejoindre votre
propre demeure maintenant.
Vous avez beaucoup de domestiques
pour vous aider
et s'occuper de vous.
Mais vous devez me promettre
d'être un bon garçon.
Attentionné et bienveillant
envers votre entourage.
Vous leur êtes peut-être supérieur,
mais si je vois que vous êtes
devenu trop hautain,
je serais triste et mécontente.
Oui, Maman,
je vous le promets.
Et je vous promets de venir vous voir
aussi souvent que je peux.
Et je suis persuadé que votre
nouvelle maison sera très grande.
Oh, je t'aime, mon fils adoré.
Je t'aime.
Pensez-vous qu'ils aient été
soupçonneux ?
Bien sûr qu'ils étaient soupçonneux !
N'avez-vous pas vu la manière dont
ses domestiques vous ont regardée ?
Mais son fils était ravi.
Je veux dire,
Sa Majesté était ravie.
Après tout, il a attendu la couronne
de nombreuses années.
Le vieil homme y était, sinistrement,
accroché.
Vous n'avez pas besoin
de m'en parler.
Qu'allons-nous faire ?
N'est-ce pas suffisant ?
Non. Bien, oui et non.
Nous finirons bien par
arriver en Angleterre.
Épousez-moi.
Comment ?
Vous m'avez entendu.
Épousez-moi.
Ma pauvre sœur.
En effet.
Être Reine pour quelques jours.
Cela semble incroyable.
Une tragédie.
À son retour, elle devra être traitée
avec aisance et gentillesse
pendant son deuil.
Quant à la question de l'annulation
du mariage de Votre Majesté.
J'ai établi une cour ecclésiastique
avec l'Archevêque Warham
pour réfléchir
et décider sur la question.
Elle se réunira en secret,
si Votre Majesté est d'accord.
Assurez-vous qu'ils prennent
la bonne décision.
Rapidement.
J'ai quelques autres nouvelles.
Au sujet de l'Empereur.
Il a libéré le Roi François.
Comment ?
Je le sais de source sûre.
À quelles conditions ?
J'ai encore à le découvrir.
Pourquoi n'ai-je pas été consulté ?
Nous sommes supposés être alliés !
À quoi joue-t-il ?
Dites à son ambassadeur
que je veux le voir.
Anne ! Anne !
Anne.
Je veux vous dire quelque chose.
Si cela vous convient d'être une
véritable amie et une maîtresse loyale,
de vous livrer à moi corps et âme,
je promets de vous garder
comme mon unique maîtresse.
Je n'aurais plus une once
d'affection pour nulle autre.
Si vous acceptez d'être
"ma maîtresse en titre"
je promets de ne servir que vous.
Maîtresse en titre ?
Votre maîtresse officielle ?
Oui !
Et vous aurez tout
ce que vous désirez.
Tout ce qu'il est en mon pouvoir
de vous procurer
est à vous, il suffit de demander.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Qu'ai-je donc fait pour que
vous me traitiez de la sorte ?
Qu'avez-vous fait ?
Quelle faute ai-je commise ?
Dites-moi ! Dites-moi !
Votre Majesté, j'ai déjà mis ma
virginité entre les mains de mon époux.
Et quel qu’il soit,
nul autre que lui ne l'aura.
Anne...
Parce que je sais comment
cela va finir.
Ma sœur est appelée
"la grande catin" par tout le monde.
Je suis désolé
de vous avoir offensée.
Je ne le voulais pas.
J'ai simplement exprimé
mes vrais sentiments.
Votre Majesté.
- Majesté.
- Ouvrez la porte !
- Majesté.
- Quoi ?!
Marie. Marie.
Rejoignez votre chambre.
Je viendrais plus tard.
Une autre visite, Votre Éminence !
Vous êtes tellement occupé.
Majesté, j'ai des bonnes nouvelles.
Depuis que Sa Majesté
a donné à son fils,
le Duc de Richmond,
sa propre demeure,
il considère que c'est le droit
de sa chère princesse Marie
d'avoir aussi la sienne.
Que voulez-vous dire ?
Sa Majesté a l'intention
d'envoyer la Princesse
au château de Ludlow dans
les contrées galloises.
Elle sera sous les soins
de Lady Salisbury,
sa gouvernante.
Son tuteur, le Dr Fetherston
l'accompagnera aussi,
ainsi que 300 membres du personnel
de maison de la Princesse.
Elle me sera prise ?
Non. Sa Majesté lui accorde
les vrais honneurs d'une Princesse.
C'est votre idée.
Madame, je suis souvent accusé de choses
qui ne sont ni de ma faute
ni de ma responsabilité.
Certaines personnes ont tendance
à dire du mal, sans connaître la vérité.
Je crains qu'elles aient empoisonné
l'esprit de Votre Majesté à mon égard.
Vous me prenez mon enfant.
Mon enfant !
Vous l'arrachez de moi, comme si
vous l'arrachiez de mon ventre.
J'obéis aux directives
de Sa Majesté.
Non.
Vous êtes mon ennemi.
Votre Majesté est injuste.
Sortez de ma vue.
Marie.
Marie !
L'ambassadeur de son Altesse
le Saint Empereur Romain.
Señor Mendoza,
je ne suis pas content
de vous voir.
Majesté ?
Votre maître a violé
toutes ses promesses.
Il a pris notre argent
mais l'a utilisé contre nous.
Il a négocié une paix séparée
avec le Roi de France
et sa Sainteté le Pape,
en négligeant son ami et allié.
Il n'a pas été de bonne foi.
Charles n'a que des mots pour moi,
les actes, il les garde pour d'autres.
L'Empereur ne trahira jamais
votre Majesté.
Jamais !
Il vous considère comme son oncle
Son putain d'oncle !
Quel âge ai-je ?
Eh bien, Votre Altesse doit
considérer que vous-même,
vous n'avez pas toujours
tenu vos obligations.
Après tout, nous n'avons reçu que la
moitié de l'or que l'on nous a promis.
Vos accusations sont
complètement fausses !
Inacceptables.
Je répondrai de ma conduite honorable
devant n'importe qui me contredisant.
Partez.
Milord Rochford.
Oui, votre Honneur.
L'Empereur vous envoie ses chaleureuses
félicitations pour votre ascension.
En quoi mon ascension
intéresse-t-elle l'Empereur ?
Il se soucie d'avoir des amis
à la cour d'Angleterre,
et il paye pour ce privilège.
A-t-il déjà beaucoup d'amis ici ?
Plusieurs.
Vous les connaissez.
Et que rapporte cette amitié ?
1000 couronnes... par an.
J'examinerai certainement
l'offre gracieuse de son Altesse.
Votre Grâce.
Milord !
Alors, comment avez-vous trouvé
l'ambassadeur impérial ?
Stimulant.
En effet.
Je pense que c'est un homme
avec beaucoup de principes.
En effet.
Alléluia.
Alléluia, en effet.
Milord.
Non, je ne faisais qu'écouter.
Oui. Je...
Vous avez un tel talent.
Je pense qu'Orpheus
lui-même en serait jaloux.
Sir.
<i>Bonne journée, Sir William.</i>
<i>Une très bonne journée.</i>
<i>Divine musique, n'est-ce pas ?</i>
Oui, je suis tout à fait d'accord.
Mesdames.
Sir William.
Non, Georges. S'il vous plaît.
Rendez-la-moi !
Je vous ai donné mon cœur,
maintenant je désire...
- Vous dédier mon corps
- Arrêtez ! S'il vous plaît.
Écrit par la main de celui qui,
dans le cœur, le corps et la volonté
est votre loyal et le plus sûr
de vos serviteurs,
H.R. Oh...
Et regardez ! Il a dessiné un petit cœur
entre les lettres H et R.
Imaginez,
le Roi d'Angleterre écrivant
à ma petite sœur,
lui promettant d'être son serviteur.
C'est incroyable.
Donnez-moi cette lettre.
Il est amoureux de vous.
Donnez-moi cette lettre !
Vous n'êtes pas amoureuse
de lui, n'est-ce pas ?
Il veut un divorce ?
Ce n'est pas un divorce.
Le Roi veut une annulation
basée sur le fait
qu'il n'a jamais été marié
en premier lieu.
En épousant la femme de son frère,
il a offensé les lois
de Dieu et des hommes.
Il désire simplement
que cela soit reconnu.
Le Pape lui a donné une dispense
pour épouser Catherine.
En effet, il l'a fait.
Personne ne le nie.
Mais le Roi se sent plus redevable
à Dieu qu'au Pape.
Sa conscience est véritablement
affligée et tendue.
Il a désobéi à l'injonction de Dieu.
Et rien de ce que Sa Sainteté
peut dire ou faire
ne pourra changer ce fait.
Le Pape est le représentant
de Dieu sur terre.
- Il parle en son nom.
- Voyons Thomas ! Que prétendez-vous ?
Les rois ont souvent divorcé.
Et les papes trouvent
toujours une excuse.
Je sais que vous êtes un idéaliste
mais vous n'êtes pas stupide.
Si Henri veut une annulation,
qui pourrait l'arrêter ?
Très bien. Vous parlez de faits.
Laissez-moi vous apporter des faits.
Catherine d'Aragon n'est pas juste une
grande Reine et la fille de grands Rois,
elle est aussi immensément populaire
partout dans tout le pays.
Dieu nous en garde que le Roi
doive l'abandonner
juste pour apaiser sa conscience.
Je ne crois pas que le peuple anglais
ne lui pardonnerait jamais.
Le sait-elle déjà ?
Le sait-elle déjà ?
<i>Église de Lambeth</i>

Bonnes gens de Lambeth.
En ce Vendredi saint
Sa Majesté la Reine,
distribuera l'aumône,
à vous, infortunés,
mais sincères et loyaux
sujets de leurs Majestés...
dans l'esprit chrétien
de charité et d'amour.
Votre Majesté....
Soyez bénis.
Et vous.
Que Dieu soit avec vous.
Et vous.
De bonne foi.
Votre Majesté,
je vous en prie, aidez-moi.
Que Dieu vous bénisse.
N'ayez crainte.
Vous êtes l'enfant de Dieu.
Soyez bénis.
Vous voulez voir
notre commerce ?
Désolé, beauté.
Mon cher William.
Charles, bon retour parmi nous.
Ça me fait plaisir de te voir.
Moi aussi. Viens, assied toi,
prend un verre.
Je ne comprends pas.
Pourquoi ici ?
Nous avons attendu
ton retour à la cour.
Comment va le Roi ?
Il attend anxieusement sa sœur.
Pour partager son chagrin.
Nous sommes mariés.
Quoi ?
Elle... et moi...
Nous sommes mariés.
Toi et...?
Oui.
Et voilà, Sir.
Tu dois lui dire.
Tu dois le dire au Roi.
Je dois lui dire ?
Pourquoi devrais-je lui dire ?
Car il vaut mieux
que cela vienne de toi.
Que se passe-t-il Charles ?
As-tu perdu ton courage ?
Il n'y a rien de drôle.
Alors pourquoi l'as-tu fait ?
Tu me connais.
Je ne réfléchis pas toujours.
Si tu le fais.
Mais pas avec ta tête.
Henri ?
Catherine,
j'ai quelque chose à vous dire.
En ce qui me concerne,
notre mariage est à sa fin.
En réalité il n'y a nul besoin
de mettre un terme
à quelque chose
qui n'a jamais existé.
Vous et moi n'avons jamais
été réellement mariés.
Il y a eu une mauvaise compréhension
des Écritures saintes
et un mauvais usage papal
de la loi canonique.
Il est vrai, je...
Je ne savais rien
de tout ça auparavant, mais...
Mais cela a été révélé
par des érudits.
Et cela accable ma conscience.
Cela m'oblige à mettre fin à votre gîte
et couvert une fois pour toutes.
Tout ce qu'il vous reste à faire,
c'est choisir où vous allez vivre,
et vous y retirer
aussi vite que possible.
Je vous jure,
tout sera fait pour le mieux.
Votre Grâce, Milords...
Je crois que vous savez pourquoi
nous sommes réunis ici, en privé.
Nous sommes ici
sur ordre de sa Majesté.
Sa Majesté a exigé une enquête
sur la nature de son mariage
avec Catherine d'Aragon,
pour la tranquillité de sa conscience
et la santé de son âme.
Comme il est dit dans le Lévitique :
"Si un homme doit prendre
la femme de son frère,
c'est une impureté.
Il a couvert la nudité de son frère.
Ils seront sans enfants."
Maintenant, Milords, si nous sommes
capables d'être d'accord entre nous,
que ce mariage n'a, en fait,
jamais été légal,
et a été instauré en désaccord
avec les lois ecclésiastiques
et canoniques,
tel que sa Majesté, à son grand regret,
est amené à le croire,
alors il est compréhensible
qu'en tant que représentant du Pape
j'ai, moi-même le pouvoir et l'autorité
de le dissoudre et d'y mettre fin.
Mais bien sûr je serais reconnaissant
d'entendre les avis de vos Seigneuries
sur cette grande question.
Votre Grâce ?
Je suis enclin a être en accord
avec Votre Éminence,
quoique, je réserve mon jugement
jusqu'à ce que j'ai entendu
toutes les opinions.
Milord Fisher.
Je ne vois aucun mérite
dans le cas du Roi,
ainsi exprimé.
Aucun, quel qu’il soit.
S'il y avait un obstacle
pour le mariage du Roi,
alors il a été surmonté
par la dispense du pape.
Le mariage était donc légal.
Et comme Votre Éminence le sait,
divorcer est interdit par l'Église.
C'est mon avis.
Madame.
Lady Salisbury est ici.
Votre Majesté.
J'ai amené votre fille
pour dire au revoir.
- Mon bébé.
- Votre Majesté doit se rassurer.
La Princesse sera bien traitée,
ainsi qu'il sied à son rang.
Il vous sera envoyé
des rapports réguliers
sur sa santé et ses réalisations.
Et naturellement vous lui
rendrez visite au cours
des déplacements officiels
de Votre Majesté.
Vous devez vous assurer
qu'elle répète sa musique.
Elle a une grande facilité
pour la musique.
<i>Soyez forte ma fille,
rappelez-vous qui vous êtes.</i>
<i>La descendante d'Isabelle
et de Ferdinand de Castille.</i>
<i>L'unique fille du Roi d'Angleterre.</i>
<i>Soyez forte, et soyez juste,
et un jour...</i>
<i>Un jour vous serez Reine.</i>
Oui, maman.
Est-il désolé ?
S'est-il repenti ?
Dites-moi !
A-t-il imploré mon pardon ?
Votre Majesté connaît sa Grâce.
Vous voulez dire
qu'il ne l'a pas fait.
Faites entrer ma sœur.
Vous ne portez pas de noir.
Non, Votre Majesté.
Mais vous êtes en deuil.
Votre époux est mort.
J'ai dit que votre époux est mort.
Il est vivant !
Mon époux est vivant.
Je ne vous ai pas donné
la permission d'épouser Brandon.
Et je ne le ferais jamais !
Vous m'avez donné votre promesse !
J'étais libre de choisir.
Je n'ai fait aucune promesse.
Vous faites erreur.
Comment osez-vous me regarder ?
Je suis votre Seigneur et maître,
non pas votre frère.
Vous êtes tous les deux
bannis de la cour.
Vous renoncerez
à vos maisons de Londres.
Vous disparaîtrez de ma vue.
Comprenez-vous ?
Oui...
Votre Majesté.
Et Margaret ?
Quoi ?
Je dois encore décider s'il faut faire
de votre partenaire un sans tête.
Dites oui.
Dites oui.
Vous êtes marié.
Alors ?
Alors...
Pourquoi me refuser ?
Je ne vous aime pas.
Est-ce tout ?
Pour moi. Oui.
Vous êtes si beau, Tom.
Vous êtes un Lord.
Que suis-je ?
Un génie.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Un paquet, Votre Majesté.
De qui vient-il ?
De Lady Anne Boleyn.
Un bateau...
avec une femme à bord.
Que représente le bateau ?
Un bateau est synonyme
de protection,
comme l'arche qui protégeait Noé.
Le diamant ?
Qu'est-il dit dans
le Roman de la Rose ?
"Un cœur aussi dur qu'un diamant,
"ferme..."
"ne change jamais."
Elle est le diamant.
Et je suis le bateau.
Elle a dit oui !
Le Roi François tend à un
rapprochement avec Votre Majesté.
Il est écœuré par la conduite perfide
de l'Empereur à votre égard,
conduite qu'il ne connaît
que trop bien,
ayant lui-même eu à en souffrir
en premier lieu.
Et vous offre, au lieu de cela,
une amitié vraie et durable.
Il est vrai,
l'Empereur nous a trahis.
Peut-être n'a-t-il jamais été sincère.
Cependant, il a toujours
des amis à la cour.
Quels amis ?
Mon agent a intercepté cette lettre.
La lettre est de la Reine.
Elle demande pourquoi l'Empereur
ne lui écrit pas plus souvent.
Et promet, comme à son habitude,
d'être sa loyale...
... et humble servante.
Sa servante.
Pas la mienne.
Dites à l'ambassadeur français
que nous sommes d'humeur à un
rapprochement avec le Roi François.
Dites-lui d'envoyer des émissaires.
Soyons des alliés contre cet Empereur.
Milady.
J'ai étendu ma prétention
à votre virginité.
Et moi, je vous fais
cette promesse :
quand nous serons mariés,
je vous donnerai un fils.
Non.
J'honorerai votre virginité,
jusqu'à ce que nous soyons mariés.
Je ne peux faire moins pour l'amour.
Oh mon amour.
Amour...
Je vous prouverais quotidiennement
que je peux être pour vous
à la fois aimante et gentille.
Je vous hais !
Vous avez dit que
ça se passerait bien !
Vous avez dit qu'il vous croirait !
vous l'avez dit, vous l'avez promis !
Pour l'amour de Dieu, femme !
Ne m'appelez pas femme.
Je ne veux pas être votre femme.
Je vous hais !
Non, ce n'est pas vrai !
Si, je vous hais.
Sans vous, je serais toujours
Reine du Portugal.
Et maintenant que suis-je ?
Vous êtes ivre
et vous êtes stupide !
Henri nous pardonnera.
Il fait juste le fier.
Nous avons blessé sa vanité.
Croyez-moi.
Pourquoi le devrais-je ?
Je ne sais pas si vous êtes
vraiment courageux
ou si vous êtes juste
un putain d'imbécile.
Moi non plus.
Mon Dieu...
Merci, Alice.
Je sais que vous avez parlé à Wolsey.
Et je sais que vous n'approuvez pas
ce que j'essaye de faire.
C'est à l'encontre
de votre conscience.
Et je ne vais pas tenter
de vous faire changer d'avis.
C'est peu probable que j'y arrive.
Mais je souhaite que
vous compreniez, Thomas.
J'ai besoin de vous expliquer.
J'ai vécu avec la femme de mon frère.
Et j'ai été amené à croire
que leur mariage a été consommé.
Si cela est vrai,
alors j'ai vécu dans le péché.
Pouvez-vous comprendre
ce que je ressens, Thomas ?
C'est pourquoi j'ai demandé au cardinal
d'examiner la question.
Mais s'il est prouvé que
la dispense papale était valable
et qu'il n'y a pas eu de péché ?
Je serais alors l'homme le plus heureux.
Je serais content de vivre avec
Catherine jusqu'à la fin de mes jours.
Attendez.
Je vous le demande à nouveau.
Si le Roi
est si troublé par sa conscience,
pourquoi a-t-il attendu si longtemps
pour ressortir cette affaire ?
À cause de son amour pour la Reine,
il a lui-même nié la vérité.
Mais son échec à avoir un fils vivant,
en est une preuve.
Donc, il veut se remarier ?
Si son mariage est annulé, alors oui,
je suis certain qu'il se remariera,
dans l'espoir d'avoir un héritier.
Il a un héritier.
Je ne crois pas un seul instant
que le peuple anglais acceptera
un bâtard comme légitime héritier,
et le Roi non plus.
Il a une fille légitime.
Milords,
l'histoire d'Angleterre
est jonchée par les tragédies
de ceux qui ont transmis
leur couronne à leurs filles.
Alors...
Il a une nouvelle épouse à l'esprit ?
Il envisage d'en prendre une, oui.
C'est dégoûtant !
Je pense que vous devriez
être prudent, Milord.
Comme vous devriez l'être aussi !
Un des grands avantages d'avoir
une bibliothèque, Votre Éminence,
est qu'elle est pleine de livres.
Et plusieurs de ces livres
renferment les lois ecclésiastiques.
Et selon ces livres,
vous n'avez aucune autorité
pour juger cette question.
Elle est dévolue au Pape seul.
Ou à ceux qu'il nomme.
Il semble que dans ce cas,
Votre Éminence,
votre aspiration a dépassé
votre atteinte.
J'ai donc invité une délégation
française à la cour de votre Majesté,
pour discuter d'un nouveau traité,
nous unissant face à l'intransigeance
et à l'agression de l'Empereur.
Bien. Excellent.
Et puisque l'Empereur est revenu sur
sa promesse d'épouser votre fille,
il serait peut-être avisé de ressusciter
ses fiançailles avec le Dauphin.
Ou si le Dauphin est déjà promis,
peut-être au Duc d'Orléans,
le plus jeune fils du Roi François.
Et qu'en est-il de
votre réunion secrète ?
Sont-ils arrivés à une décision ?
Dans combien de temps puis-je
m'attendre à mon annulation ?
Votre Majesté ne devrait
pas s'inquiéter, mais...
Nous étions incapables
de parvenir à une conclusion.
Incapables ?
Cette question est complexe.
Réellement ? Comment ?
Nous pensons que nous devrions
nous en remettre au Pape Clément
pour une décision sur cette question.
Puisqu'il apprécie Votre Majesté,
je suis certain qu'il statuera
en votre faveur.
Oh, je l'espère bien.
Je l'espère vraiment.
Pour votre intérêt.
- On peut toujours reconnaître
les Français. - Oh, oui. Les proxénètes.
Ils n'ont rien fait d'aussi intelligent
que d'octroyer à Wolsey une pension.
Il ne les a jamais laissés tomber.
Nous devons attendre et voir.
Quand la roue de la Fortune
aura atteint son zénith,
il ne lui restera plus
qu'une direction.
Écartez-vous !
Dégagez de mon chemin !
J'apporte
de très importantes nouvelles !
Votre Majesté,
Rome a été mise à sac.
Laissez-le entrer !
Votre Majesté, j'apporte
les plus épouvantables
et calamiteuses nouvelles.
Rome a été conquise et pillée
par les mercenaires germains
et espagnols de l'Empereur.
Ils ont pillé et souillé ses églises,
détruit ses reliques
et ses trésors sacrés,
torturé et tué
des milliers de ses prêtres.
Qu'en est-il de Sa Sainteté ?
Le Pape est prisonnier
au château de Sant’Angelo.
Il est le prisonnier de l'Empereur ?
Oui.
Lady Blunt.
Il a attrapé la suette miliaire.
Il n'y avait plus rien à faire
Il s'est plaint ce matin
d'être malade.
Le soir, il était
entre les mains de Dieu.

En ce qui me concerne,
notre mariage est à sa fin.
Il veut un divorce !
Les rois ont souvent divorcé
et les papes trouvent
toujours une excuse.
Si cela vous convient, je vous prendrais
comme mon unique maîtresse.
Qu'ai-je donc fait pour que
vous me traitiez de la sorte ?
J'honorerai votre virginité,
jusqu'à notre mariage.
Peut-être serait-il judicieux d'inclure
le Duc de Suffolk dans nos plans ?
Il serait un allié naturel.
Et je suis sûr qu'il hait Wolsey
autant que nous.
Pensez-vous qu'ils aient été
soupçonneux ?
Bien sûr qu'ils étaient soupçonneux !
Qu'allons-nous faire ?
Épousez-moi.
Je ne vous ai pas donné
la permission d'épouser Brandon.
Je suis votre Seigneur et maître,
non pas votre frère !
Vous êtes tous les deux
bannis de la cour.
Je vous jure,
mon honneur et ma loyauté.
Vous devrez toujours
me faire confiance.
Votre maître a violé
toutes ses promesses.
Il a négocié une paix séparée
avec le Roi de France
en négligeant son ami et allié.
Le Roi François, lui, vous offre
une amitié vraie et durable.
Soyons des alliés
contre cet... Empereur.
J'ai établi une cour
ecclésiastique pour décider
pour décider de l'annulation
du mariage de Votre Majesté.
Vous n'avez aucune autorité
pour juger cela.
Elle est dévolue au Pape seul.
Je suis certain qu'il statuera
en votre faveur.
Oh, je l'espère bien.
Pour votre intérêt.
Rome a été conquise par l'Empereur.
Le Pape est prisonnier.
Il est le prisonnier de l'Empereur.

"Mon cher amour,
je ne puis dire combien
vous me manquez.
Je me vois, particulièrement en soirée,
dans les bras de ma bien-aimée,
dont..."
Je vous en prie, continuez.
"Dont je crois brièvement
embrasser les jolis seins.
Ni la langue ni la plume ne peuvent
exprimer la douleur de ne pas vous voir.
La seule compensation est le frisson
de prévoir notre prochaine rencontre.
Quelle joie dans ce monde
peut être plus grande
que la compagnie de celle
que l'on chérit le plus ? "
Eh bien...
Le Roi est complètement
amoureux de vous.
Voyez-vous ma nièce,
cela rend un homme,
tout homme...
extrêmement vulnérable.
Appréciez-vous
votre mission, ma chérie ?
Je...
Au début, j'avoue que
je ne l'aimais pas tellement.
Je ne me souciais pas du Roi.
Mais à présent, je...
- À présent je...
- Il serait sage de ne pas être dupée
par votre propre mascarade.
Il est de votre devoir d'utiliser
cet amour à notre avantage
pour remplacer Wolsey.
Le Cardinal s'interpose entre nous
et nos réalisations.
Et vous avez maintenant le pouvoir
de lui faire beaucoup de mal.
Et nous nous attendons
à ce que vous le fassiez.
J'irais directement à Paris
pour rencontrer le Roi François
et ratifier le nouveau traité
entre Vos Majestés.
Et puisque Sa Sainteté reste
prisonnier de l'Empereur,
j'ai appelé à un conclave
des Cardinaux à Paris.
Il sera facile de les persuader,
en l'absence du Pape,
de m'accorder le droit et l'autorité
d'apporter un jugement final
sur l'annulation du mariage
de Votre Majesté.
Partez avec notre bénédiction.
Et dans l'attente de votre succès,
Votre Éminence,
pour lequel nous sommes
très impatient.
Je suis le fidèle et humble serviteur
de Votre Majesté.
Oh, j'oubliais.
Vous emmènerez
quelqu'un avec vous.
Son nom est Thomas Wyatt.
Le poète ?
Je ne l'aime pas.
Il a déjà possédé
un joyau que je désire.
Lady Anne, que faites-vous ici ?
J'ai audience avec Sa Majesté.
Qu'aurait donc une sotte
comme vous à dire au Roi ?
Votre Majesté.
Dites-moi qu'il va réussir.
Qui, ma chérie ?
Wolsey.
Il le fera, n'est-ce pas ?
Il aura une annulation ?
Bien sûr qu'il le fera.
N'en doutez point.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
N'est-ce pas étrange ?
Étrange ?
De confier une aussi grande affaire
à un seul serviteur,
quel qu'il soit.
Quand Votre Majesté
en a des milliers
prêts et disposés
à accomplir vos souhaits,
et quand votre grand bonheur
dépend de cette résolution.
Mon amour.
Ceci ne devrait pas vous inquiéter.
Pardonnez-moi.
Je ne devrais pas en parler.
Non, non.
Je vous autorise à toujours
me parler franchement,
honnêtement, ouvertement
et avec sincérité.
Pour moi ceci
est le vrai sens de l'amour.
Excusez-moi, Ambassadeur,
de vous recevoir ici.
Je suis à la disposition
de Votre Majesté.
Señor Mendoza. Aidez-moi.
Bien sur, je suis le serviteur
de Votre Majesté.
Je dois transmettre
un message à l'Empereur.
Je n'ai pas d'autres voies
pour le faire.
Wolsey ouvre toutes mes lettres.
Et à présent, je sais qu'il a transformé
en espionnes nombre de mes dames.
De quelles manières ?
Avec de l'argent ou parfois même,
en leur accordant
des faveurs sexuelles.
Grand Dieu. Comment
puis-je vous aider ?
L'Empereur est le chef
de ma famille.
Je veux qu'il sache
que le Roi essaye de divorcer.
Il veut le garder secret,
mais il a déjà entamé des procédures.
C'est impossible !
Il a sûrement besoin
de la permission du Pape ?
Mais le Pape est encore
le prisonnier de l'Empereur.
Señor Mendoza,
pour l'amour de notre
sauveur, Jésus Christ,
dites à mon neveu ce qui m'arrive.
Laissez-moi m'en occuper.
Je trouverais un moyen d'esquiver
les espionnes du Cardinal.
Je vous en remercie.
<i>- Compton Wynates -
Warwickshire</i>
À quoi pensez-vous ?
Je ne pensais pas.
J'écoutais.
Vous travaillez sur quelque
chose de nouveau ?
Pour travailler sur quelque chose,
je dois d'abord l'entendre.
Je vous aime.
Et qu'en est-il de votre femme ?
Vous savez très bien
qu'elle ne l'est pas.
Je n'ai jamais cru que l'amour
devait être lié par une doctrine.
Je dois partir.
Vous devez partir ?
Pourquoi ?
Cardinal Wolsey se rend en France.
Il m'a invité à l'accompagner.
Ainsi que d'autres musiciens.
Devez-vous partir ?
Vous savez parfaitement que l'invitation
d'un cardinal est comme celle d'un Roi.
Nous bas peuple, devons mettre nos mains
dans le feu si nous y sommes invités.
Vous me manquerez.
Non je ne crois pas.
Vous trouverez bientôt
d'autres distractions.
Parlez-moi sincèrement :
qu'espérez-vous de cette mission ?
J'ai de nombreux espoirs.
Premièrement, guérir les blessures dues
à des années de conflits anglo-français.
Et ensuite œuvrer à un nouvel
équilibre des forces en Europe.
Le pillage de Rome,
l'emprisonnement du Pape,
ces événements
ont déstabilisé toute l'Europe.
Et l'Église ?
L'Église a aussi besoin de médiation.
À ce conclave spécial nous établirons
un conseil général lequel,
en l'absence du Pape,
traitera les questions urgentes
d'hérésie et de réforme.
Et l'affaire du Roi ?
Cela sera aussi traité, mais comme
une affaire parmi d'autres.
Vous pensez que les cardinaux vous
donneront autorité pour traiter cela ?
Oui.
Et vous serez alors de facto, Pape.
Et puisque Sa Sainteté ne pourra
jamais s'échapper de sa captivité...
C'est une pure spéculation.
J'ai du travail à faire, Sir Thomas.
Pourquoi êtes-vous
assise dans le noir ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
Vous ne comprendriez pas.
Bien sûr que si !
Suis-je votre frère ou pas ?
Si seulement vous étiez
comme avant.
Je me souviens.
Je vous parlais de tout.
Tous mes secrets.
Vous pouvez encore m'en parler.
Je ne peux.
Pourquoi ?
Vous les partageriez.
<i>- Le Palais du Roi François de Valois -
Paris, France</i>
Votre Majesté.
On vous salue, Cardinal Pacificus.
Cardinal de la paix.
Éminence.
Aussi belle que jamais,
comme le soleil.
Vous êtes vraiment charmant,
Monsieur le Cardinal.
Et nous vous traiterons comme un frère,
car c'est ce que vous êtes.
Un fidèle et loyal ami de la France.
Nous vous souhaitons la bienvenue...
et tout ceux qui vous accompagnent,
à notre cour et dans nos cœurs.
Je suis extrêmement honoré,
Votre Majesté.
Et très ému.
- Tallis.
- Mr. Wyatt.
Je réfléchissais.
Peut-être pourriez-vous
mettre un de mes poèmes en musique.
J'en serais honoré.
En avez-vous déjà un de prêt?
Je travaille dessus.
J'ai écrit les premières lignes.
Alors vous avez presque tout !
Bonjour, Votre Grâce.
Le Duc d'Orléans est très heureux
d'être fiancé avec la princesse Marie.
Très, très heureux.
Vous n'aimez pas trop les Français,
n'est-ce pas?
Ils ne me dérangent pas, M. Wyatt.
C'est juste qu'ils sont
toujours tellement...
... Français.
Y avait-il des lettres pour moi ?
Aucune lettre, Madame.
Lady Anne !
Oui, Votre Majesté...
Je sais ce que vous faites.
Mais ne pensez pas
à éloigner le Roi de moi.
Laissez-le jouer avec vous.
Laissez-le...
vous faire des présents.
Mais il ne pourra
vous donner son cœur
car je l'ai en ma possession.
Des lettres de Son Éminence
Cardinal Wolsey.
Votre Majesté doit savoir
que Sa Sainteté le Pape Clément,
s'est évadé du Château de Sant’ Angelo.
Il s'est évadé ?
Apparemment il s'est déguisé
en vieil aveugle
et est sorti devant ses ravisseurs.
Où est-il à présent ?
Selon mes informations, dans
une ville italienne appelée Orvieto,
dans le palais de l'évêque,
avec ce qui reste de sa cour.
Bien sûr, il est toujours
sous l'emprise de l'Empereur.
Et pourtant il est libre.
Il serait possible...
Il serait possible
de lui envoyer quelqu'un.
Pour lui délivrer un message.
En effet, il serait possible.
De qui tenez-vous tout cela ?
De Wolsey ?
Non, Majesté.
J'ai mes propres sources.
Admettons que je voudrais
porter un message à Sa Sainteté.
Connaissez-vous quelqu'un ?
Quelqu'un à qui vous feriez
confiance avec votre vie ?
Dr. Knight. Un homme de Dieu.
Un diplomate et un vrai anglais.
Amenez-le moi.
<i>Reconnaissance de dettes
pour location de terre</i>
<i>due à l'Archevêque,
Thomas Wolsey d'York.</i>
C'est donc ainsi qu'il l'a fait !
Annoncez.
Mes deux Reines gagnent.
Je hais les cartes !
Je hais cette cour !
Je hais même le temps lui-même.
Votre Majesté, pourrais-je
faire une suggestion ?
N'importe quoi.
Oubliez la cour.
Allons dans les bois.
Allons à la chasse,
comme nous avions
l'habitude de faire.
Oui ! Oui !
Mais sans Brandon.
- Charles est votre...
- Je n'ai pas pardonné à Milord Suffolk.
Je ne peux lui pardonner.
Il n'a jamais demandé la permission
d'épouser ma sœur.
C'est... d'une arrogance
insupportable !
Je veux dire, à quoi s'attend-il ?
Écoute...
Je ne veux pas qu'il
soit banni pour toujours...
juste aussi longtemps
qu'il respire !
Allons-y.
Vous savez ce que nous devrions faire ?
- Non, mon amour ?
- Faire un pique-nique.
Chez les Compton.
Gardez vos yeux ouverts.
Bienvenue !
Vois-tu William...
Les choses peuvent parfois changer !
Sir Thomas Boleyn, Votre Grâce.
- Milord...
- Votre Grâce.
À quoi dois-je ce plaisir ?
Puis-je parler franchement ?
À votre santé, Milord.
À la vôtre.
Norfolk m'a envoyé.
Mais Norfolk me déteste.
Je suis un parvenu, après tout.
Et il est, de loin, trop grand pour moi.
Je soupçonne qu'il nous méprise
tous pour les mêmes raisons,
et pourtant il a des intérêts à protéger
et à approfondir, comme nous tous.
Il doit traiter avec nous
tel que nous sommes.
Et, après tout,
il y a quelqu'un
qu'il hait plus encore.
- Le Cardinal.
- Bien sûr.
Mais en quoi cela me concerne ?
La cour vous manque-t-elle,
Votre Grâce ?
Peut-être pas.
Ici, dans cette verte contrée,
vous avez tant de loisirs à apprécier.
Tant de vagues recherches.
Et pourtant, j'ai ouï dire par certains
que la présence du Roi
est comparable au soleil.
Et lorsque vous êtes loin de lui,
il n'y a qu'une nuit éternelle.
Vous êtes un homme intelligent, Boleyn.
C'est ce que les gens disent.
Ils disent que vous êtes
charmant et intelligent.
Que veut Norfolk ?
Il veut que vous nous aidiez
à détruire Wolsey,
et en échange, il persuadera le Roi
de vous pardonner,
et de vous accueillir
de nouveau à la cour.
Merci, Milord.
Qu'avez-vous entendu ?
Tout.
Qu'allez-vous faire ?
Que dois-je faire ?
Vous m'aviez dit que parfois
Wolsey avait été gentil avec vous.
L'ai-je dis ?
J'avais complètement oublié.
Il semble que Sa Majesté
soit amoureux.
Sir.
Pauvre Harry.
Tallis...?
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Vous, maudits poètes
ne dormez jamais ?
J'ai écrit les premières lignes.
Puis-je vous les lire ?
"Elles me fuient,
me laissant parfois chercher,
Pied nu, traquant dans ma chambre.
Je les ai vus gentils,
domptés et docile,
ceux-là sont à présent sauvages.
Et n'oublie pas que parfois
ils se mettent en danger
pour prendre du pain de ma main.
Et maintenant ils s'étendent,
recherchant activement avec
un changement continuel..."
- C'est tout ce que j'ai pour l'instant.
- C'est merveilleux.
Il y a de la musique dedans.
De quoi parle-t-il ?
- D'une fille
- Quelle fille ?
Appelons-la "La Brunette".
Je l'ai aimée jadis.
Et je pense qu'elle m'a aimé.
Mais maintenant
elle appartient à un autre ?
Garçons !
Silence !
Elle n'est peut-être qu'une fille,
mais je vous le dis M. Tallis,
si elle parvient à son but,
elle infligera la terreur
à tout le pays.
Merci.
Sa Majesté veut s'assurer que
votre Éminence a tout ce qu'il désire.
Excusez-moi. Si j'étais...
... plus jeune,
ou plus idiot, ou...
... plus vivant...
J'accepterais volontiers cette offre.
Vous méritez mieux que d'être
utilisée comme une catin.
Milords et Miladies, La Reine.
Votre Majesté.
Votre Majesté.
Votre Majesté.
Votre Majesté.
Votre Grâce.
Votre Grâce.
Majesté.
- Lord Darby.
- Ma Reine.
J'ai quelque chose pour vous.
Voyez-vous ?
Le faucon est votre crête...
Et la grenade est la sienne !
Vous ne comprenez toujours pas,
n'est-ce pas ?
Ce n'est pas un jeu, Georges.
C'est dangereux !
Maîtresse Boleyn.
- Mr. Cromwell.
- J'ai quelques nouvelles.
Le Roi expédie un homme bon pour voir
le Pape, avec des lettres du divorce.
Un certain Dr. Knight.
Je connais Dr. Knight.
Il était mon précepteur.
En effet.
Tout les faits se rejoignent.
Ladies.
Sir.
Aurais-je raison de penser que vous êtes
les suivantes de Sa Majesté ?
Oui, Sir.
Georges Boleyn.
Vous ne me connaissez pas
maintenant, mais un jour si.
Nous pourrions nous être utiles.
De quelle manière ?
Dites-moi avec qui vous couchez,
et je vous dirais
si c'est une bonne idée.
Vous comprenez ?
Et en retour ?
Je penserais à quelque chose.
Cela dépend de votre envie
d'être riches et connues.
C'est quelque chose
que je peux arranger.
Je suis un bâtisseur de fortunes.
Voici !
Nous comptons sur vous, Dr. Knight,
pour délivrer ces deux lettres
à Sa Sainteté, à Orvieto.
Elles sont rédigées
de nos propres mains.
Majesté.
Il serait préférable pour l'Europe
que nous faisions maintenant
la paix avec l'Empereur.
Comment pouvez-vous dire cela ?
Il m'a fait prisonnier.
Il m'a écrasé les bourses.
J'ai dû lui payer
des millions de rançon.
Et le plus âgé de mes fils
est toujours son prisonnier.
Comment puis-je faire la paix
avec ce tas de merde ?
Vous devez être satisfait par les
progrès que vous avez faits jusqu'ici.
Pour être honnête,
il ya comme un fardeau
traînant mon vieux corps cassé,
de pays en pays.
Vous préféreriez être à la maison.
Ce qui me tourmente plutôt
c'est que le Roi,
soit sous l'influence d'autres
pendant mon absence.
Après le conclave,
vous ne serez plus tourmenté.
Vous aurez bientôt
le pouvoir de lui plaire.
Bonsoir Milord.
Merci.
Garçon !
Garçon !
Soyez maudits !
Le Roi !
Chère Anne.
La Reine !
Non, non !
Attendez !
Juste un moment.
Ce soir je dîne avec
votre père et votre oncle.
Votre Majesté, mon père dit
que cela dépasse ses mérites.
Non, car quand je suis avec eux,
je suis proche de vous.
Voici.
Un autre gage de mon affection.
Prenez-le.
De votre humble serviteur.
Votre cou.
J'aime votre cou.
Milords, trinquons à la résolution
de l'affaire qui prime à nos yeux.
- Votre Majesté.
- Majesté.
Bientôt nous aurons une réponse.
Je la vois venir du Dr. Knight
beaucoup plus que du Cardinal Wolsey.
Pourquoi cela ?
Je crains qu'il ne soit pas dans
l'intérêt du Cardinal de réussir.
Mais il est sûr que son intérêt
et le mien sont les mêmes.
Il est mon serviteur.
Sa Grâce entend que le Cardinal
a des préjugés contre ma fille.
Je sais. Je sais.
Il l'a traitée de sotte.
Elle me l'a dit.
Il y a autre chose.
Milord ne voulait pas vous le dire, mais
il est certaines choses dont
Votre Majesté doit être informée.
Allez-y !
Majesté,
par votre grande bonté, j'ai été nommé
contrôleur des demeures de Votre Majesté
et de par mes fonctions, j'ai...
J'ai découvert que lorsque
des églises corrompues sont fermées,
au lieu que leurs fonds aillent
au trésor, comme ils devraient l'être,
ils sont souvent détournés ailleurs.
Ailleurs ?
Dans les fondations privées de Wolsey.
Dans la création de son
grand collège à Oxford.
Je dois l'admettre,
je trouve vos suggestions choquantes.
En effet, je suis blessé.
Le Cardinal Wolsey n'est pas
seulement mon Chancelier
il a toujours été un ami.
Dans ce monde, Majesté,
un fidèle et loyal ami
est le meilleur compagnon
qu'un homme puisse avoir.
Car pour tout le reste,
il y a une étrange habitude d'abandon.
Cela me rappelle que le Duc de Suffolk
est venu pour me voir.
Il dit qu'il ramperait à genoux pour
implorer le pardon de Votre Majesté.
Ce collier.
Qui vous l'a donné ?
Répondez-moi.
Sa Majesté.
Vous êtes une onéreuse
catin !
Je ne suis pas une catin...
Votre Majesté.
J'aime Sa Majesté.
Je crois qu'il m'aime.
Il est épris de vous, comme
les hommes le sont souvent
par les nouvelles choses.
Il s'apercevra rapidement
de ce que vous êtes vraiment.
Et il se lassera de vous...
Comme toutes les autres.
Et si ce n'était pas le cas ?
Je ne vous ai pas donné
la permission de parler !
Vous êtes une servante !
Partez maintenant !
Partez !
<i>Campagne près
de Rouen, France</i>
Au pas !
Au pas !
- En ligne !
- Qui êtes-vous ?
Dr. Knight ?
Excusez-nous, Sir.
Nous devons interrompre
votre voyage pour une journée ou deux.
Impossible !
Je suis sur ordre du Roi.
Oui, Sir, nous le savons.
C'est pour cela que vous devez
nous accompagner.
Ah, Dr. Knight.
Entrez.
- Votre Éminence, je...
- Je fais de mon affaire
de connaître les affaires du Roi.
Vous pensiez pouvoir
vous rendre à Orvieto
sans que je le sache ?
Donc, le Roi vous a envoyé au Pape
avec ces 2 lettres, est-ce correct ?
Oui.
Ce sont des documents extraordinaires.
Savez-vous ce qu'ils contiennent ?
Oui.
Un peu.
Et vous êtes toujours d'accord
pour les porter ?
Le premier document, demande au Pape
de lui permettre, une fois divorcé,
d'épouser toute femme de son choix...
même celle
qui lui serait normalement interdite
en raison de relations antérieures
avec un de ses parents !
Je ne comprends pas.
Le Roi a écrit cela.
De quelle femme veut-il parler ?
Maîtresse Anne Boleyn.
Anne Boleyn ?
Le Roi aime Anne Boleyn ?
Oui, Sir.
Et quelles sont ces relations
antérieures dont le Roi fait référence ?
Votre Éminence est sûrement
au courant que
Sa Majesté a eu des relations charnelles
avec Marie, la sœur aînée d'Anne.
Peut-être même avec leur mère.
Ainsi dit la rumeur.
Je ne lui donne aucune créance.
Par respect pour leur mère.
Et le second document.
L'avez-vous lu ?
Non, Sir.
C'est aussi bien.
Je ne voudrais être celui qui présentera
ceci au descendant de Saint Pierre.
Il demande ceci : si l'annulation
du mariage du Roi serait impossible
le Pape devrait alors l'autoriser
à prendre une seconde femme.
Comprenez-vous ? Il demande au Pape
d'autoriser la bigamie.
Puisque le Roi l'ordonne,
vous devriez être en route, Dr. Knight.
Mais sans aucun espoir
de succès... ou d'honneur.
J'ai entendu dire que vous
avez rampé ici comme un chien.
- Quelque chose dans ce genre.
- Gardez votre langue !
Vous en avez toujours trop abusé.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Êtes-vous venu
implorer mon pardon ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Bien, alors, implorez-moi.
De tout mon cœur.
De toute mon âme.
De chaque once de mon être.
Mon Roi, Mon Souverain,
mon redouté seigneur,
je vous implore de pardonner
votre misérable serviteur,
votre humble, insignifiant,
et irréfléchi serviteur,
qui a mérité si peu
et par votre bonté
et votre grâce,
a tant eu.
Le malheureux ingrat que je suis.
Indigne de l'amour de Votre Majesté.
Venez ici !
Si vous pouvez me battre,
vous pourrez revenir à la cour.
Prêt ?
Bon retour.
- Qu'étais-je supposé faire ?
- Je l'ignore.
Mais je suis d'accord avec vous.
C'était grossier et inacceptable.
Je suis déçu par Sa Majesté.
Thomas, je dois vous demander ceci.
Accepteriez-vous
le jugement des cardinaux ?
Quelle importance maintenant ?
Le Pape est libre.
- Il est inutile de faire un conclave.
- Il est plus utile que jamais.
Le Pape est toujours
sous l'emprise de l'Empereur,
Incapable d'avoir
aucun contrôle sur l'Église.
Quelqu'un d'autre doit donc le faire
et je vous le demande encore,
accepteriez-vous
le jugement des cardinaux ?
More...
Si vous n'êtes pas avec moi
maintenant, vous êtes contre moi.
Les enjeux sont plus grands.
Mr. Cromwell m'a dit que le Roi dîne
maintenant avec Norfolk et Boleyn.
Ce sont mes pires ennemis.
Ils cherchent constamment ma chute.
Et si vous ne m'aidez pas,
alors vous les aidez.
Et dois-je vous rappeler ceci,
vous devez tout votre avancement
dans ce monde...
... à moi.
Thomas, nous nous connaissons
depuis fort longtemps.
Je sais que vous vous êtes
toujours plaint de mes méthodes,
ma manière de faire, mais,
au-delà de tout cela, je crois que nous
partageons toujours beaucoup de choses,
nous sommes encore des humanistes,
bien que le monde batte nos croyances,
et compromette nos actions.
aucune chose terrestre, même un prince,
ne compromettra jamais les miennes.
Oh, je vois.
Vous ne voulez pas vous salir les mains.
Je comprends parfaitement.
Malheureusement,
vous n'avez pas le choix.
La main du teinturier
est toujours souillée
par les éléments
avec lesquels il travaille.
Voici mon élément.
Un élément spirituel.
L'élément suprême.
Maintenant, dites-moi,
M'a-t-il souillé ?
Faites-moi savoir quand
les Cardinaux arrivent.
Sa Majesté
le Roi de France.
Mon cher Wolsey,
je pensais que vous le saviez.
Les Cardinaux ne viendront pas.
Il n'y a rien
que je puisse y faire.
Ils ne prennent d'ordre
que de Sa Sainteté.
La roue tourne mon ami.
"Elles me fuient,
me laissant parfois chercher,
Pieds nus,
traquant dans ma chambre.
Remerciant la chance,
cela a été sinon vingt fois mieux,
mais une fois en particulier,
dans une fine parure,
après une plaisante apparence,
quand sa robe lâche
de ses épaules est tombée
elle me prit dans ses bras
longs et menus,
avec toute tendresse me fit un baiser
et me dit doucement :
"Cher amour,
comment aimez-vous cela ?" "
Votre Éminence, bénissez ma fille.
- Soyez bénie, mon enfant.
- Merci, Votre Éminence.
- Votre Éminence, un moment ?
- Non, non.
- Mr. Cromwell.
- Votre Éminence.
- Le Roi vous attend mais...
- Mais quoi ?
Il n'est pas seul.
Majesté...
Alors ?
Majesté, je...
j'espérais que...
Vous pouvez parler franchement
devant Maîtresse Boleyn.
Elle sait tout.
Donc,
vous êtes revenu de Paris !
Oui.
Parlez-nous
de vos succès !
Parlez-nous
de vos nouvelles.
Nous sommes si impatients
de vous entendre.
Oh pour l'amour de Dieu,
ai-je mon divorce ?
Votre Majesté se rappellera
que je suis allé à Paris...
"Ce n'était pas un rêve.
J'étais étendu en plein éveil.
Mais tout a changé, par ma gentillesse,
en un étrange mode d'abandon.
Et j'ai eu congé de sa bonté.
Mais depuis cela,
je suis très aimablement servi.
Je voudrais savoir
ce qu'elle a mérité ! "

<i>Précédemment dans

Je veux un divorce et
vous tâcherez de l'obtenir.
<i>Au début, j'avoue que je ne l'aimais
pas tellement. Mais à présent, je...</i>
Il est de votre devoir d'utiliser
cet amour à notre avantage.
Je sais ce que vous faites.
<i>Mais ne pensez pas
éloigner le Roi de moi.</i>
<i>Il ne pourra
vous donner son cœur,</i>
car je l'ai en ma possession.
Vous êtes si beau Thomas.
Vous êtes un Lord,
que suis-je ?
Un génie !
<i>Allons dans les bois.

Mais sans Brandon.

- Je n'ai pas pardonné à Milord Suffolk.</i>

Que veut Norfolk ?
<i>Il veut que vous nous aidiez

Sir William.
Sir William.
- Qu'a t-il ?
- Va chercher le médecin...
Va le chercher tout de suite.
Bon Dieu, pourquoi personne
ne l'a réveillé ?
Le sommeil dans ces cas est fatal !
Éloignez-vous, éloignez-vous
pauvres fous !
Votre maître à la Suette.
Vous deux, vous,
restez !
Nous devons tenter de le traiter,
pauvre gars.
Retournez-le !
Pour l'amour de Dieu, allez-y !
Nous pouvons encore le sauver.
Je vais lui faire une saignée
dans le dos.
Car j'ai entendu dire que
cela peut parfois marcher,
Ça élimine un peu de toxine
Tenez-le maintenant !
- Que faites-vous ?
- Ne puis-je pas le rencontrer ?
Dieu, femme. Dehors, dehors !
<i>Sa Majesté le Roi et Lady Anne Boleyn.</i>
- Wolsey.
- Votre Majesté.
Maîtresse Anne.
Vous êtes la bienvenue.
Je dois remercier votre éminence,
pour la magnifique broche
que vous m'avez envoyé.
Je suis heureux qu'elle vous ait plus.
C'est une italienne,
j'ai trouvé le façonnage superbe.
Et je suis sûr que votre majesté
sera également ravie,
par les présents envoyés
par le roi de France
Calice d'or!
Tissus d'autel en soie d'or!
Et des tapisseries valant
au moins 30,000 ducats.
Donc, Une fois encore
nous sommes alliés des français.
En effet. Et nous sommes tous les deux
officiellement en guerre
contre l'Empereur.
Bien. Cela me ravi.
Comme il a plu à l'Empereur
d'annoncer la naissance d'un garçon !
Par la Princesse pour laquelle
il a rejeté ma fille.
<i>Vous aurez un garçon.</i>
Comment sont les crevettes, Lady Anne ?
Parfaites, Votre Éminence. Merci.
Vous êtes si généreux.
En tout.
- Alors, qu'en est-il de nos affaires ?
Votre Majesté, Je me suis arrangé
pour envoyer 2 de mes collègues,
deux jeunes avocats,
Stephen Gardiner,
mon secrétaire et Edward Foxe,
pour rencontrer le Pape à Orvieto,
prés de Rome, où il réside encore...
dans des conditions misérables,
apparemment.
Que ferons ces avocats ?
Milady, ils feront comprendre
à Sa Sainteté,
la nécessité de sa coopération.
Il doit reconnaitre selon
les lois civiles et canoniques,
l'invalidité du mariage
de votre majesté.
J'ai lu d'innombrables textes
sur la question.
Parfois à trop lire durant la nuit
cela me donne
d'épouvantables maux de tête...
Mais je suis plus sur
maintenant que jamais
de la justice spirituelle
et légale de mon cas.
Ma conscience est claire !
Comme elle devrait l'être !
Et votre Majesté doit être sure
que ces deux gentlemen,
ces deux trépident avocats,
ne quitteront pas Orvieto,
avant d'avoir obtenu satisfaction.
Bien.
Très bien.
Vous êtes vous entretenu
récemment avec le Roi ?
Non, Votre Majesté.
Le Cardinal Wolsey refuse mes requêtes,
et de la façon la plus autoritaire.
Il ya quelque chose
que j'ai appris des anglais
Un petit avantage
les rend dominateurs,
tandis que l'adversité
la plus légère les rend déprimés.
J'ai reçu une lettre codée
de votre neveu, l'Empereur.
Il vous déclare son appui éternel
dans cette déplaisante affaire.
Vous pouvez m'attendre ici.
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Poursuivez.
Il a déjà rédigé une lettre
à Sa Sainteté le Pape Clément,
le prévenant des brutales
intentions du Roi.
Il a demandé à Clément d'écarter Wolsey
comme représentant officiel.
et de déclare que vous et le Roi
êtes légalement marié.
Il vous dit de rester forte.
Je m'efforce de l'être.
Mais tant de choses sont
maintenant cachées en moi.
Dites-lui que je crois en lui
plus que nul autre.
Excepté en Dieu !
- Maitresse Hastings.
- Dr. Linacre ?
Dés qu'il a su la nouvelle,
le Roi m'a envoyé ici.
Hélas en vain !
Maitresse Hastings, je sais que
vous étiez sa concubine.
Il était en tout cas,
le plus aimant et aimé des hommes.
Sa Majesté regrettera
beaucoup sa camaraderie.
- Laissez-moi le voir.
- Le risque est grave
et nous n'en savons que très peu.
Je vous en pris.
Mon pauvre chéri...
Excusez-moi.
Vous devez brûler toute
sa literie et ses vêtements.
Avant tout,
il devra être enterré.
Messieurs, ceci est une lettre
du roi pour le Pape,
le remerciant d'avance pour l'attention
bienveillante qu'il a pour sa requête.
Quelle réponse de Sa Sainteté
prévoyez-vous ?
En toute honnêteté, Mr. Gardiner,
je n'en suis pas tout à fait sure.
Le Pape subissait la maltraitance
des mercenaires de l'Empereur.
Et bien que, selon la rumeur, l'Empereur
lui a permis de s'échapper à Orvieto,
sa condition continue à être médiocre.
Il mène une vie triste, enfermé
dans un château en ruine.
Dans ce cas, pourquoi le Pape
favoriserait-il l'Empereur
qui lui a causé que de la misère
au dépend du Roi d'Angleterre,
qui ne lui a jamais fait de mal ?
Le problème est, Votre Éminence,
que les épées du Roi d'Angleterre
sont plus éloignées
que celles de l'Empereur.
La diplomatie est presque toujours
réglée par une telle proximité.
Vous parlez comme un véritable avocat !
Mais si tout cela échouent,
utilisez les menaces.
Dites à sa sainteté, que si le roi
ne peut obtenir satisfaction
de la cour du Pape...
il trouvera d'autres moyens
pour apaiser sa conscience et se
débarrasser de sa femme actuelle.
Ais-je été assez clair ?
Oui, Éminence.
Nous avons compris.
À la grâce de Dieu, messieurs.
Le soir après la mort de William,
ses serviteurs ont commencé
à voler ses effets.
Dans son testament,
il a légué ceci au Roi.
J'ai tenu à le préserver.
William est enterré dans le cimetière.
Y sont aussi les pauvres serviteurs
qui l'ont attrapé,
et sont mort de la suette
dans les dernières 24 heures.
<i>Vim Compton</i>
Je ne sais pas quoi vous dire.
- Milord Norfolk.
- Éminence.
- Votre Éminence.
- Que voulez-vous ?
J'ai un mot à vous dire,
si je puis.
En privé.
Très bien.
On vous ordonne de retourner
immédiatement à vos propriétés
dans l'est d'Anglie.
Comment ?
Et par qui ?
Par Sa Majesté.
De ses propres mains.
Pourquoi ?
Sa majesté veut que vous
y supervisiez la production de blé
et le commerce dans la mer du Nord.
Le commerce ?
Le commerce...
Pourquoi m'éloignez-vous ?
Fils de boucher !
Ainsi que vous pouvez voir, Milord,
ce ne sont pas mes ordres.
Pauvre William !
Est-ce tout ce qu'il reste
de toute sa vie ?
Nous devons faire que ces bijoux
reviennent à son infortunée Lady.
William est mort à Warwickshire
qui est assez éloignée d'ici,
et s'il plaît à Dieu,
la maladie ne s'étendra pas.
Mais vous devrez vous fortifier
contre dans tout les cas.
Bien, ceci sont des plâtres
pour guérir les ulcères.
Celui-ci est un onguent, qui calme
l'inflammation et arrête
les démangeaisons.
Celui-ci aide la digestion,
celui-ci apaise la peau sèche...
Et cet onguent soulage votre verge
si elle est endolorie.
Merci.
Celles-ci sont appelées
les pilules de Rasis,
Elles portent le nom du Turc
qui les a inventées.
Ils disent qu'elles sont
efficaces contre la suette.
Mais cette infusion
est encore meilleure.
Qu'est ce que c'est ?
C'est un mélange de souci, de Manus
Christi, une herbe très efficace,
oseille,
plante de pré,
Vinaigre de lin,
copeaux d'ivoire,
Le tout mélangé à du sucre.
Prenez-en.
En êtes vous sur ?
On m'a dit que la prise d'infusions
était la plus mauvaise chose.
Croyez-moi.
Vous vous sentirez malade.
Mais c'est mieux que la maladie
qu'il prévient !
Maitresse Hastings.
Enterrez-là à coté de Sir William.
C'est très beau.
C'est en l'honneur d'un ami.
Excusez-moi je ne peux travailler,
à moins que je ne sois...
Bien sur, bonne nuit,
Thomas Tallis.
Attendez !
Quel est votre nom ?
Joan.
Restez un moment.
Pourquoi moi ?
Pensez-vous que le monde vous juge
toutes les deux de la même manière ?
Oui, il me semble.
Je ne crois pas.
Je vois la différence
entre vous deux.
Quand je vous regarde, je vois
une lumière vous entourant.
Une lumière ?
Vous voulez dire,
comme un halo ?
Oui ! comme un cercle de lumière.
Vous êtes mystérieux.
Puis-je vous embrasser, Joan ?
Bonjour, Chambellan.
Votre Majesté,
puis-je vous présenter
son altesse Jean de Bellay,
Evêque de Bayonne,
le nouvel ambassadeur français.
<i>- Bienvenue monsieur.
- Votre Majesté.</i>
Majesté, Je suis heureux de
présenter mes lettres de créance.
Et moi d'être, une fois encore,
l'ami et l'allié de votre Maître.
Remerciez-le pour
ses précieux cadeaux.
C'est un plaisir, Votre Altesse !
Alors, Votre Excellence,
comment se déroule la guerre
contre l'Empereur ?
Votre Majesté n'a aucune
raison de s'inquiéter.
Une armée française et
une flotte de nos alliés les Génois
ont assiégé les soldats
de l'Empereur à Naples.
Tôt ou tard, Charles devra se rendre
et quitter totalement l'Italie.
Ce sont vraiment
d'excellentes nouvelles.
Votre Excellence,
- laissez moi vous présenter...
- N'est ce pas Mademoiselle Anne ?
Son Éminence, le Cardinal Wolsey,
m'a tout dit sur vous.
Mais il ne m'a pas dit
comme vous êtes belle.
Pour un français,
c'est presque un crime.
Comment l'as-t-on appelée ?
Wolsey.
Vous devez être heureuse, ma chérie.
Son Excellence vient de m'informer
que l'empereur
bientôt sera défait
et chassé hors d'Italie.
Il ne pourra plus
empêcher notre bonheur.
<i>Retourne à ton épouse !</i>
Arrêtez-vous ?
Au nom du Roi !
Quelqu'un a-t-il parlé ?
Quelle est cette puanteur ?
C'est le vinaigre.
Du vinaigre, Excellence.
- Que ce passe-il ?
- Il y a une épidémie dans la ville.
300 morts de la suette,
uniquement aujourd'hui.
Ramenez le Dr. Linacre.
Rapidement.
- Qu'en est-il de ma femme, la Reine ?
- Le médecin va venir bientôt.
Anne ! n'ayez crainte,
je vous verrais bientôt.
George, emmenez votre sœur
à ses appartements !
<i>Allez, allez !</i>
L'expérience m'a appris, votre majesté,
que dans beaucoup de cas, avant toute
apparition de symptômes physiques,
les victimes subissent une curieuse
désorientation mentale,
un sens aigu
de peur et d'appréhension,
un pressentiment de douleur et de mort.
Chaque rumeur les met
dans un état d'agitation.
En effet, une rumeur peut causer
un millier de cas de Suette.
Ainsi des milliers contractent
la maladie,
d'une crainte injustifiée.
En particuliers, s'ils observent
un régime sain.
Un régime sain ?
Cela est votre meilleur remède,
Dr. Linacre ?
- Pas les infusions ?
J'espère que votre majesté
me croit quand je vous dis
qu'il y a des remèdes innombrables
pour la suette,
la plupart d'entre eux, à mon avis,
sont médicalement inefficaces.
Même pour la prévenir ?
Bien, j'ai entendu parler
d'une théorie intéressante.
Un jeune monsieur de ma
connaissance jure
Qu'il peut combattre
la maladie directement
en se faisant suer naturellement
par de l'exercice toutes les nuits.
Merci, Docteur.
<i>Apporter les morts.</i>
<i>Avez-vous des morts ?</i>
Ma chère épouse et famille.
Ce fléau qui est tombé sur nous,
est une punition de Dieu.
Nous sommes tous des pécheurs
et Dieu est mécontent de nous.
Notre vie et notre mort
sont entre ses mains.
Tout que nous pouvons faire est de prier
et faire appel à sa grande
et infinie pitié...
Et reconnaissons
nos natures coupables
et notre besoin de sa grâce.
Alors qu'en pensez vous ?
N'est ce pas la meilleure
façon de suer ?
Oui, votre Grace.
Faites-la léchée
par votre mari !
Qu'y a t-il mon enfant ?
Rien, madame, je...
Je me sens juste un peu étourdie.
Venez ici.
Non, je...
J'ai encore des vertiges, je...
C'est cela ?
J'ai attrapé la suante ?
Non ma chère enfant.
C'est juste une migraine.
Pas plus que cela.
Ça n'est pas cela ! J'ai...
J'ai mal au... au ventre.
Oui ! N'est ce pas un signe ?
Comment pouvez-vous le nier ?
Je vais mourir !
Non, vous n'allez pas mourir.
Écoutez-moi. Vous n'allez
pas mourir. D'accord !
<i>Ma pauvre domestique a, ce jour,
attrapé la Suette et en est morte.</i>
<i>J'implore votre Majesté.
Que dois je faire ?</i>
Je veux la voir.
je conseillerais d'éviter tout contact
avec des personnes infectées,
ou ceux qui ont eu contact
avec des personnes infectées.
Vous êtes le Roi d'Angleterre.
Oui, mais si...
Si elle venait à mourir ?
Très bien. Dites-lui qu'elle
doit quitter le palais,
elle doit repartir avec son père à Hever
Et par tous les moyens
s'enfermée là-bas.
Je lui enverrait des infusions
pour la fortifiée.
et je lui écrirait.
Et au sujet de Sa Majesté la Reine ?
La Reine rejoindra notre fille à Ludlow.
Je pris Dieu qu'elles soient
en sécurité au pays de Galles.
Et vous, votre Majesté ?
Je m'enfermerai ici,
et gardez la Suette à distance
par tout les moyens.
Alors si je peux donner un conseil
à Votre Majesté,
Garder le moins de personnes
possible près de vous,
de cette manière vous pourrez
réduire le risque de contamination.
Dieu nous bénisse tous les deux.
En effet.
Je suis venu vous dire au revoir.
Êtes-vous heureux me faire partir ?
Ne voulez-vous pas voir notre fille ?
M'éloignez-vous
pour rester avec elle ?
Non, elle n'est pas...
Voulez-vous dire
Lady Anne Boleyn ?
Oui, je veux dire Lady Anne Boleyn.
Il n'y a plus de secret à son propos.
Non, elle est retournée à Hever
Une de ses domestiques
est morte de la suette.
Et votre peur de la Suante
est plus grande que votre
engouement pour votre maîtresse ?
Catherine, elle n'est pas ma maîtresse.
Je ne couche pas avec elle.
Pas tant que nous sommes
encore mariés.
Mais lui avez-vous dis
que vous l'aimiez ?
Lui avez-vous fait des promesses ?
Vous a-t-elle fait des promesses ?
Ne me dites pas encore que
"tant que je suis encore votre femme."
Catherine, j'espère de tout mon cœur
que vous accepterez que notre mariage
était basé sur un mensonge.
En attendant,
Je vous aime encore assez
pour vouloir sauver votre vie.
Maintenant faites ce que j'ordonne.
Partez au Pays de Galles.
Quand vous parlez ainsi, mon amour...
Vous agissez comme si j'avais la peste.
Comme si l'amour était la peste.
Je vous écrirais.
Dites à Marie que le Roi, son père,
lui envois son amour et son attention.
Comment vous sentez-vous ?
Je me sens bien, Papa.
Vous êtes sure ?
Que dites vous ?
À cause de ma domestique,
je suis certaine d'être contaminé ?
Non, bien sur que non.
Qu'y a t-il ?
- Je ne peux respirer.
- Comment ?
- Que se passe t-il ?
- Je ne peux respirer.
Je ne peux respirer,
arrêtez la voiture !
- Halte!
- Arrêtez la voiture !
Anne ?
Roulez !
Anne !
- Oh Joan... ma chère sœur.
Mon père, Il est dit et su
que la maladie est une épreuve de Dieu
et une punition pour nos péchés.
Mais pourquoi, mon père ?
Pourquoi mon pays est-il
si désigné pour la disgrâce ?
Qu'avons-nous fait qui ait tant
déplu à Dieu tout-puissant
pour qu'il attire cette
pestilence sur nous ?
Est-ce ma faute ?
Mon père,
je demande le pardon
pour les péchés inconnus.
Et je vous implore
de m'accorder votre bénédiction.
Pas en tant que Roi,
mais comme un homme.
S'il vous plaît, mon père.
Mon père ?
Mon père ?
Mon père ?
Bonjour.
Etes-vous les émissaires anglais ?
Je vous en pris. Venez !
Les Invités Anglais,
Mr. Gardiner et Mr. Foxe.
Mes fils...
Saint Père.
Voyez-vous comment
je suis forcé de vivre ?
Pouvez-vous imaginer
la misère de votre Père ?
Les Espagnols sont pratiquement
à mon seuil.
Votre Sainteté connait
la raison de notre présence.
Nous amenons un courrier
de Sa Majesté, le Roi Henri,
le plus dévoué et catholique roi,
d'Angleterre, d'Irlande et de France.
Sa Majesté remercie, d'avance,
votre Sainteté
pour votre soutien
à sa requête d'annulation.
Il sait que vous, Saint-Père, ne ferez
pas d'objection à nos supplications.
J'espère de tout mon cœur,
ravir et satisfaire votre Maître.
Mais je dois vous dire,
en toute honnêteté,
dieu m'en ait témoin,
et en tant qu'honnête homme,
que j'ai été informé que cette requête
est incitée seulement
par l'affection vaine du Roi
et l'amour excessif pour
cette femme, Anne Boleyn.
Il m'a été dit que
le roi d'Angleterre désire
divorcer uniquement pour
"des raisons privées",
et que la femme qu'il aime
est bien en deçà de lui.
Non seulement dans le rang,
mais également dans la vertu.
Votre Sainteté, qui vous
a dit de pareilles choses ?
Ils disent qu'Anne est déjà enceinte,
Et que le Roi souhaite instamment
faire de son enfant l'héritier du trône.
Lady Anne est un modèle de chasteté.
Quoique très apte à procréer,
quand le moment viendras.
Saint-Père, elle impressionne
toute personne qui la voit,
ou qui la connait
par la pureté de sa vie,
sa constante virginité, sa sobriété,
sa soumission, son humilité...
- Comme toutes les femmes d'Angleterre,
Elle est de loin la plus convenable
pour devenir Reine.
Mais qu'advient-il
de la Reine Catherine ?
Sa Majesté espère que, lorsque
votre Sainteté aura pris connaissance
des arguments légaux que
nous avons apportés avec nous,
vous écrirez à la Reine
pour hâter son accord.
Bien sur.
Mais d'abord,
je dois lire ces arguments...
Ne dois-je pas ?
Avant d'arriver à un jugement.
Sa Majesté nous a aussi
fait comprendre que,
si vous ne pouviez
lui donner satisfaction,
il cherchera alors un jugement ailleurs.
Il pourrait être contraint de vivre à
l'extérieur des lois de la Sainte Église
et au-delà de l'autorité
de Votre Sainteté.
Mes fils.
Garçon...
<i>Faites attention !</i>
Mes fils.
- Saint Père !
- Saint Père !
Je crains que vous ne soyez
déçu par ma réponse.
Je suis incapable d'émettre
un jugement, en ce lieu et jour,
concernant le cas du Roi.
Attendez ! je n'ai pas dis que
c'était la fin de cette affaire.
Je suis résolu à la régler
aussitôt que possible...
Mais pas ici.
Vous voyez comment je suis ici.
Ainsi, j'ai nommé
le Cardinal Campeggio
en tant que représentant officiel.
Une fois que la maladie dans votre
pays aura pris fin, il partira
pour l'Angleterre
et ensemble avec le Cardinal Wolsey,
Constituera une cour
pour écouter et décider
du bien-fondé de ce cas.
Si votre roi est aussi certain
de sa justesse que vous le dites,
alors sans doute
il appréciera ces mesures,
lesquelles peuvent hâter
l'accomplissement de ses désirs.
Entrez !
Posez les là-bas !
<i>Votre Majesté doit savoir que, sa grâce,</i>
<i>le Duc de Norfolk,
ayant contracté la Suette,</i>
<i>a demandé l'autorisation
de rentrer à Londres,</i>
<i>apparemment pour voir un Docteur.</i>
<i>Je lui ai refusé cette permission
au nom de votre majesté.</i>
<i>Trois des apothicaires
de votre Majesté</i>
<i>sont également tombé malades,</i>
<i>alors que trois de vos
valets de chambres sont morts.</i>
<i>Votre maçon, Redman, est également mort.</i>
<i>La maladie ne montre
aucun signe d'apaisement.</i>
<i>Il y a maintenant 40,000 cas
à Londres seul.</i>
Lady Anne Boleyn est aussi malade,
cependant elle reste vivante.
- Dr. Linacre !
- Oui, Votre Majesté ?
Lady Anne est malade.
Lady Anne Boleyn.
Allez immédiatement
au Château de Hever.
et pour l'amour de Dieu,
sauvez-là.
À mon avis,
il n'ya pas d'espoir.
Les signes vitaux sont faibles
et se dégradent.
Le prêtre devrait l'assisté
maintenant, in extremis.
Je suis désolé.
N'êtes-vous pas effrayé, papa ?
De quoi, de la mort ?
Non, je me suis mis entièrement
entre les mains de Dieu,
et je sais avec certitude qu'a ma mort
j'irai dans un bien meilleur
endroit que celui-ci.
Ce que vous voyez autour de vous,
chérie, n'est pas la peur de la mort,
Mais la crainte, pour le non repenti,
de ce qui va la suivre.
Il y a un spectre hantant l'Europe
que je crains beaucoup plus
que la Suante.
Une maladie s'étendant partout,
Infectant par milliers.
De quoi parlez-vous, papa?
La maladie du Luthéranisme.
Il s'étend parmi les pauvres.
Ceux qui voient l'église
riche, corrompu et décadente.
Il a déjà enflammé
les paysans en Allemagne,
et tué plus de 100,000 personnes.
La contagion s'est maintenant
étendue à la Bourgogne, Salzbourg,
Montpellier et Nantes.
Chaque jour apporte plus de nouvelles
de la virulence de cette hérésie.
Assurément, ils ne viendront pas ici ?
Ils sont déjà là.
Nous savons que des réunions secrètes
ont lieu ici dans la Ville de Londres,
pendant lesquelles
l'église est attaquée,
des livres infâmes distribués.
Laissez-moi vous demander,
mon enfant.
Je vous le demande.
Que feriez-vous à une maison
qui est infectée par la maladie ?
Vous la purgé par le feu.
C'est exactement cela.
De la même manière alors, la maladie
qui est dans la maison de la foi
sera purgée par le feu.
Il est vrai que je suis contre
la violence, comme vous le savez.
Mais je suis persuadé que
Luther et ses disciples
devront être saisi,
tout de suite et brûlé.
<i>Votre Majesté, multitudes
de gens meurent autour de nous.</i>
<i>Presque tout le monde à Oxford,
Cambridge et Londres</i>
<i>a été malade récemment...</i>
<i>Depuis que le Cardinal
est tombé malade,</i>
<i>et que votre majesté
êtes partie de la cour,</i>
<i>il n'ya réellement pas
de gouvernement au royaume.</i>
<i>Il ya eu quelques
émeutes dans la ville,</i>
<i>mais rien qui puisse alarmer
votre majesté.</i>
- Sir !
- Venez la voir !
- Appelez le maître.
- Milord ! Milord !
- Papa! Papa venez vite !
- George...
Savez-vous ce que
vous avez fait, mon enfant ?
Vous avez ressuscité.
À présent, vous pourrez revoir
le Roi, à nouveau.
Ça sera comme avant !
<i>Je remercie Dieu, ma chérie,</i>
<i> vous êtes sauve
et le fléau est enrayé.</i>
<i>Le légat que nous attendons
est arrivé à Paris.</i>
<i>Dimanche ou lundi dernier.</i>
<i>J'espère son arrivée à Calais
pour Lundi prochain,</i>
<i>et je compte dans peu de temps
apprécier ce dont j'ai tant eu envie,</i>
<i>pour le plaisir de Dieu et le nôtre.</i>
<i>À présent, plus de temps à perdre,
ma chérie,</i>
<i>je voudrais que vous soyez
dans mes bras ou moi dans les vôtres,</i>
<i>le temps est long
depuis notre dernier baisé.</i>
Vous avez une lettre
de Lady Anne Boleyn.
<i>Mon cher Lord,</i>
<i>Je suis enchanté de savoir
que vous avez survécu à la Suette.</i>
<i>Tout les jours de ma vie,
je suis très attaché,</i>
<i>à toutes les créatures,
proches de la grâce du roi.</i>
<i>Pour aimer et servir votre grâce.</i>
<i>Je vous prie de ne jamais douter, que
mon avis envers vous ne changera jamais,</i>
<i>aussi longtemps
qu'il reste un souffle de vie en moi.</i>
<i>Votre humble servante
Anne Boleyn.</i>
Bien, au moins elle a
le sens de l'humour.
Prenez des dispositions pour
mon pèlerinage à Walsingham.
Je dois des remerciements
à notre Lady.
Merci.
Dieu merci.
<i>Précédemment dans
" The Tudors "</i>
Ce fléau qui est tombé sur nous,
est une punition de Dieu.
Nous sommes tous des pécheurs
et Dieu est mécontent de nous.
Notre vie et notre mort
sont entre ses mains.
Vous rentrez de Paris,
Alors, nous sommes une fois
encore alliés aux Français.
Et nous sommes tous les deux
en guerre contre l'Empereur.
Ai-je obtenu mon divorce ?
Je me suis arrangé pour envoyer
deux jeunes avocats,
pour rencontrer le Pape
à Orvieto, près de Rome
J'ai nommé le Cardinal Campeggio
en tant que représentant officiel.
Une fois que la maladie dans votre pays
sera finie, il partira pour l'Angleterre
et constituera une cour
avec le Cardinal Wolsey
pour décider
du bien-fondé de ce cas.
Norfolk m'a envoyé.
Mais Norfolk me hait.
il y a quelqu'un
qu'il hait plus encore.
Il veut que vous nous aidiez
à détruire Wolsey,
More, si vous n'êtes pas avec moi
maintenant, vous êtes contre moi.
Le Roi dîne maintenant
avec Norfolk et Boleyn.
Ce sont mes pires ennemis.
Et si vous ne m'aidez pas,
alors vous les aidez !
Thomas Tallis,
nous aimons votre musique.
- Restez un moment.
- Pourquoi moi ?
Quand je vous regarde, je vois
une lumière vous entourant.
Ma sœur...
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Je ne peux respirer, arrêtez.
Je ne peux respirer !
- Arrêtez la voiture !
- Arrêtez !
Lady Anne est souffrante,
pour l'amour de Dieu,
sauvez-la.
Savez-vous ce que
vous avez fait, mon enfant ?
Vous avez ressuscité.
À présent, vous pouvez
revoir le Roi.
Ce sera comme avant !
Merci.
Dieu merci.
<i>Vous pensiez connaître l'Histoire.</i>
<i>Mais vous ne connaissez que la fin.</i>
<i>Pour aller au cœur de l'Histoire,</i>

Votre Grâce, Son Éminence
le Cardinal Campeggio.
Lorenzo, mon vieil ami.
Mon cher Wolsey.
Venez.
Votre Grâce doit excuser
mon incapacité.
Dieu m'a donné la goutte,
en guise d'épreuve.
À présent...
Sa Majesté est très désireux
que la cour de décision
soit établie immédiatement
pour étudier
le cas de son divorce...
En effet, en effet.
J'ai la permission du Pape
pour statuer sur cette question.
Et de ma décision,
il ne pourra y avoir aucun appel.
Et déjà...
Si Votre Grâce a un peu d'eau.
De l'eau !
Mélangée à un peu de vin ?
Et déjà ?
Vous et moi sommes de vieux amis.
Et nous sommes tout les deux
des gens du monde, Cardinal Wolsey.
J'ai même un fils
qui voyage avec moi.
Et donc ?
Sa Sainteté souhaite
satisfaire le Roi,
aussi difficile que cela puisse être.
Mais dans nos
intérêts communs,
ne serait-il pas préférable
que nous tentions
de persuader Sa Majesté
de renoncer à ce divorce ?
Il est certain que
sa passion pour cette...
fille, va s'altérer
et disparaître avec le temps,
inévitablement,
comme toute passion.
Je crains que Votre Éminence
ne soit venue ici dans l'ignorance.
Laissez-moi vous éclairer
sur certains points.
Si vous n'accordez pas
au Roi son divorce,
l'autorité du Pape
en Angleterre sera annihilée.
Vous devriez vous rappeler qu'une grande
partie de l'Allemagne s'est déjà séparée
de Rome...
La même chose arrivera ici.
Cela signifierait la ruine
totale du royaume.
Y a-t-il un risque qu'ils déclarent
votre mariage valide ?
Wolsey m'a assuré que le Pape
a déjà tranché en ma faveur.
Le procès est juste pour les apparences
et une manière d'apaiser l'Empereur.
Nous pouvons donc
planifier notre mariage ?
Oui.
Oui, mon amour.
Il y a autre chose, toujours
pour préserver les apparences.
Pour quelques temps, je devrais
partager la table de Catherine.
Et parfois sa couche.
- Sa couche ?
- Ce n'est rien !
Mes avocats m'ont simplement averti
que faire autrement pourrait
entraîner des poursuites.
Cela serait vu comme une atteinte
à ses droits conjugaux.
Vous pensez que coucher à nouveau
avec votre épouse n'est rien ?
Que croyez-vous qu'il va se passer ?
Ce qui se passe d'habitude !
Votre confiance en moi est réduite !
Je vous fais confiance !
Je vous aime !
Catherine n'est pas
à blâmer. Ni moi.
Mais le fait est, Excellence, que
nous avons rompu la loi de Dieu,
pour laquelle il ne peut y avoir
aucune dérogation.
Vous comprenez comme cela touche
profondément ma conscience
et que je veuille que cela soit
résolu le plus vite possible ?
Je comprends et je compatis.
Ainsi que Sa Sainteté,
naturellement.
Mais Sa Sainteté a aussi proposé
à Votre Majesté...
... une autre solution possible.
J'ai déjà expliqué à votre Éminence
que Sa Majesté...
Non, non, non. S'il vous plaît.
Ce n'est pas la même chose, mon ami.
Cette solution devrait
plaire à Sa Majesté.
Quelle est-elle ?
Sa Sainteté est consciente
de la grande piété de la Reine.
Elle en a elle-même parlé. Son amour
pour la mère de Dieu, les saints, etc.
Et il se demande si Sa Majesté
pourrait être convaincue
comme Jeanne de Valois,
l'épouse occasionnelle de Louis XII,
d'abdiquer son mariage
et de se retirer au couvent.
Qu'en pensez-vous, Wolsey ?
Eh bien, cela accélérerait
certainement la question,
et ça nous épargnerait
la douleur d'un procès.
Et, puisque ce serait volontaire,
cela n'offensera pas
son neveu, l'Empereur.
Et de plus,
cela procurera à Sa Majesté
une retraite honorable.
Vous le lui soumettrez,
tout de suite !
Majesté.
Votre Majesté pourrait-elle au moins
considérer la proposition ?
Je vous donnerai
ma réponse en temps utile,
après en avoir parlé
au Roi, mon mari.
Mon Père, pourriez-vous
me prendre en confession ?
Oui, mon enfant.
- Votre Majesté.
- Votre Éminence.
Votre Majesté.
Je vous prie de céder
à la volonté du Roi.
Et quelle est sa volonté ?
Comme l'a proposé Son Éminence,
que vous rejoigniez une communauté
religieuse de votre choix
et fassiez vœu
de chasteté perpétuelle.
Vous me parlez de chasteté ?
N'avez-vous pas une maîtresse
et deux enfants, Votre Éminence ?
Votre Majesté entame
la 3éme période de sa vie.
Vous avez passé les deux premières
à donner l'exemple au monde.
Avec cet acte, vous pourriez sceller
toutes vos bonnes actions.
Levez-vous, Votre Grâce.
Il n'est pas convenable pour
un homme de votre dignité
d'être vu suppliant en public,
quelqu'en soit la cause.
Éminence...
- Alors, vous avez parlé à Campeggio ?
- Oui.
Je lui ai dit que je ne pouvais répondre
sans la permission de Votre Majesté.
Et quelle réponse lui donnerez-vous ?
Je lui dirai la vérité.
Catherine !
Tout le monde sait maintenant
que notre mariage était injuste.
Vous-même devez le reconnaître ! Alors,
à moins que vous ne consentiez à prendre
le voile, je vais devoir vous y forcer.
Me permettez-vous
de parler à Campeggio ?
Je ne lui parlerais pas
si vous refusez.
Milady.
Lady Anne.
Maître Cromwell.
Avez-vous... Avez-vous
un message du Roi ?
Je pense que nous
nous comprenons.
Un ami commun,
un certain M. Fish,
en exil en Hollande, m'a envoyé
un présent à votre attention.
Quel est-il, Maître Cromwell ?
"L'Obédience du Chrétien"
par William Tyndale.
Il contient de bonnes
critiques sur la papauté
et sur l'arrogance
et l'abus des prêtres.
Vous le trouverez très instructif.
Mais soyez toujours prudente
et ne le montrez pas à tous.
Le fait même de le posséder
pourrait passer pour de l'hérésie.
Et Wolsey est encore assez puissant
pour persécuter
les hérétiques,
ainsi que l'on nous appelle,
ceux qui embrassent
la vraie religion.
Je le ferais.
Et que Dieu vous bénisse,
Maître Cromwell.
Attendez.
Pourriez-vous remettre
cela au Roi...
avec mon amour.
Milady.
Viens ici.
Ma poule...
Pou...
Gentille poule.
Ne fuis pas !
Je t'ai eue.
Vous ne m'avez
même pas dit votre nom.
- Jane.
- Jane.
Pourquoi avez-vous quitté la cour ?
Quand votre sœur est morte...
Ma sœur est toujours ici,
Thomas Tallis.
Elle ne m'a pas quittée.
Elle ne peut pas me quitter.
Vous pouvez la voir aussi,
n'est-ce pas ?
Je suis venu de Londres.
Et je voudrais vraiment
que vous reveniez à la cour.
Pourquoi ?
Vous préfériez ma sœur à moi.
Je pouvais le voir.
Je veux vous épouser, Jane.
<i>In nomine patris et filii
et spiritus sancti. Amen. </i>
Que voulez-vous confesser ?
Mon père, je voudrais vous parler de mon
premier mariage avec le Prince Arthur,
le frère aîné de Sa Majesté.
Je sais de quoi vous parlez.
Continuez.
Il ne m'a jamais touché.
Je vous le jure,
sur le serment sacré.
j'étais "intatta e incorrotta da lui
come venne dal ventre di sue madre."
Je veux être clair, vous dites que
le Prince Arthur ne vous
a pas touchée et vous a préservée,
comme lorsque vous êtes sortie
du ventre de votre mère ?
Oui, mon Père.
Vous êtes donc arrivée
dans la couche du Roi,
vierge, "intatta e incorrotta" ?
Oui, mon Père.
Mon Père, je vous le dis
en toute humilité,
je ne peux accéder
à votre requête.
Je suis l'épouse véritable
et légitime de Sa Majesté,
donc votre proposition
est inadmissible.
Quoiqu'il arrive,
je vivrai et mourrai
dans cette vocation au mariage
à laquelle Dieu m'a appelé.
Je comprends.
De plus,
je vous donne la permission
de briser le sceau de la confession
et de raconter au monde entier
ce que je vous ai dit !
Henri veut votre retour à la cour.
Après tout, vous êtes sa soeur.
Comment puis-je revenir tant
qu'il s'affiche avec sa souillon ?
Cela serait vu comme une
reconnaissance de sa ridicule liaison.
Margaret, nous devons rester
dans les bonnes grâces du Roi,
ou nous ne sommes rien.
Laissez-le épouser qui il veut.
Cela a toujours été votre philosophie,
n'est-ce pas, Charles ?
Tellement cynique.
Est-ce pour cela que vous
fréquentez ce diable de Boleyn ?
Vous l'aimiez bien quand
il nous a aidés à revenir à la cour.
Ou étiez-vous simplement cynique ?
Je ne comprenais pas son jeu.
Maintenant si.
Je le méprise.
Moi aussi !
Mais je hais Wolsey plus encore.
C'est un mariage d'opportunité.
Un peu comme le nôtre ?
Non. Je vous aimais.
Vous ignorez le sens
de ce mot, Charles.
Vous pouvez aimer,
peut-être pour un an,
un mois ou un jour...
même pour une heure.
Et durant cette heure,
je crois vraiment que vous
aimez aussi passionnément...
que tout homme.
Mais l'heure passée,
vous n'aimez plus.
Vous aimez une autre,
puis une autre.
Votre amour...
est le plus généreux
et le plus nuisible.
- Margaret...
- Ne faites pas l'idiot, Charles.
Cela ne vous va pas.
Éminence.
Je dois voir le Cardinal Campeggio.
Pardonnez-moi.
Mon père... est indisposé.
En tout cas, il n'y a rien qu'il
puisse faire pour l'instant.
Il a envoyé ses rapports à Rome
et doit attendre
les réponses de Sa Sainteté.
Et en attendant,
Mon pauvre père doit se reposer
et reprendre des forces.
- Lady Anne.
- Bonsoir, Lady Anne.
Est-ce la Maîtresse Boleyn ?
Oui. C'est elle.
La fille pour laquelle le Roi
veut sacrifier son mariage
à la plus gracieuse
et charmante des reines.
J'ai tenté de l'éloigner
de cette voie,
mais je jurerais qu'un ange descendant
du ciel ne l'en dissuaderait pas.
Pensez-vous qu'ils ont emmené
les choses vers la jonction ultime ?
J'ai reçu une pétition des Ducs de
Suffolk et de Norfolk et de Lord Boleyn,
disant que le divorce a l'appui
écrasant du peuple anglais.
Votre Éminence
découvrirait rapidement,
à l'extérieur de ses portes,
en observant les gens
que cela est un mensonge manifeste.
Au contraire, les gens aiment leur reine
et ont toutes les raisons de le faire.
Excusez-moi.
Wolsey !
Sa Majesté a refusé l'offre.
Êtes-vous surpris ?
Cependant, Campeggio m'a dit
que le Pape était prêt
à envisager de légitimer
tout enfant
que vous pourriez avoir
avec Maîtresse Boleyn,
que vous soyez mariés ou pas.
Êtes-vous fou ?
Vous devrez faire
beaucoup mieux que cela.
Pardonnez-moi,
Ambassadeur Mendoza.
Je suis nouveau à cette cour.
Qui sont ces hommes
qui s'adressent au Roi ?
Lord Rochford est
le père d'Anne Boleyn
et Norfolk est son oncle.
Avec le Duc de Suffolk, ils sont
les ennemis jurés de Wolsey.
Et nul ne l'ignore à la cour.
Ils ne reculeraient devant rien
pour le détruire.
Le Roi l'aime-t-il encore ?
Pas autant qu'avant, je suppose.
Mais le Cardinal ne doit
pas être sous-estimé.
Puis-je connaître vos impressions
sur les affaires du Roi ?
Il n'est pas tenu secret
que l'Empereur est outragé
du comportement du Roi
à l'égard de la Reine.
Et je peux vous dire,
en toute confidentialité,
qu'il a écrit à Sa Sainteté, exigeant
que la question soit tranchée
à Rome, et non pas ici.
Il ne chercherait pas à s'immiscer
d'une autre façon ?
De quelle autre façon ?
Bien, si la Reine venait à renoncer,
pourrait-il considérer une intervention
militaire en son nom ?
Il n'en a pas dit mot.
- Quelqu'un lui en a parlé ?
- Non.
Pas encore.
- Votre Majesté.
- Margaret...
Pas elle !
Elle ne le mérite pas.
Ce n'est rien qu'une roturière.
Ouvrez les yeux.
Regardez-la !
Regardez-vous !
Regardez votre propre mariage.
Comment allez-vous ?
Je brûle.
Je brûle d'impatience.
Milady, l'Archevêque Warham
et l'évêque Tunstall
voudraient vous rencontrer.
Messieurs,
je comprends que vous êtes parmi mes
conseillers pour la cour de légation.
En tant qu'honorables personnes,
dont le devoir premier est
envers Dieu et votre conscience,
vous êtes les bienvenus.
- Venez-vous au nom du Roi ?
- Oui, Votre Majesté.
Nous devons parler de votre plaidoirie.
Je n'ai rien contre Sa Majesté,
que j'aime de tout mon être,
mais seulement contre ses conseillers
et une certaine dame dont les ambitions
peuvent ruiner un royaume.
Madame, nous ne sommes pas ici
pour discuter de la plaidoirie,
- Ou de choses de ce genre.
- Mais...
Nous sommes venus
pour vous signaler, Madame,
que des rumeurs de complots contre
la vie de sa Majesté se sont répandues
ainsi que contre
le Cardinal Campeggio.
Si pareil complot venait à aboutir,
il serait donc clair que
vous et votre fille
seriez suspectées de participation.
Je ne peux croire que le Roi
donnerait foi à de telles rumeurs,
puisqu'il sait, et vous aussi,
que j'estime la vie de mon mari
beaucoup plus que la mienne.
Madame, il y a une autre plainte.
Que vous êtes désinvolte et que
vous vous montrez trop au peuple.
Que vous vous réjouissez
de leurs acclamations,
leur souriant, vous courbant
et les saluant.
En conséquence, nous supposons
que vous détestez le Roi.
Pourquoi supposeriez-vous cela ?
Car vous ne voulez
pas accepter, Madame,
que durant tout ce temps
vous viviez avec lui dans le péché.
Et même quand la vérité
a été révélée,
vous refusez d'accepter
la gracieuse proposition du Roi
de vous retirer au couvent.
Ah, encore cela !
J'y ai déjà répondu.
Dieu ne m'a jamais
appelée au couvent.
Je suis l'épouse véritable
et légitime de sa Majesté.
Madame, pour l'amour de Dieu...
Oui, pour l'amour de Dieu !
Comme vous l'avez vous-même
professé, Archevêque !
Vous avez dit à certains
que mon cas était légal.
Alors, qu'est-ce qui vous
à fait changer d'avis ?
Serait-ce Wolsey ?
Dites-moi, préférez-vous votre place
sur cette terre à celle au paradis ?
- Vous n'avez pas répondu aux charges.
- Sir !
Je considère qu'il est en effet
difficile d'être poursuivie
et accusée par mes propres avocats !
Où est la justice en cela ?
Je n'ai plus rien à vous dire et
vous ne me représenterez pas.
Catherine,
pourquoi continuez-vous
à me refuser justice ?
Vous êtes impitoyable.
Si pleine de haine.
Je ne peux me persuader
plus longtemps que vous m'aimez.
Je vous aime.
Je n'ai jamais cessé de
vous aimer. Vous le savez.
Je l'ignore.
Peut-être devrais-je
vous éloigner de notre fille...
au cas où vous voudriez lui
empoisonner l'esprit contre moi.
Comment pouvez-vous
dire cela de moi ?
Après tout ce temps. Après tout ce
que nous avons été l'un pour l'autre.
Je vous demande seulement
d'être raisonnable.
Je suis raisonnable.
C'est vous qui ne l'êtes pas.
Que voulez-vous le plus, Thomas ?
- Vouloir ?
- De la vie ?
Que voulez-vous ?
Je l'ignore.
Voyager, je suppose.
L'aventure, si je peux.
Voyager ? Où iriez-vous ?
N'avez-vous pas su ?
Les conquérants des mers sont partis
vers le Nouveau Monde.
Cabot vers Newfoundland,
d'autres vers les Amériques, les Indes.
Quelques-uns parlent
de la Chine, Cathay,
les contrées fabuleuses
de Marco Polo.
Mais où voulez-vous aller ?
Je voudrais m'établir ici...
Mais les cheveux sont une forêt
d'embuscades et de pièges.
Mais le sourcil nous calme,
quand il est lisse et plat.
Les bassins sombres des yeux
sont dangereux pour notre bateau.
Y être entraîné
et ce serait le naufrage.
Le nez, ainsi que le premier méridien,
nous dirige en bas
vers les Îles Chanceuses,
des lèvres pulpeuses.
Je voudrais y jeter l'ancre.
et entendre le chant des sirènes.
Puis reprendre la mer,
passer le glorieux
promontoire du menton.
Nous pourrions croiser quelques îles,
en nous dirigeant en bas
vers votre Inde.
Nous faisons une pause
au nombril de l'Atlantique,
où le courant emporte notre bateau
vers une autre forêt,
où beaucoup ont sombré.
Et on ne peut aller plus loin.
J'ai une nouvelle devise.
Quelle est-elle ?
Vous devez la trouver !
Où est-elle ?
Sur un ruban,
caché quelque part.
Est-elle...
Ici ?
Non !
- Ici ?
- Non.
Est-ce sous cela ?
Je ne peux plus attendre.
Vous n'aurez pas à le faire.
Votre Majesté,
il y a de nouveaux retards !
Personne n'a vu Campeggio !
Où est-il ?
Dites-moi !
Et si quelqu'un attendait
délibérément ?
Retardait les choses ?
Créait des excuses ?
Campeggio ?
Non. Quelqu'un d'autre.
Quelqu'un de plus proche.
Je l'ai.
<i>Ainsi sera,</i>
<i>grogne qui grogne. </i>
C'est ainsi que ça doit être !
Faites-les grogner.
Quelqu'un de très proche.
Je voudrais vous parler
franchement de Campeggio.
Avez-vous confiance en lui ?
Pensez-vous qu'il soit compromis ?
Qui sait, peut-être reçoit-il
une rente de l'Empereur ?
À ce que je sais, Lorenzo est
le moins préjudiciable.
Il a personnellement souffert entre
les mains des soldats de Charles,
quand ils sont entrés à Rome
pour fouiller sa maison.
Je ne crois pas qu'il ait
de l'amour pour l'Empereur.
Alors, pourquoi retarde-t-il le procès ?
Il ya certains points techniques
qui doivent être résolus.
C'est tout.
Rien qui ne concerne Votre Majesté.
Soyez maudit. Ce n'est pas du tout
Campeggio, c'est vous !
Vous êtes responsable de ce retard !
Vous êtes devenu
frileux pour ce divorce.
Peut-être n'y avez-vous jamais cru !
Vous m'avez menti.
Vous prétendiez être de mon côté !
Majesté, je jure
devant vous et devant Dieu,
sur mon honneur, d'être
votre plus humble serviteur.
Et il n'y a rien sur Terre
que je convoite autant
que de faire progresser
votre divorce.
L'amener à terme est
ma quête perpétuelle,
et mon désir le plus ardent,
pour lequel je suis prêt à donner
ma vie, mon corps et mon sang.
Alors que Dieu
me vienne en aide !
Allons votre Grâce.
Ne soyez pas si consterné.
Comprenez mon impatience.
Je sais que ce n'est pas vous.
Je vous crois.
Je vous connais
depuis fort longtemps.
Allons, parlons d'autres choses.
Par le corps de Dieu,
Maître More.
<i>Indignatio
princeps mors est.</i>
La colère du Prince signifie la mort.
Majesté.
Je veux que vous vous rendiez
à Rome, M. Cromwell.
Je veux que vous forciez
sa putain de Sainteté à se soumettre,
si nécessaire en lui disant que
s'il ne m'accordait pas
ma putain d'annulation,
alors l'Angleterre
retirera sa soumission à Rome,
et je lui retirerai
mon allégeance.
Et assurez-vous qu'il sache que
ce n'est pas une vaine menace.
Je le pense et le ferais
s'il ne me satisfait pas.
Envoyez-moi le Duc de Suffolk !
Monsieur le Duc, le Roi vous somme.
Charles...
J'ai une tâche à vous confier.
Je veux que vous alliez à Paris
et rencontriez le Roi François.
Interrogez-le sur Campeggio.
Demandez-lui quel genre
de transaction il a eu avec lui.
Quel genre d'homme est-il ?
Est-il honnête ?
A-t-il des ambitions de Papauté ?
Et a-t-il des transactions
secrètes avec l'Empereur ?
Je pars sur le champ.
Et Charles...
Questionnez-le sur Wolsey.
Je veux savoir
tout ce qu'il sait sur lui.
Comprenez-vous ?
Je veux savoir
de quel côté Wolsey est.
Sir Thomas ?
Ma gracieuse Reine.
J'ai amené l'évêque Fisher
pour vous voir.
Je crois qu'il peut être
un conseil loyal et dévoué.
Merci, Sir Thomas.
Majesté.
Je vous en prie.
Lord Bishop.
Êtes-vous certain
de vouloir me représenter ?
Vous devez être conscient des dangers
et des difficultés
auxquelles vous ferez face.
Je comprendrais votre préférence
pour la paix et la tranquillité.
Gente dame, quelle paix
ou tranquillité peut-il y avoir
sans justice et amour de Dieu ?
J'ai soigneusement étudié
le dossier vous concernant.
Ils appuieront sans doute le fait
que la dispense papale
vous autorisant à épouser le Roi
était techniquement défectueuse
et donc invalide.
Mais...
la façon la plus évidente de résoudre
pareille erreur technique,
n'est pas de déclarer
le mariage nul et non avenu,
mais de délivrer une nouvelle
et parfaite dérogation.
En tout cas, une si longue durée
a rendu le mariage honnête.
Et le principe de "Supplet Ecclesia",
"Laissez l'église y suppléer",
a rendu bon n'importe quels défauts
dans la dérogation papale.
Vous supposez donc
que nous allons gagner ?
Oui, nous pouvons gagner
avec ces arguments, mais
je ne peux pas prétendre
que cela nous servira beaucoup.
Nous devrons toujours essayer.
Ayez confiance, Madame,
car nous sommes du côté des anges.
Les cœurs sont atouts.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
J'ai reçu des nouvelles de Cromwell.
On lui a finalement permis
de voir le Pape,
mais il m'a écrit désespéré.
- Pourquoi ?
Il ne croit pas que Clément fera
quoi que ce soit pour moi.
Il a dit que c'est peut être son Pater
Noster, mais qu'il ne pouvait rien faire
Cela signifie que le Pape prierait pour
mes problèmes mais il ne s'engagera pas
à faire quelque chose à ce sujet !
Montrez !
Montrez-moi !
Oui. Nous avons amusé le représentant
du Pape lors de son passage ici.
Et j'ai parlé personnellement
à Campeggio.
Il était très prudent.
Mais même s'il s'est peu exprimé,
je l'ai senti hésitant.
De quelle manière ?
Je pense qu'il montre une face,
mais en cache une autre.
On lui demande de traiter une question
qu'il méprise secrètement.
Ainsi mon conseil à mon frère, le Roi
est de ne pas avoir trop
confiance en tout homme,
pour ne pas être déçu.
Et diriez-vous de même
du Cardinal Wolsey ?
Je n'ai rien contre Son Éminence.
Bien sûr que non.
Mais que pensez-vous de
son attitude envers le divorce ?
Autant que je puisse dire,
il veut que le divorce ait lieu,
car il n'aime pas la Reine.
En même temps...
En même temps ?
J'ai aussi l'impression qu'il a
une merveilleuse entente avec le Pape.
Ils se comprennent.
Et également avec le
Cardinal Campeggio.
Donc, s'il a une telle entente avec eux
et qu'ils ne sont pas disposés
à faire avancer l'affaire du Roi, alors
franchement, je pense que le Roi
devrait s'y intéresser lui-même.
Tel est mon conseil.
Où va-t-il ?
Sûrement entretenir
sa dernière maîtresse.
Pourquoi ferait-il cela
quand il a une si belle épouse ?
Vous devriez lui demander,
Monsieur.
Vous ne voulez pas le lui faire payer ?
Évidemment. Tout le temps.
Je suis une femme.
Alors couchez avec moi.
Si vous voulez.
Mais dites-moi d'abord.
Comment va votre belle épouse ?
- Elle...
- Elle est comme moi, non ?
Vous avez des affaires et elle l'ignore.
Pour faire l'amour
par vengeance ou par douleur...
Qu'est-ce cela ?
Cela blesse l'esprit et l'âme...
... rétréci. Oui ?
Vous comprenez ça, Monsieur ?
L'âme s'amenuise.
Et parfois elle meurt.
- Votre Grâce.
- Votre Grâce.
Laissez-nous.
Le procès s'annonce.
En effet, Votre Grâce.
Je veux vous expliquer à nouveau.
Si vous refusez
d'accorder ce divorce,
vous provoquerez une extraordinaire
opinion contre le Pape,
contre la cour papale et
contre la papauté elle-même !
Je suis tenu vis-à-vis
du Saint-Père,
de chercher la vérité et
la justice dans cette affaire.
Et c'est ce que je tenterai
de faire, Votre Grâce.
Et Dieu m'en est témoin.
Vous ne semblez pas toujours comprendre.
Alors, laissez-moi vous l'expliquer
plus clairement.
Si vous échouez à trouver
faveur auprès du Roi,
vous perdrez le Roi...
et la dévotion de son royaume à Rome.
Et vous me détruirez aussi.
Et cela je ne peux l'admettre !
Je comprends totalement.
Faites preuve de foi,
Cardinal Wolsey.
Que Dieu me vienne en aide.
Milords,
il est devenu évident que Wolsey
est sévèrement compromis.
Et il ne jouit plus des affinités
qu'il avait avec Sa Majesté.
Le Roi est soupçonneux
envers son premier ministre
et nous devons encourager
ses suspicions.
Il est temps de le mettre à terre.
Voilà un pamphlet.
Vous voyez qu'il traite sa période de
fonction comme un temps de vanité,
de perte, de répression
et de politique inefficace.
C'est prêt pour la distribution.
Nous appellerons à l'arrestation
immédiate de Wolsey et de ses agents,
la confiscation
de tous leurs documents,
et un examen minutieux
de son administration.
Sa corruption sera étalée
et la trahison garantie.
Tout ce qui reste, Boleyn,
c'est que votre fille prouve au Roi
que toutes ses suspicions
sont justifiées.
Et alors...
le Cardinal sera nu
face à ses ennemis.
- À l'Angleterre.
- À l'Angleterre.
<i>Église de Blackfriar
- Londres -</i>
- Jésus Christ !
- Désolé, désolé.
- Je suis désolé.
- Chien !
<i>In nomine patris
et filii et spiritus sancti. </i>
Amen.
Je déclare que cette cour de légation,
sous l'autorité de
Sa Sainteté le pape Clément,
est à présent en session.
Et tout ce qui sera dit ici
est dit sous le serment
et en présence
de Dieu tout-puissant.
J'appelle Sa Majesté,
à s'exprimer en premier
sur cette question.
Vos Éminences savent parfaitement
la cause de ma présence ici.
Cela concerne de nombreux scrupules
que j'ai pour mon mariage,
chatouillant ma conscience.
J'ai consulté longuement
pour découvrir la vérité,
et j'ai lu dans le Lévitique
qu'il était contre les lois de Dieu,
et un péché pour moi,
d'épouser la femme de mon frère.
Vos Éminences,
Je ne suis pas le seul à mettre en doute
la validité de mon mariage.
Tout mes évêques
partagent mes doutes.
Et ils ont signé une pétition
pour mettre matière à la question.
Milords, je tiens à préciser que,
je n'ai jamais signé de mon nom pareil
document. Et s'il apparaît ici...
La cour ne vous a pas invité
à vous exprimer, Votre Grâce...
S'il apparaît ici,
alors l'évêque Tunstall
l'a écrit, sans mon consentement !
Le Roi a la parole
Asseyez-vous, Sir. Assis !
Bien, je ne vais pas en débattre
avec vous maintenant.
Après tout, vous n'êtes
qu'un seul homme.
Quant à la question principale,
si on me demande
pourquoi ai-je attendu si longtemps
pour amener l'affaire devant la cour,
je répondrais sincèrement
que c'était le grand amour
que j'ai porté à sa Majesté,
qui m'a empêché de le faire.
C'est moi-même qui doit assumer
toute la responsabilité,
de ma conscience, qui me
trouble et me fait douter.
Messieurs de la cour,
je ne demande qu'une seule chose.
La justice.
Dans un moment, la cour appellera
Sa Majesté la Reine
pour répondre à la déclaration du Roi,
mais je dois d'abord dire à la cour
que la Reine a cherché,
par ses conseillers,
à mettre en doute la compétence
de cette cour pour traiter de son cas.
De plus, elle met en doute
l'impartialité de ses juges.
Et finalement, elle affirme
que cette question est déjà
entre les mains d'une plus
grande autorité, le Pape,
et ne peut donc être
traitée qu'à Rome.
Maintenant,
quant à la première question,
le Cardinal Campeggio et moi
pouvons confirmer que nous avons
l'autorisation nécessaire
de Sa Sainteté,
pour régler cette affaire ici.
De plus, nous rejetons toute
notion de préjugé de notre part
et nous continuerons
à traiter ce cas ici
pour lequel
nous avons été désignés.
J'appelle donc Sa Majesté,
la Reine Catherine,
à s'adresser à la cour.
Milord.
Sir.
Je vous implore...
Pour tout l'amour
qu'il y a eu entre nous,
accordez-moi justice et droit,
donnez-moi pitié et compassion,
car je ne suis qu'une
pauvre femme et une étrangère
née en dehors
de votre domination.
Je n'ai pas d'amis ici
et peu de conseillers.
Je m'en remets à vous comme le
sommet de la justice dans ce royaume.
Je prends à témoin Dieu
et le monde entier
que j'ai été pour vous loyale,
humble et obéissante épouse,
toujours à l'écoute de vos
désirs et de vos plaisirs.
J'ai aimé ceux que
vous avez aimés, pour vous,
que j'aie eu raison ou pas,
qu'ils aient été mes amis ou ennemis.
Par moi, vous avez eu
de nombreux enfants,
bien qu'il ait plu à Dieu
de les rappeler de ce monde.
Mais lorsque vous m'avez épousée,
je prends Dieu comme seul juge,
j'étais parfaitement vierge,
aucun homme ne m'avait touchée.
Et que cela soit vrai ou ne le soit pas,
je le laisse
à votre conscience.
Que fait-elle ?
Catherine, Reine d'Angleterre !
Revenez à la cour !
Revenez à la cour !
Votre Majesté devrait peut-être revenir,
vous êtes appelée.
Cette cour n'a aucun sens pour moi.
Donc, je n'y resterais pas.
Catherine, Reine d'Angleterre !
Revenez à la cour !
Elle crache sur les lois du Pape !
Elle méprise cette cour !
Votre Majesté.

Est-ce Maîtresse Boleyn ?
La fille pour laquelle le Roi
veut sacrifier son mariage
ŕ la plus gracieuse
et charmante des reines.
J'ai reçu une pétition disant que
le divorce a l'appui du peuple anglais.
Les gens aiment leur Reine
et ont toutes les raisons de le faire.
Vous dites que le Prince Arthur
ne vous a pas touché ?
Vous ętes donc arrivée vierge
dans la couche du Roi ?
Je suis l'épouse véritable
et légitime de Sa Majesté.
Un ami commun m'a envoyé.
Il contient de bonnes critiques
sur la papauté
et sur l'arrogance
et l'abus des prętres.
Je ne peux plus attendre.
Vous n'aurez pas ŕ le faire.
Et si quelqu'un ralentissait
les choses délibérément ?
- Campeggio ?
- Non.
Quelqu'un de plus proche.
Soyez maudit. Ce n'est pas du tout
Campeggio, c'est vous !
Vous ętes responsable de ce retard !
Vous m'avez menti,
prétendant ętre de mon côté !
Majesté, je jure
devant vous et devant Dieu,

Milords.
En l'absence de la Reine,
que ce tribunal a proclamée rebelle,
puisqu'elle n'a pas paru
suite ŕ notre appel,
nous essayons de déterminer
si son premier mariage
au prince Arthur,
était en fait consommé
"in carnal copula".
Nous appelons un témoin,
Sir Anthony Willoughby.
J'ai cru comprendre que
vous étiez dans l'escorte
emmenant le Prince Arthur
ŕ son lit nuptial !
J'y étais, Sir.
Mon pčre était, en ce temps,
régisseur de la demeure du Roi,
j'étais donc présent
quand le Prince a été...
introduit... dans le lit
de Lady Catherine.
Et aussi ŕ son réveil le matin.
Le Prince vous a-t-il dit
quoi que ce soit ŕ son réveil ?
Oui, Sir, il a dit,
"Willoughby, j'ai soif,
apportez-moi une pinte de bičre.
La nuit derničre, j'étais
au beau milieu de l'Espagne."
Silence !
Silence dans la cour !
Autre chose ?
Oui, Sir, plus tard ce jour-lŕ,
il nous a dit,
"Maître, c'est un bon passe-temps
d'avoir une femme !"
Silence dans la cour !
Je crois que nous pourrons avoir
les draps tâchés de sang
pour corroborer le récit de Milord.
Cela serait trčs utile,
Votre Éminence.
Trčs utile !
- Votre Majesté.
- Messieurs.
Le Roi demande pourquoi
vous n'ętes pas ŕ la cour.
J'ai déjŕ répondu ŕ cela.
Pouvons-nous parler en privé ?
Pourquoi, je n'ai rien ŕ cacher !
Que mes dames et le monde entier
écoutent ce que vous avez ŕ dire !
Le Roi ordonne que vous mettiez
toute cette affaire entre ses mains,
autrement la cour vous condamnera.
Je suis surprise
de recevoir pareille requęte
d'un homme aussi
sage et noble que vous !
Je ne suis qu'une pauvre femme,
dépourvue d'esprit
et de compréhension !
Comment suis-je sensée répondre
ŕ une requęte qui
me met hors de moi ?
Vous savez parfaitement ce que
le Roi veut et ce qu'il doit avoir.
Tout ce que je sais, Éminence,
est que vous, pour vos
propres intéręts,
avez allumé ce feu.
Tout ce temps,
toutes ces années,
j'étais émerveillé par votre grande
fierté et votre gloire vaine.
J'ai exécré votre vie voluptueuse
et n'avais aucun respect
pour votre pouvoir présomptueux
et votre tyrannie !
Je connais aussi votre malice
envers mon neveu l'Empereur.
Vous le haďssez
comme un scorpion !
Et pourquoi ?
Car il n'a pas satisfait
vos ambitions
- et fait de vous Pape, par la force.
- Vous ne devriez jamais présumer sav...
Ma seule satisfaction
est qu'en vous frustrant,
je hâte votre chute
dans l'estime du Roi.
Un résultat que je désire
avant tout autre.
Attendez, Votre Éminence.
Vous n'aurez pas votre
divorce de cette maničre.
C'est la seule maničre !
Ami, donne-moi ŕ boire, j'ai soif !
Et si vous aviez tous
été en Espagne
autant de fois que moi
la nuit derničre,
vous seriez aussi
des putains d'assoiffés.
Dedans, dehors... !
Et je vous dirai ceci, les gars.
La premičre fois que
j'ai couché avec une Lady,
je n'étais qu'une fiente.
Pas plus longue qu'une sauterelle.
je l'ai fourrée toute la nuit...
Un toast !
J'ai dit un toast !
Ŕ la Reine Catherine,
qui n'a rien donné.
Que Dieu la bénisse !
Ŕ la Reine d'Angleterre !
Sa Majesté le Roi !
- Milords.
- Majesté !
Splendide !
Donc, mes sources
viennent de m'apprendre,
que l'Empereur croit que Wolsey
est l'instigateur du divorce.
Il pense que le peuple
va bientôt se révolter,
et conduire cette créature
ŕ l'échafaud.
Sa fin approche sűrement.
Aprčs quoi, votre Grâce
sera le premier homme de la cour !
Comme vous deviez l'ętre.
Auquel cas, Boleyn,
je n'hésiterais pas ŕ promouvoir
les intéręts de votre famille.
Il est vrai que
vous ętes monté haut, mais...
vous monterez
plus haut encore.
Avez-vous vu,
ils vous regardaient tous !
Je suis content,
je veux qu'ils vous regardent.
Je veux les voir envieux !
Je veux qu'ils sachent tous
combien je vous aime !
Alors comme la devise
de ma famille, je suis...
"la plus heureuse."
Comment s'est passée
la cour, aujourd'hui ?
Assez bien.
Catherine refuse encore d'y assister.
Cela ne fera aucune différence.
Wolsey m'a promis que
j'aurais mon divorce d'ici l'été.
Les promesses sont faciles.
Et si ce n'était pas le cas ?
Margaret, qu'y a-t-il ?
Je n'arrive pas ŕ dormir.
Revenez dans le lit, il fait froid.
Pas encore.
Je me rends ŕ la cour demain,
voulez-vous m'accompagner ?
Votre frčre a demandé,
une fois encore, votre présence.
Je vous l'ai dit...
pas tant qu'il...
fait l'amour en public
avec la fille de Boleyn.
C'est offensant et ça le fait
passer pour un imbécile.
N'importe qui peut voir comment...
fiers et avides sont les Boleyn.
Pourquoi pas lui ?
Et s'il vous ordonne de venir ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Seulement d'une épouse...
ŕ un époux...
Dormez maintenant,
mon Charles chéri.
Je vous en prie, dormez.
Silence dans la cour !
En l'absence de la Reine,
nous avons été sollicités
par son conseiller, l'évęque Fisher,
pour faire une déclaration ŕ la cour.
Et dans ces circonstances,
nous avons décidé
que cette déclaration
est admise.
Votre Grâce.
Vos honneurs,
on vous a demandé
d'émettre un verdict
sur la validité du mariage royal.
Messieurs,
je suis convaincu,
que le mariage du Roi et de la Reine
ne peut ętre dissout par
aucun pouvoir, humain ou divin !
Laissez... laissez-moi
vous donner, si je puis,
un parallčle biblique.
Vous vous souvenez,
j'en suis sűr,le...
le tyran Hérode Antibas
- Tyran ! Tyran !
- Qui s'est débarrassé de sa femme,
dans le but d'épouser
la femme de son frčre.
Et qui a alors exécuté
Jean le Baptiste,
quand il a osé critiquer
le couple royal.
Ainsi que Jean Le Baptiste, moi aussi,
en toute humilité,
vous dis ici en ce jour,
que je suis pręt
ŕ perdre la vie,
ŕ perdre la vie,
pour défendre la sainteté du mariage,
et condamner l'adultčre !
Outrage !
Votre Honneur.
J'accuse cet homme, Evęque Fisher,
d'arrogance, de témérité
et de perfidie.
Je demande que vous ignoriez
chaque vil mot.
Ah, Thomas entrez !
Un verre ?
- Pas pour moi, merci.
- Non.
J'ai une mission
pour vous Thomas.
Les Français et les forces impériales
ont cessé leur agression.
Il va y avoir une sorte de
conférence ŕ Cambrai, en France,
entre leurs négociateurs et aussi
avec les représentants du Pape.
Je ne peux y assister, bien sűr.
Mais la chose vitale, Thomas,
est qu'il n'y ait pas d'accord
entre les deux autres parties.
J'ai eu, en privé, l'assurance
du Roi de France
qui est aprčs tout notre allié,
qu'il ne fera jamais la paix
avec l'Empereur,
quelles que soient les circonstances.
Similairement,
il ne doit pas y avoir de rapprochement
entre le Saint-Pčre et l'Empereur.
Vous devez comprendre
qu'en de telles circonstances,
il serait impossible au Pape
d'accorder au Roi ce qu'il désire.
Oui, je crois comprendre.
Ŕ présent...
Je comprends que
vous ayez vos principes,
mais pour l'amour
que nous avons pour le Roi,
votre rôle ŕ Cambrai est d'ętre
le plus obstructif possible.
Ne laissez pas François renier
son engagement avec nous,
et ne laissez pas le Pape omettre
que ce sont les forces de Charles
qui ont envahi et saccagé Rome.
Oh, il y a autre chose.
Plus que cela ?
Essayez de savoir de façon
subtile, par ses agents,
si l'Empereur est pręt ŕ soutenir
sa tante en usant de la force.
Vous croyez qu'il pourrait envahir
l'Angleterre pour soutenir la Reine ?
Je ne crois rien...
mais j'imagine tout.
Et ce sont ces imaginations
qui me causent
de grandes peines, Thomas !
De grandes peines.
N'est-ce pas vous qui disiez,
"Nul homme ne peut s'attendre
ŕ aller au ciel...
... sur un lit de plumes" ?
N'avez-vous
rien de gentil a dire ?
Gentil ?
Ŕ votre épouse.
La mčre de votre enfant.
Vous me traitez si méchamment
et me négligez en public.
Catherine, vous devez
accepter l'inévitable.
Le poids de l'opinion académique
est contre nous.
Nous n'avons jamais été,
légalement, mari et femme.
Et la cour statuera
en ma faveur,
et si elle ne statue pas
en ma faveur,
je dénoncerai le Pape
comme hérétique
et épouserai qui je veux.
Chéri...
Par tout les anges, j'étais intacte
lorsque je suis venu dans votre couche.
C'est vrai, alors vous étiez
une putain de vierge !
Lŕ n'est pas le problčme !
N'ai-je pas dit que si vous vous
disputiez avec la Reine
elle s'assurerait d'avoir le dessus ?
- Oui, mais...
- Un beau jour,
vous succomberez ŕ son
raisonnement et me rejetterez !
Que voulez-vous dire ?
Anne...
- Je vous aime.
- Laissez-moi, laissez-moi !
Ne voyez-vous pas ?
Ne comprenez-vous pas ?
J'attends depuis
si longtemps, pour rien !
Alors que j'aurais pu contracter
un mariage des plus intéressant
et avoir des garçons ce qui est la
plus grande consolation dans cette vie.
Au lieu de cela, je perds mon temps
et ma jeunesse pour rien.
Anne, cessez cela !
Vous aurez des garçons !
- Nous aurons des garçons !
- Non, non...
C'est trop tard, votre femme
ne vous laissera pas.
Je devrais le reconnaître...
- Oů allez-vous ?
- Chez moi !
Restez, je vous en prie, Anne...
Je suis le Roi d'Angleterre !
Faites place pour sa Grâce !
Faites place !
Votre Éminence.
Merci, merci, merci.
Un message urgent du Pape.
Merci, gentil monsieur.
Regardez ! Il s'appuie
toujours sur quelqu'un.
Peut-ętre quelqu'un
pourrait s'appuyer sur lui.
Peut-ętre.
- Votre Éminence.
- Majesté.
Je crois que nous aurons
bientôt un verdict.
En effet.
Nous avons appris avec détresse
ce qui s'est passé en Allemagne.
La destruction des églises.
De mélancoliques événements, Majesté.
Mais quelles en sont les causes ?
Majesté ?
Je vais vous le dire.
Les Luthériens s'attaquent
ŕ l'immoralité de Rome.
Ils pensent que la corruption
y est récompensée,
mais que les pieux y sont
abandonnés et maltraités.
Je suis un homme de foi,
Votre Éminence.
Dieu préserve Votre Sainteté
de me tourner le dos.
Milord.
N'ętes-vous jamais
las de cela, Charles ?
Bien sűr.
Je vais alors dormir.
Je parie que vous ręvez
de femmes aussi.
Non. Je ręve de Dieu,
de paradis et d'enfer,
et de repentance.
Puisque vous me le demandez.
Ŕ quoi pensez-vous, Anthony ?
J'écoute la chanson et me dit :
Omnia vincit amor.
Omnia vincit amor.
"Nul ne peut résister ŕ l'amour".
Milord.
Majesté.
S'il vous plaît, dites
ŕ Anne de revenir ŕ la cour.
Je vous implore pour mon salut.
Je ne peux vivre sans elle.
Demain j'aurai mon verdict,
et je serais libre.
Majesté.
Éminences,
en accord avec les rčgles
et lois de ce tribunal
et les vśux de Sa Majesté,
je vous demande officiellement
de délivrer votre jugement.
Votre Majesté... Milords...
Aprčs maintes délibérations,
nous avons décidé que
cette affaire majeure est trop
importante pour ętre résolue ici,
sans consultation de la Curie ŕ Rome.
Malheureusement, la Curie
est maintenant en vacances d'été.
Auquel cas, il n'y a
aucune alternative
que de proroger le tribunal
jusqu'au 1er octobre.
Ceci est notre jugement.
Vous ętes un con stupide !
Par Dieu, il n'a jamais été bon
de vivre en Angleterre
depuis que nous avons des Cardinaux !
Ętes-vous si bęte pour penser
que cela soit mon śuvre ?
Et de tous ces gens,
vous avez le moins de raisons
d'ętre offensé par les Cardinaux !
Si ce n'était pas moi,
un simple Cardinal,
qui a parfois fait votre éloge,
vous n'auriez plus de tęte
sur vos épaules !
Bonjour.
En effet, Seńor Mendoza.
Campeggio a reçu des instructions
secrčtes venant de Sa Sainteté,
qui a suivi l'affaire depuis Rome.
Je n'ai pas été abandonnée.
L'Empereur a travaillé
sans relâche pour votre cause.
Est-ce vrai que vous partez ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
L'ambassadeur Chapuis
me remplacera.
Je le connais.
Il est la personne
la plus digne de confiance
et prendra votre défense
avec fidélité et diligence.
Comme vous,
Seńor Mendoza.
De ma part.
En ma mémoire.
Majesté.
Ah, Thomas, c'est trčs bon
de vous voir.
Comment est le Roi ?
Le Roi est...
... parti se promener.
Immédiatement.
Avec Lady Anne.
Je vois.
Dites ŕ sa Majesté
que je vais lui remettre,
immédiatement,
tout les revenus
du Sičge de Durham.
C'est l'un des
plus riches d'Angleterre.
Et dites-lui que je ne cesserai
d'śuvrer pour sa grande affaire.
Campeggio et moi accomplirons
volontiers son désir légal.
Voyez-vous ?
Je lui dirais.
Et Thomas...
Dites-moi que je peux
avoir confiance en vous
pour pręcher mon
intéressement au Roi.
Vous pouvez.
Sans vous, je ne serais
qu'un modeste clerc,
sans intéręt ni avenir.
Je vous dois ma vie.
J'ai été convoqué ŕ Rome.
Je dois paraître devant le Pape
et répondre de moi-męme.
Pouvez-vous l'imaginer ?
Moi, le Roi d'Angleterre,
qui ne répond ŕ nulle autorité
que celle de Dieu !
Maudit Wolsey.
Qu'il aille en enfer.
Puis-je parler franchement ?
Oui, bien sűr.
Il y a certains qui, de source sűre,
ne se soucient gučre des Papes.
Ces auteurs disent que le Roi
est ŕ la fois Empereur et
Pape absolu dans son royaume.
Quels auteurs ?
J'ai un livre ŕ vous montrer.
Avec votre permission.
Montrez-le-moi.
<i>Doucement l'amour
et aimer doucement.</i>
<i>Rosée sur la branche de sycomore. </i>
<i>Par la porte grinçante.</i>
<i>Oů mon cśur se dépęche ensuite</i>
<i>par le chemin de blé</i>
<i>le long des ronces,
vers cette pierre... </i>
<i>sous laquelle je me couche... </i>
Merci pour cette audience,
Votre Majesté.
- Trčs bien, Milords.
- Majesté.
Lord Rochford ?
Majesté, le nouvel
Ambassadeur Impérial,
Mr. Chapuis, demande la permission
de présenter ses lettres
de créance ŕ la Reine.
Accordé.
Y a-t-il autre chose, Milord ?
Majesté, le Cardinal Campeggio
retourne ŕ Rome
et voudrait prendre formellement
congé de votre Majesté.
Trčs bien.
Mr. Cromwell.
Invitez-le ici, ŕ Grafton House.
Ainsi que Wolsey.
Autre chose ?
Votre Grâce ?
Majesté, pardonnez-moi.
Margaret est morte.
Elle est morte de tuberculose.
Vous ne m'avez jamais dit
qu'elle était malade !
Si c'est la sśur du Roi,
pourquoi n'est-il pas lŕ ?
- Le Roi ne peut venir aux funérailles.
- Pourquoi ?
Nul n'est autorisé
ŕ imaginer la mort du Roi.
Ce serait une trahison.
Vous preniez soin de moi.
Je suis désolé.
Venez, venez, Thomas !
Dites-moi ce qui c'est passé.
J'espčre que vous ętes arrivé
ŕ Cambrai au bon moment ?
Pas exactement.
Nous étions en retard d'une semaine.
Une semaine ?
Alors, comment avez-vous pu
contribuer aux débats principaux ?
Nous n'avons pas pu.
Nous n'étions pas informés
des débats principaux.
Nous avons seulement
pu entrer dans...
des négociations secondaires
avec les majeures parties.
Quelles négociations ?
Bien, je suis heureux d'annoncer
que nous avons garanti
des relations commerciales mutuellement
avantageuses entre nous et les Pays-Bas.
Nous avons aussi obtenu
des garanties concernant
les payements de longue durée
dus au Roi par l'Empereur.
Mais le conflit majeur, Thomas !
Le conflit majeur !
Que s'est-il passé ? Le Roi
de France a-t-il refusé la paix ?
Non.
Au contraire, il a réglé tous
ses différends avec l'Empereur.
Et chacun d'eux a réglé ses différends
avec Sa Sainteté le Pape Clément.
En d'autres termes, nous
avons été délibérément écartés.
Si vous voulez
le voir de cet angle.
Maintenant, il n'ya aucune chance que
le Pape accorde au Roi son divorce.
Dites-moi, Thomas...
Que pensez-vous avoir
accompli ŕ Cambrai,
qui puisse vous rendre si satisfait ?
Avec respect, Votre Éminence,
ŕ un certain degré, je n'y étais pas
pour réaliser quoi que ce soit.
Encore que je pense que cette diplomatie
a été quelque peu couronnée de succčs.
Une fois encore,
il y a la paix en Europe.
L'Angleterre est en paix avec l'Empire.
Et par-dessus tout,
l'autorité papale
est restaurée et reconnue.
C'est ŕ cela que je crois.
François m'a trahi.
François a vu la futilité de la guerre.
Il a reconnu
la nécessité de la tradition.
Et vous, Thomas...
Vous m'avez détruit.
Faites place !
Par ici, Votre Excellence.
La chambre de Votre Honneur.
Merci.
Attendez. Attendez !
Oů est ma chambre ?
Il n'y en a aucune de pręte
pour vous, Votre Éminence.
Mais...
Je dois changer
mes vętements de voyage.
Alors, vous devriez chercher ailleurs.
Votre Éminence.
Ah, Mr. Norris ?
Utilisez ma chambre.
Elle n'est pas grande, mais...
Je ferais monter votre malle.
Quand vous vous serez changé,
rejoignez-nous ŕ la chambre de présence.
Je vous suis reconnaissant, Norris.
Il y a beaucoup de personnes ici, sir,
qui ont de multiples raisons
de vous ętre reconnaissant.
Quoique hélas,
ils ne le montrent pas.
Les Cardinaux Wolsey
et Campeggio.
J'ai su que vous étiez souffrant.
Est-ce vrai ?
Majesté, quand ai-je été assez
souffrant pour ne pas vous servir ?
C'est ce que j'ai pensé !
Ces gens disent de tels mensonges !
Qui puis-je croire ?
Nous avons fait un
long chemin ensemble, Cardinal.
Avez-vous pensé
que j'oublierais ?
Et il y a encore bien plus ŕ faire.
Je sais, je sais.
N'ayez crainte.
Nous parlerons
convenablement demain.
Bonjour, ma chérie.
Arrętez !
Écartez-vous,
je dois parler au Roi.
Écartez-vous !
Votre Majesté...
Majesté
Votre Majesté...
Majesté...
Ambassadeur Chapuis.
Votre Majesté.
Je suis venu sur invitation du Roi
pour présenter mes lettres
de créance de l'Empereur.
Je vous en prie.
Je suis contente de vous voir.
Votre mission est tombée
pendant une période compliquée.
En effet.
Je vois ma mission, Madame,
comme de "toute douceur."
Toute douceur !
Puis-je demander ŕ Votre Altesse
si je dois également présenter
mes lettres de créance ŕ son
Éminence le cardinal Wolsey ?
Cela n'est plus aussi
nécessaire qu'auparavant.
Le Cardinal est
quelque peu... défait.
On lui a refusé la permission
d'accéder ŕ la cour.
Alors qui dois-je voir ŕ sa place ?
Norfolk, Suffolk
et Rochford...
Ils sont maintenant les plus proches
du Roi et s'occupent de ses affaires.
Recherchez-les si vous
voulez savoir des choses.
Mais vous devez également
savoir, Ambassadeur,
qu'aucun d'eux
ne fait partie de mes amis.
En fait, il serait mieux de dire
que ce sont mes ennemis jurés.
Faites place !
Cardinal Wolsey !
Vous ętes accusé
de praemunire :
L'exercice de vos pouvoirs de légat
du Pape dans le domaine du Roi,
diminuant ainsi
l'autorité légale du Roi.
Vous ętes écarté
de toutes fonctions,
et tout vos biens seront mis
ŕ la disposition du Roi.
Je pense que vous avez une
autorité écrite du Roi pour cela ?
Vous ętes tenu de remettre
le grand sceau de votre office.
Et oů serais-je conduis ?
Ŕ la maison du Roi, ŕ Jéricho.
Pour attendre
le verdict de la cour.
Faites place ŕ Sa Grâce !
Ŕ présent, bénissez-moi,
Votre Éminence !
<i>Ŕ mon éternel ami, Cromwell</i>
<i>je vous implore,</i>
<i>comme vous m'aimez
et ferez tout pour moi,</i>
<i>de venir aujourd'hui,</i>
<i>dčs que votre travail sera fini
et en oubliant tout le reste. </i>
<i>Car non seulement, je vous
communiquerais des choses </i>
<i>pour mon propre confort
et mon soulagement,</i>
<i>mais j'aurais aussi votre bon,
triste, discret et avisé conseil.</i>
<i>Ŕ la hâte, ce samedi,</i>
<i>la main lourde et le cśur
triste de votre assuré,</i>
<i>qui vous aime.</i>
<i> Wolsey.</i>
Wolsey a plaidé coupable de
toutes les charges contre lui.
Oui, je l'ai su.
Et condamné ŕ la prison.
J'ai annulé sa punition.
J'ai męme consenti ŕ
le laisser garder l'Évęché d'York,
avec une pension de 3000 anges.
Vous voyez quel genre
de monstre je suis ?
Je dois désigner
un nouveau Chancelier.
Quelqu'un en qui j'ai confiance.
Vous avez une formation d'avocat
et ętes dans le service royal.
Vous avez un prestige international.
L'ami d'Erasmus,
le plus grand humaniste
de toute l'Angleterre.
Vous avez un esprit
vif et aiguisé.
- Non.
- Non quoi ?
Non, je ne veux pas ętre Chancelier.
Vous ferez comme je l'ordonne !
Écoutez Thomas.
Je sais que vous avez des scrupules
concernant mon divorce.
Et je vous jure,
il ne sera traité que par ceux
dont les consciences
sont en accord avec cela.
J'aurais besoin de vous
pour autre chose
qui jamais ne molestera
votre conscience.
Écoutez... Tom.
Je veux, nenni,
je vous ordonne,
pour toutes choses
que vous ferez...
de penser ŕ Dieu d'abord,
et ŕ moi aprčs.

"The Tudors."
Je suis convaincu que
ce mariage ne peut être dissout
par aucun pouvoir,
humain ou divin.
Vous savez parfaitement ce que
le Roi veut et ce qu'il doit avoir.
Ma seule satisfaction
est qu'en vous frustrant,
je hâte votre chute
dans l'estime du Roi.
J'ai un livre à vous montrer.
Ces auteurs disent que le Roi
est à la fois Empereur et Pape
absolu dans son royaume.
Chaque jour apporte plus de nouvelles
de la virulence de cette hérésie.
De quoi parlez-vous, papa ?
La maladie du Luthéranisme.
Ils ne viendront sûrement pas ici ?
Ils sont déjà là.
Vous me quittez !
Vous êtes marié !
Promettez que vous ne
chercherez plus à me voir.
Vous aimez un autre, c'est cela ?
Nous n'avons jamais été,
légalement, mari et femme.
Par tous les anges, j'étais intacte
lorsque je suis venu dans votre couche.
C'est vrai. Alors vous étiez
une putain de vierge !
Là n'est pas le problème !
Nous avons décidé que
cette grande affaire
est trop importante
pour être résolue ici.
Nous repoussons donc
le procès au 1er octobre.
Cardinal Wolsey,
vous êtes accusé
de diminuer
l'autorité légale du Roi.
Majesté... Votre Majesté...
Majesté...
Je dois désigner un nouveau Chancelier.
Quelqu'un en qui j'ai confiance.
Je ne veux pas être Chancelier.
Vous ferez comme je l'ordonne !
J'attends depuis
si longtemps, pour rien !
- Nous aurons des garçons !
- Non, non...
Votre femme ne vous laissera pas.
Je devrais le reconnaître...
Restez, je vous en prie, Anne.
Je suis le Roi d'Angleterre !

Sa Majesté le Roi !
Milords et conseillers,
il y a beaucoup de travail à faire.
Dans le passé, ceux qui tenaient
les rênes du gouvernement
m'ont déçu.
Beaucoup de choses ont été faites
sans mon consentement,
ni mon approbation.
Mais pareilles pratiques
devront cesser dans le futur.
Votre Grâce sera
nommée président du conseil,
conjointement au Duc de Suffolk.
Votre Majesté...
Nous nous réunirons
à nouveau très bientôt,
pour discuter des affaires
qui nous tiennent à cœur.
S'il vous plaît !
Bien que ça me plaise que
Wolsey ne soit plus parmi nous...
même en son absence...
... ne vous inquiète-t-il pas ?
De quelle manière ?
Il a été arrêté
mais pas pour trahison.
Ce qui veut dire
qu'il est toujours en vie.
Et tant qu'il vivra, il restera un
danger pour le Royaume et pour nous.
Il est loin, à York.
En disgrâce.
Je crois que vous
exagérez le danger.
Et je crois que
vous ne le comprenez pas !
Le Roi, comme vous le savez,
peut facilement change d'avis,
et s'il le fait et que Wolsey
revienne à cette cour...
nous aurons tous les deux assez
de raisons pour craindre sa vengeance.
<i>Église du Cardinal Wolsey
- Yorkshire -</i>
C'est intolérable. Nous devons
faire réparer le toit.
Avec quoi ?
Et par qui ?
Nous n'avons ni argent ni
maudits serviteurs.
Le Roi n'a sûrement pas voulu
que vous viviez si misérablement.
Après tout, vous êtes
encore archevêque d'York !
Ce n'est peut-être
pas la faute du Roi.
J'ai eu à me rappeler
la vieille prophétie :
"Quand la vache conduit le taureau,
le prêtre, se méfie pour son crâne."
Vous voulez dire cette
vache d'Anne Boleyn ?
En effet. C'est pourquoi
je lui écris cette lettre.
Même si elle est la cause
de toutes nos misères ?
Et bien oui. Si elle
en est la cause,
elle peut aussi en être le remède.
Je dois la persuader que
je ne suis pas son ennemi,
mais plutôt son ami.
J'ai encore les lettres
où elle me promettait
de me récompenser pour
mes peines et mes efforts.
En ce temps-là,
elle pensait devenir Reine.
Il me semble me souvenir
qu'en ce temps-là,
vous trouviez ses
promesses amusantes.
Oui, peut-être...
Depuis, j'ai... quelque peu
perdu mon sens de l'humour.
Sir Thomas, je vois que
vous ne vous permettez
aucun des attributs
dus à votre rang.
Je ne suis pas vaniteux
pour étaler ses pouvoirs,
Maître Cromwell.
Mais laissez-moi vous dire que
je compte pleinement les utiliser.
Puis-je savoir... dans quel but ?
Ici, par exemple.
Ceci est un rapport sur un sermon
récemment fait à Cambridge
par un certain Hugh Latimer,
un doyen de l'Université.
Mr. Latimer dit que "les Saintes
Écritures devraient être lues
dans la langue anglaise
par tous les Chrétiens,
qu'ils soient prêtres ou laïcs !
Il rage contre les icônes dorées,
la course aux pèlerinages
et la dévotion superstitieuse.
Il dit que tous les hommes
sont des prêtres
et que nous n'avons besoin ni
de prêtres ni de Papes sur terre."
Les temps ont changé,
Maître Cromwell.
Maintenant, je vois parfaitement
le risque et le danger s'infiltrer
par une telle politique d'ouverture
vers ces... nouvelles sectes.
Vous condamnez tous les réformateurs
comme des hérétiques ?
Wolsey était beaucoup
trop tendre avec eux.
J'ai l'intention de ne pas l'être.
Les brûlerez-vous ?
"Cette croyance que le Pape et
le clergé possèdent séparément
pouvoir et autorité,
est contraire aux Écritures.
Le Roi est le représentant
de Dieu sur terre
et sa loi est celle de Dieu.
Le dirigeant est redevable
seulement à Dieu
et l'obéissance de ses sujets
et celle requise par Dieu.
Quant à l'église et au Pape qui
dirigent les princes d'Europe
c'est non seulement
une honte immense,
mais une inversion de l'ordre divin.
Un Roi et une loi divine
dans tout royaume."
Ce livre est pour moi
et pour tout les Rois.
Et il y en a d'autres pareils.
Livres qui détaillent les abus
de pouvoir, de privilèges,
l'avidité du clergé
dans le royaume de votre Majesté.
Livres que Wolsey
vous a délibérément caché.
J'aimerais les lire. Maintenant que
j'ai plein pouvoir sur ma personne,
je travaillerais nuit et jour,
si nécessaire,
pour résoudre certaines choses.
Incluant mon annulation.
Je vous promets qu'à présent
tout sera différent.
Sa Majesté, le Roi !
Ambassadeur Chapuis.
Votre Majesté.
J'ai entendu dire que vous êtes
un diplomate compétent et intelligent.
Comme moi, vous êtes informé des
nouvelles controverses religieuses.
Je connais quelques nouvelles hérésies
qui ont
brusquement apparu ça et là,
certainement.
Si seulement le Pape et ses cardinaux
mettaient de côté
leur splendeur vaniteuse
et leur cérémonie
et commencer à vivre selon
les préceptes des Évangiles
et des premiers Pères.
Je suis conscient que
votre Majesté est au centre
d'une controverse avec Sa Sainteté.
Je ne parle pas de moi.
Voyez-vous, Excellence,
quand Luther a attaqué le vice
et la corruption du clergé,
il avait raison.
S'il s'était arrêté là et n'avait pas
détruit les sacrements,
j'aurais volontiers levé
ma plume pour le défendre,
au lieu de l'attaquer.
Le besoin de réformer
l'église est manifeste.
L'Empereur a le devoir
de le promouvoir.
Comme je le fais dans
mon propre Royaume.
Je suis content d'avoir eu
l'opportunité d'échanger nos opinions.
Votre Majesté.
Ambassadeur.
Je suis surpris
que vous ayez autant de temps.
- Pour faire quoi ?
- Rien faire !
Que voulez-vous dire ?
N'êtes-vous pas supposé
diriger le pays ?
Je laisse cela à Norfolk.
Il a plus d'entraînement.
Et dans tous les cas, les réunions
avec les Ambassadeurs
sont infiniment ennuyeuses.
Ce sont tous des vieux
menteurs hypocrites,
Auriez-vous préféré
que ce soient des femmes ?
Mon ami, si tout les ambassadeurs
étaient de belles femmes
j'aurais servi mon pays
jour et nuit.
Ah, nous y voilà !
Votre Grâce.
Laissez-moi vous présenter
ma pupille, Miss Catherine Brooke.
- Voici Anthony Knivert.
- Miss Catherine.
Anthony est l'un
de nos meilleurs cavaliers.
Sauf quand je tombe.
- Appréciez-vous votre promenade ?
- Oui.
Bien. Alors, je ne vous
retarderai pas davantage.
Une jolie petite, n'est-ce pas ?
En effet, elle l'est.
Je vais l'épouser !
Vous étiez en exil, M. Fish ?
Oui, Sir.
C'était le vœu du Cardinal Wolsey
de me garder en Hollande,
par crainte que je ne dise la vérité.
Alors, pourquoi avez-vous
essayé de revenir ?
Sir, j'ai pensé qu'avec la chute
et le départ du Cardinal
les circonstances dans ce pays
pouvaient s'améliorer.
Plus de tolérance.
Avez-vous des amis dans ce pays ?
Bien sûr, Sir, autant qu'un anglais.
À la cour ?
Avez-vous des amis à la cour ?
Niez-vous être l'auteur de cet écrit ?
"Une Supplication pour les Mendiants."
Non, Sir.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Sir, un appel à sa Majesté
pour corriger les terribles
et scandaleux abus de l'église.
Vous semblez suggérer
que le but réel de l'église
est de saisir tout pouvoir, autorité,
obéissance
et dignité du Roi.
En fait, vous allez beaucoup plus loin,
vous prétendez que l'église
elle-même est une source de
rébellion et de désobéissance
contre le Roi ! N'est-ce pas, M. Fish ?
Et ici, M. Fish, si je puis,
vous dites que les taxes
prises du peuple
ne sont pas remises à
un gentil Prince temporel,
mais à un cruel et diabolique
suceur de sang,
se nourrissant du sang des martyrs
et des Saints du Christ.
Honte sur vous, M. Fish.
Qui sont ces cruels et
diaboliques suceurs de sang,
si ce n'est les prêtres consacrés
de notre église sainte ?
Ceux qui nous montrent
la voie vers le paradis !
Mais vous n'y croyez pas
non plus, n'est-ce pas, M. Fish ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Je suis un chrétien,
l'enfant de la joie éternelle,
par les mérites de
la passion amère du Christ.
Ceci est la réponse joyeuse.
C'est aussi de l'hérésie.
Qu'est-ce cela ?
Que fait-elle ?
Elle porte du violet.
Et le violet est la
couleur de la royauté !
Vous savez, je regrette parfois
que tous les Espagnols
ne soient pas au fond de la mer !
Maîtresse Boleyn,
vous ne devriez pas insulter
l'honneur de la Reine
par un tel langage.
Je ne me soucie guère
de Catherine.
Je préfère la voir pendue que de la
reconnaître comme ma maîtresse !
Est-ce tout ?
Oui, Votre Majesté.
Dieu merci.
Qu'y a-t-il, M. Cromwell ?
Votre Majesté, je...
M. Cromwell !
J'implore l'indulgence et le pardon
de Votre Majesté, avant de...
Poursuivez.
J'ai eu, récemment, lors d'une
visite à l'abbaye de Waltham,
à parler à un confrère, là-bas.
Nous avons parlé de l'affaire
de votre Majesté.
Nous sommes arrivés à la conclusion
que les conseillers de Votre Majesté
ne pourraient, peut-être pas,
aborder la question
de la façon la plus commode
pour la résoudre.
- Vous voulez dire par les tribunaux ?
- Oui. Comme votre Majesté le sait,
les Rois sont au-dessus des lois.
Ils ne sont redevables
qu'à Dieu, seul, qui les a consacrés.
Il nous semble donc que
la question n'est pas
et ne sera jamais
du ressort de la loi.
Elle est plutôt théologique.
Mais dans ce cas, qui
devrait émettre un verdict ?
Nous suggérons que
votre Majesté prospecte
l'opinion des théologiens
partout en Europe.
Leur sentence serait
rapidement prononcée,
et pourrait être mise en œuvre
avec assez peu de moyens.
Et avec cette... simple mesure,
je crois que la conscience troublée
de votre Majesté serait apaisée.
Pouvez-vous rédiger un écrit
détaillant vos arguments ?
Si Votre Majesté me le permet.
Non, je vous ordonne de le faire.
Et je vous ordonne,
en tant qu'envoyé royal,
de parcourir les
Universités européennes.
Je veux l'opinion de leurs théologiens
aussi vite que possible.
Merci, M. Cromwell.
Il est encore temps d'abjurer
votre hérésie, M. Fish.
Si vous reconnaissez que...
vos idées étaient fausses,
diaboliques,
contraires aux lois de Dieu,
alors vous seront épargnées
les grandes douleurs
que vous devrez
autrement supporter.
Je vous en prie,
reconnaissez vos péchés.
Dieu vous accueillera
à nouveau parmi les siens.
Repentez-vous.
Repentez-vous,
vous avez encore le temps.
<i>Le seigneur est mon berger,</i>
<i>je ne manquerais de rien.</i>
<i>Il me fait reposer dans
de verts pâturages,</i>
<i> Il me dirige près
des eaux paisibles....</i>
<i> Quand je marche dans la vallée
de l'ombre de la mort, </i>
<i> Je ne crains aucun mal,
car tu es avec moi...</i>
<i> Ta houlette et ton bâton
me rassurent.</i>
<i> Tu dresses devant moi une table,
en face de mes adversaires,</i>
<i> Tu oins d'huile ma tête,
et ma coupe déborde.</i>
<i> Oui, le bonheur et la grâce
m'accompagneront,</i>
<i> tous les jours de ma vie,</i>
<i> Et j'habiterai dans
la maison de l'Éternel,</i>
<i> jusqu'à la fin de mes jours.</i>
J'ai quelque chose à vous dire.
J'ai décidé de vous anoblir,
vous et votre famille.
Vous serez fait
Duc de Wiltshire et Ormonde
et je vous nomme aussi
Lord du trésor privé.
George sera
Lord Rochford,
et sera fait membre du conseil.
Votre Majesté,
j'en perds mes mots.
Votre bonté est incessante.
J'ai aussi beaucoup d'espoirs
pour M. Cromwell.
J'en suis heureux.
C'est un ami de la famille.
Vous connaissez ses thèses ?
Je veux que vous rendiez visite
au Pape et à l'Empereur à Bologne.
Je veux que vous leur exposiez
notre nouvelle vision.
Je vous en prie, dites-moi
que vous ne perdez pas espoir.
Il est vrai. Je...
J'ai toujours
imaginé que le Roi,
après avoir poursuivi sa course
quelque temps, s'en reviendrait,
cédant à sa conscience,
et changerait son but...
comme il l'a si souvent fait avant.
J'ai cru de tout mon cœur
qu'il reviendrait à la raison...
Mais à présent, je...
Madame, je vous en prie.
N'abandonnez pas.
Non, Excellence.
Je n'abandonnerais jamais.
Merci pour ce que
vous avez fait pour mon père.
Pour toute ma famille.
Il y a plus...
J'ai fait des changements au vieux
palais de Wolsey à York Place.
Vous disiez que vous l'aimiez...
Je vous l'offre.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Vous ai-je attristée ?
Non.
Je ne serais malheureuse
que si vous cessez de m'aimer.
Londres devrait couler
dans la Tamise d'abord.
Il n'y en a que pour
Lady Anne, maintenant !
Sir Thomas, cela ne vous rappelle-t-il
pas un banquet de noces ?
Il me semble que tout y est
sauf le prêtre pour...
offrir les alliances
et prononcer la bénédiction.
Dieu nous en préserve.
Ce ne sont pas mes affaires.
Mon travail de Chancelier
sera de lutter de tout mon être
pour les intérêts de la Chrétienté.
Sa Majesté le Roi
est peut-être plus enclin
envers les réformateurs
que vous ne pensez.
Je ne pense pas.
Je le connais mieux
que vous, Excellence.
Ses instincts profonds
sont traditionnels et fidèles.
Il peut menacer
de rompre avec Rome,
mais je ne pense pas
qu'il le fasse.
J'espère que vous avez raison.
Les conséquences
seraient inimaginables.
Tout semble aller en
votre faveur, votre Grâce.
J'ai de mauvaises nouvelles.
Je viens d'apprendre que le Roi
a envoyé à Wolsey
une gravure de lui-même.
Et alors ?
Alors, c'est traditionnellement
un signe de bienveillance.
Cela peut présager
une réconciliation.
Un petit cadeau pour apaiser la
conscience du Roi est difficile à voir
comme un signe que l'évêque d'York
sera rétabli à sa gloire passée.
Pensez-y de cette manière : Après que
Satan eut été chassé du paradis,
a-t-il été invité à y retourner ?
Vous l'avez été.
Je vois que vous avez accepté
le parrainage de M. Cromwell, M. Wyatt.
Le monde est si transparent !
Mais ai-je eu tort
de le faire, M.Tallis ?
Je crois bien que oui.
Vous devriez être libre.
Ne soyez pas idiot, Tallis.
Vous ne survivrez pas longtemps dans ce
monde glissant sans l'appui d'un grand.
Vous pensez que M. Cromwell
est un grand homme ?
Non, je pense
qu'il le deviendra !
Vous verrez.
Pour ce que ça vaut,
je l'ai baisée !
Qu'y a-t-il, Thomas ?
J'ai eu une réponse à ma lettre.
De Maîtresse Boleyn ?
Que dit-elle ?
Qu'elle ne plaidera pas
ma cause auprès du Roi.
Nos espoirs sont donc finis !
Non.
J'ai décidé... d'écrire
à une autre dame
qui est beaucoup plus importante,
beaucoup plus importante que
cette putain malveillante.
Et probablement
beaucoup plus gentille.
Madame, le Roi est ici.
S'il vous plaît. Asseyez-vous.
Majesté.
Je suis venu car j'ai su
que vous étiez souffrante.
Et que les médecins ont dû
vous pratiquer une saignée.
Comment vous
sentez-vous maintenant ?
Je vais très bien.
Votre Majesté est gentil
de se montrer concerné.
Comment va notre fille ?
Elle m'a écrit dans un latin parfait,
me disant qu'elle danse
le gaillard chaque jour,
et qu'elle joue du luth à la  joie
et la satisfaction de tout le monde.
Vous devriez être fière d'elle.
Je suis... fière d'elle.
Vous devriez l'inviter à la cour,
vous pourriez la voir
danser et jouer.
Cela pourrait vous plaire.
- Catherine, je...
- J'ai su que plusieurs de vos agents
ont été envoyés à l'étranger pour réunir
des avis théologiques sur le divorce.
Pour chaque savant
qui vote pour vous,
je pourrais trouver des milliers
qui voteraient pour moi !
Milords...
Tous les jours
je suis tenu de lire
de nouveaux rapports d'insatisfaction,
de confusion et de retards
partout dans mon royaume.
Le trésor public est vide.
Et nous empruntons
de l'argent à un taux élevé !
Vos Grâces sont
les présidents du conseil
et pourtant, je n'ai pas de réponses
de vous sur ces questions,
ni sur d'autres.
- Que votre Majesté me pardonne...
- Je sais que je dois
toujours vous pardonner, mais je
commence à être las de vous pardonner !
Je vous ai tout donné,
incluant le droit de
vous faire appeler Prince !
Et qu'ai-je eu en retour ?
J'ai eu l'habitude de considérer
le Cardinal, vaniteux,
égoïste et avide,
comme vous me l'aviez suggéré !
Mais maintenant, je comprends
le fardeau qu'il a porté...
... sans complainte.
Votre Majesté ne devrait pas
oublier qu'il vous a... aussi volé,
et qu'il a servi l'intérêt des Français
parfois plus que
ceux de l'Angleterre.
Pensez-vous de même, Thomas ?
Il est certainement vrai
que le Cardinal était...
démesurément vaniteux.
Ce qui lui a énormément nuit,
et lui a fait abuser des dons
considérables que Dieu lui a octroyés.
Et pourtant...
il est meilleur que n'importe
lequel d'entre vous
pour gérer les affaires
de ce Royaume.
Je lui parlerai.
Oui, vous le devez !
Ambassadeur Chapuis,
Votre Majesté.
Ambassadeur.
J'ai une lettre pour votre Majesté.
De l'Empereur ?
Non. Du Cardinal Wolsey.
Ceci est... très étrange.
Savez-vous ce qu'il veut ?
Le Cardinal propose
de créer un rapprochement
entre vous et lui,
l'Empereur et Rome.
Le coup serait signalé
par l'arrivée d'un décret papal
ordonnant à Henri
de quitter Anne Boleyn
et de retourner à son mariage.
L'Empereur offrira
son soutien financier et moral,
et insistera pour que Wolsey
soit rétabli comme Chancelier.
Pensez-vous que
cela puisse marcher ?
Le Cardinal n'est rien
sinon ingénieux.
Je veux que vous établissiez
un nouveau parlement.
D'importantes choses
doivent être faites.
Mes caisses sont vides
pour commencer.
Je ferais comme
sa Majesté me l'ordonne.
Mais je dois vous prévenir que vous ne
trouverez pas ce parlement aussi...
docile que les précédents.
Comment cela ?
Bien, quoique je doive
avouer être parmi ceux
qui prônent une plus grande
tolérance et liberté d'expression...
Je crains que la liberté offerte
par la bonté de Votre Majesté
ne soit maintenant
ouvertement abusée.
Il y a beaucoup de voix
dissidentes dans le royaume...
Principalement pour les
questions religieuses.
Elles appellent à la réforme.
Combien en avez-vous
brûlé, Thomas ?
Six.
Tous légaux,
nécessaires et...
... et bien faits.
Bien faits ?
Oui, Harry.
Qu'a-t-il dit ?
En peu de mots,
il m'a dit qu'il est enclin
à pardonner Wolsey,
et à le rétablir dans
les faveurs royales.
Et qu'avez-vous répondu ?
J'ai convenu avec sa Majesté que
le Cardinal avait beaucoup de talents.
Qu'avez-vous fait ?
J'ai convenu avec le Roi que
Son Éminence a beaucoup de talents.
Je ne peux croire cela !
N'avez-vous pas, vous-même,
parlé de la terrible vengeance,
qu'il exercerait sur nous,
si jamais il revenait au pouvoir ?
Ou peut-être ne pensez-vous pas que la
vengeance soit l'un de ses talents.
Je le pense, en effet.
C'est pour cette raison que je
cultive les bonnes grâces du Roi.
Votre Majesté sera ravie d'apprendre
que l'Université de Paris,
la plus grande de toutes,
s'est prononcée en votre faveur.
Et l'Italie ?
J'avoue que
les Universités y sont divisées,
mais Padoue, Florence et Venise
se sont toutes prononcées pour vous.
Espagne ?
Le pays de Catherine.
L'Espagne est contre.
Êtes-vous surpris ?
Et vous, Milord !
Êtes-vous arrivés à voir
l'Empereur et sa Sainteté ?
Comment vont-ils ?
Votre Majesté, l'Empereur
a refusé de me voir.
Et sa Sainteté ?
Le Pape m'a simplement donné cet édit,
à remettre à votre Majesté.
Que dit-il ?
L'édit charge votre Majesté d'ordonner
à Lady Anne Boleyn
de quitter la cour.
Il refuse la permission à
votre Majesté de se remarier
tant que la Curie Papale
n'a pas statué sur votre cas.
M. Wyatt.
- Je suis occupé.
- Il y a quelqu'un que vous devez voir.
- Pas maintenant, M. Wyatt.
- Cela concerne le Cardinal.
Votre Excellence.
Que puis-je faire pour vous ?
Milord, je vous demande
une très grande faveur.
Ce sont des temps troubles.
Il me semble que,
dans certains quartiers,
il y a maintenant une flagrante
et ouverte hostilité
contre notre Sainte Église, telle que
celle découverte en Allemagne...
Et qu'attendez-vous de moi ?
Je vous implore d'user de votre
grande influence, ici à la cour,
pour tirer l'Angleterre du bord
de la catastrophe et de la ruine !
Pour l'amour que nous avons
tous pour le Christ et ses apôtres.
Quels apôtres ?
Je ne crois pas que
le Christ ait eu des apôtres,
pas même Saint-Pierre !
Ces hommes étaient tous des menteurs
et des charlatans, qui prétendaient
suivre le Christ et parler en son nom.
Et ils ont bâti une église
sur la base de leurs mensonges !
Votre Honneur...
Votre Honneur... si reconnaissant .
Sir, voici Augustin
de Augustinis.
Le médecin particulier
de Thomas Wolsey.
Wolsey.
- Que savez-vous à son sujet ?
- Sir, je sais que Wolsey a recherché
l'aide de l'Empereur
et du P... P...
- Du Pape ?
- Oui, Votre Honneur.
Sa Sainteté, le Pape,
contre Sa M... Majesté.
-Ils ont communiqué ?
- Oui... Oui...Oui
- Et qui d'autre ?
Wolsey a conspiré
avec la Reine Catherine,
il a dit que c'était
la seule voie pour...
- ... retourner au pouvoir.
- Oui... Oui...
Le Roi doit en être informé.
Maintenant que vous connaissez
la vérité, vous devez agir contre lui.
Lui et ses pareils, prêtres et prélats,
pensent qu'ils peuvent contrôler
le royaume de votre Majesté !
Qu'ils sont plus grands que vous...
Et en prenant instructions du Pape,
Wolsey n'agissait-il pas
comme un agent étranger ?
La présomption du Pape !
Pensant qu'il peut vous dire...
À VOUS... quoi faire !
Ne bougez plus !
Au nom du Roi !
Debout !
Sortez de votre lit !
Thomas Wolsey, vous êtes
aux arrêts sur ordre du Roi,
et accusé de haute trahison.
Vous serez emmené à Londres,
où vous serez jugé.
Non, non, Joan.
Pas de larmes.
Ne pleurez pas pour moi,
je vous en prie.
Pardonnez-moi... de ne vous
avoir laissé aucun autre souvenir.
Non. J'ai notre vie
et tout ce qu'elle contient
qui me le rappelle.
Gardes, mettez-le aux fers.
Si j'avais servi Dieu avec
autant de diligence que le Roi,
il aurait tenu compte
de mes cheveux gris.
Avancez !
Joan...
Joan !
J'ai le regret d'informer votre Majesté,
que je ne peux plus servir
l'Empereur à cette cour.
Il y a tant de haine ici pour tout
ce qui est sacré et authentique
que ceux qui en parlent
effrontément m'ont forcé à partir.
Vous n'êtes pas à blâmer.
Vous m'avez toujours servi
avec sagesse et bonté.
Je ne l'oublierais pas.
Transmettez mon amour
à mon neveu.
J'informerai Son Altesse
de votre situation
et de la malice et de la méchanceté
de sa Majesté envers vous.
Oui, dites-lui.
Mais également cela,
pour l'amour que je porte
à ce pays aussi bien qu'à lui...
Il ne doit pas employer la force
contre sa Majesté ou son peuple.
Cela serait un pêché
contre ma conscience...
et contre Dieu.
Seigneur, nous n'avons pas parlé
aussi longtemps
ou aussi souvent
que l'on aurait du.
J'étais souvent dans
d'autres affaires.
Si je voulais le pardon
j'aurais dû le demander...
Mais pour tout ce que j'ai fait,
et tout ce qui me reste à faire,
il ne peut y avoir de pardon.
Et pourtant, je pense, que
je ne suis pas un mauvais homme.
Quoique de mauvais hommes
prient plus fort,
cherchant la pénitence,
et se croyant...
plus près du paradis que je ne le suis.
Je ne verrais pas ses portes Seigneur,
ni n'entendrait vos
douces paroles de salut...
J'ai vu l'Éternité, je le jure...
mais ça n'était qu'un rêve
et au matin tout était parti.
Je sais ce que je suis.
Et j'abandonne ma pauvre âme
à votre pardon.
Sachant parfaitement que...
je ne suis pas digne de
vos mains affectueuses.
Bienvenue... en ENFER !
M. Cromwell.
Majesté...
Le Cardinal Wolsey est mort.
Je suis désolé de l'apprendre.
Je voulais qu'il vive.
Comment est-il mort ?
Il s'est ôté la vie...
Nul ne doit le savoir.
Comprenez-vous ?
Personne.
Jamais.
Je finis mon jeu
et nous converserons.
Partez.
Partez.
PARTEZ !
Sir Thomas, je viens de l'apprendre !
Sur ordre de Sa Majesté,
quinze ecclésiastiques ont été arrêtés
pour avoir reconnu l'autorité de Wolsey.
Il y a aussi une loi au Parlement
qui reconnaît qu'en matière
temporelle et spirituelle, le Roi
est au-dessus de la loi et ne doit
rendre des comptes qu'à Dieu seul !
Que peut-on faire ?
J'ai en mémoire
ce que Wolsey m'a dit :
Que je dois seulement dire
au Roi ce qu'il devrait faire,
et non ce qu'il peut faire.
"Car si le lion connaissait sa force,
aucun homme ne pourrait le contrôler."
Nous sommes au bord de l'abîme...
et Dieu seul sait
ce qu'il va advenir de nous !
J'ai envie de vous.
- Je viens.
- Non. Vous ne devez pas.
Peut-être pourrez-vous trouver un moyen
de maintenir son intérêt plus...
longtemps ?
